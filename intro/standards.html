  <h1>Our Quality Assurance</h1>
    <p class="emp">As a fully registered institution of higher learning, Calvary Life Tutors has achieved international accreditation from <a href="http://www.cquality.org">Christian Quality Assurance</a> (CQA), meeting the <b>Standards for Accreditation</b> and complying with its internationally accepted policies.</p>
    <p class="it">By participating in evaluative processes, we at <strong>Calvary Life Tutors</strong> continuously work toward improving our quality and increasing our effectiveness, 
      in order <b>to reach excellence in every standard</b>. </p>
    <p> The following twelve Standards encompass the primary areas of our institutional activity and only highlight those basic truths, which are described as principles, which we implement in practice. </p>
    <h3 id="miss">1. Mission and Purpose</h3>
    <p> Our <a href="creed.html">Mission Statement</a> is clear and is explained by our purpose, aims, objectives and values. They have special central meaning for us since they define the character of the Institution and constantly direct our future. </p>
    <h3 id="plan">2. Planning and Evaluation</h3>
    <p> CLT has plans for the future development of its virtual platform of quality e-learning as a logical extension of its facilities into this new era of technology. This will enable us to offer <b>unparalleled educational service to nations</b> by bringing quality education and, therefore, general upliftment within their reach. Our learning opportunities will regularly be evaluated to be in line with our <a href="philosophy.html">philosophy</a> and educational standards of excellence. </p>
    <h3 id="gov">3. Organization and Governance</h3>
    <p> CU follows a federal or <b>decentralized governance system</b>. Local institutions in developing countries have opportunities to contribute within specific circumstances, cultures and levels of technology, to offer suitable programmes according to acceptable standards to local learners. This takes place within a working environment of peer scrutiny and quality monitoring through the effective mentoring of our tutors. </p>
    <h3>4. Programme and Instruction</h3>
    <p> Details of available programmes are published in the <a href="../student_info/prospectus.html">prospectus</a>. Included are the types of whole programmes, the philosophy and principles of design, <a href="../bible_schools/3_Information/From Short Courses to Qualifications.pdf">the course structure</a>, the aims and objectives of each course and which disciplines and <a href="../bible_schools/3_Information/Phases as Qualification Builders.pdf">specific fields of study</a> (majors and endorsements)  programmes are available. </p>
    <p class="cp"> For each programme listed we will indicate: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Courses </li>
      <li>Credits </li>

      <li>Undergraduate Programmes </li>
      <li>Graduate Degree Programmes </li>
      <li>Postgraduate Degree and Diploma Programmes </li>
    </ul>

    <h5> Scholarship and Research</h5>
    <p> CU expects Graduate students to be involved in community work. In order to be good tutors, faculty are chosen from those academics who are active in professional praxis and have suitable experience to give learner support. </p>
    <h5> Instruction</h5>
    <p> The <a href="../student_info/format_of_learning.html">learning steps</a> are clearly indicated. CU emphasizes: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Practical experience </li>
      <li>Presentation of the academic content (through contact sessions) </li>
      <li>Group discussion (even if only with the academic tutor) </li>
      <li>Text-book self-study </li>
      <li>Recommended reading and analysis </li>
      <li>Reading and research integration </li>
      <li>Proficiency in academic writing </li>
      <li>Attainment of practical skills through projects/experience</li>
    </ul>
    <p> The prospectus will also indicate the elements and methods of assessment used to grade learners throughout each programme. </p>
    <h5> Admissions and Retention</h5>
    <p> Our rules for admission are indicated with every programme. Articulation into advanced programmes, a description of the bridging courses as well as an outline of the RPL arrangements and transfer credits from other educational institutions are given. </p>
    <h3 id="fac"> 5. Faculty</h3>
    <p> The <b>Faculty Handbook</b> will list most of the relevant policies and procedures we adhere to. An overview of some of the most relevant aspects such as qualifications, duties, work-load, development, agreements, and yearly review is available on request. </p>
    <h3 id="serv"> 6. Student Services</h3>
    <p> Student services such as study counselling, leadership opportunity, financial support and student record integrity are provided by the local <b>institutions of higher learning</b>, <b>Learning Centres</b>, <b>Calvary Groups</b> and <b>academic tutors</b>. This is  in addition to the development work we can provide through the Internet and on CD-ROM. </p>
    <h3 id="lib"> 7. Library and Information Resources</h3>
    <p> A Resource Centre including the library, the obtaining of new books, their exchange arrangement, the facility for these, the times of use and the rules governing these is described by each local entity. A <b>Virtual Library</b> is established by links to the Internet where provision is made by numerous and autonomous organizations. </p>
    <h3 id="facil">8. Physical Resources</h3>
    <p> Local facilities such as laboratories, lecture rooms, halls, study desks and computer work stations, equipment, and grounds, their availability, servicing, planning for improvement and regulation are the responsibility of the local <b>Tuition Centres</b>. </p>
    <h3 id="fin">9. Financial Resources</h3>
    <p> Calvary Life Tutors has included in its budget the continuous improvement of its academic resources and its Internet provision through its interactive Website. Its financial management is in responsible hands to ensure continued student support in order to allow completion of the studies by the incoming class. </p>
    <h3 id="disc">10. Public Disclosure</h3>
    <p> CLT has arranged that adequate publications are made available to students that contain student-relevant information such as fees and refund policies, rules and regulations, programmes, entrance requirements, faculty members, services, and accreditation status. </p>
    <h3 id="int">11. Integrity</h3>
    <p> CLT has set standards of integrity to ensure good relations, academic freedom, non-discrimination, effective operation and compliancy to the <a href="http://www.cquality.org">Standards</a> of <a href="../bible_schools/2_Accreditation/Standards For Accreditation.pdf">Accreditation</a>. </p>
    <h3 id="val">12. Christian Value System</h3>
    <p> Calvary Life Tutors has adopted a <a href="stafaith.html">Statement of Faith</a> for the purpose of its ministry and theology programmes. This is to indicate to the students that the institution holds to a set of basic Christian beliefs and publicly states what these are.
