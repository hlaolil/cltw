    <h1><span class="sh">Historical Synopsis</span></h1>
    <p>The concept of a training course for the local church was conceived in the heart of Pastor Tony Wegerle in 1981 while he was at Bible College. As the concept grew through the years, Tony and his wife Priscilla, with the help of input from Paul Daniels from Word of Faith &ndash; Welkom, began to write, compile, illustrate and type the lecture notes for a two year course in their own church. This took years of intensive work. By the end of 1988 a two year curriculum had been completed and they implemented this course in their own local church. </p>
    <p>In 1988, Pastor David Griffiths ministered in their church and prophesied that <b>this concept is from the Lord</b>, and not conceived by man. It would be for the growth and extension of the Church, His Body. </p>
    <h3>Calvary Life Tutors</h3>
    <p>In 1989, their material came to the attention of Paul Banting. Paul started writing theological articles in 1968 and published Ministry material from 1982 onwards. The concept grew in reality and it was decided to published it as a training programme under the name <b>Calvary Life Tutors (CLT)</b> to enable local churches country-wide to operate a Bible School. Apart from editing the books, Paul also contributed to the writing of the course since 1990. A third and fourth year were planned to expand the course to about 5600 pages 9 years later. In 1992 publication in Afrikaans was started. </p>
    <p>Pastor David Griffiths, as well as various other institutions including several Pentecostal denominations, Calvary University and a team of 54 CLT advisers have scrutinized the material and have found it to be thoroughly evangelical and doctrinally sound. An overwhelming acceptance by various churches and denominations was experienced when 200 Bible Schools (with over 7,000 students) were started in the first 42 months of introduction. More than 270 Bible Schools with over 12,000 students are now using the CLT programme world-wide. </p>
    <p>Calvary Life Tutors has helped to train Pastors in 18 African countries as part of an African mission project funded by Hope-builders - Africa, which is headed up by Dr. Johan Gous. Material for evangelism and follow-up is also printed and subsidized. </p>
    <p>In the year 1997, CLT registered for recognition as a Private Higher Educational Institute which meant that it would be allowed to <b>offer training programs</b> for after Grade 12 learners. A requirement was to apply to SAQA as well in order to <b>accredit the programs</b> and the <b>quality assurance</b> of the institute (the operating methods, materials, tests &amp; lecturers). This was granted in February 2000 until CLT's withdrawal in order to focus accreditation internationally, through<strong> Christian Quality Assurance</strong>. </p>
    <h3>Five Tracks Structure</h3>
    <p>In late 1998 the course was structured into 5 tracks according to the <b>Five-fold ministry</b> of Eph 4:11-16 to form the credit-basis of a B.Min degree offered by some internationally based universities such as <b>Calvary University</b> and by nine other Pentecostal Seminaries in South Africa. The programmes from Bachelor up to Doctorate were accredited during 2000 to 2003 by <b>SAQA</b> and from then on by <b>CQA</b>, an <b>international standards body</b>. </p>
    <p>During 2000, training started on the academic (short course) modules, the <b>Diploma in Shepherding</b> and the <b>Diploma in Church Management</b> which is credited as a Bachelor in Ministry. This allows the pastoral student to complete his/her graduate studies at an institution of choice such as Calvary University. At the same time <b>RPL</b> (<b>R</b>ecognition of <b>P</b>rior <b>L</b>earning) was implemented to give credits to students who have studied before or have years of experience. The CLT Bible Schools act as a Mentoring Centres for such students. The DoE privately regards CLT as on the forefront of mentoring in South Africa. </p>
    <p>The <b>Master of Ministry</b> and<b> Doctor of Ministry</b> facilitation for Calvary University was announced in April 2004 which made available <b>postgraduate study-groups</b> in any one of ten specific field emphases. </p>
    <h3>Recognition from Universities</h3>
    <p>In July 2000, negotiations started with the <b>University of Pretoria</b> during which they indicated that the courses of CLT would be recognised by UP in order that CLT Masters degree students can for instance complete a Doctorate at UP. Negotiations could not go further when the theological faculty realized that recognition of prior learning (RPL) was not yet implemented as it should be.</p>
