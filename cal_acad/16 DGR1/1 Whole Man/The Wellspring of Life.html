  <h1>
The Wellspring of Life
</h1>
<p>
The human spirit is the incorporeal part of man. The Bible says that the human spirit is the very breath of Almighty God and was breathed into man at the beginning of God’s creation: <font color= "blue">“And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.” (Gen 2:7)</font>. 
It is the human spirit, the wellspring of life, that gives us a consciousness of self and other remarkable, though limited, “God-like” qualities. The human spirit includes our intellect, emotions, fears, passions, and creativity. It is this spirit that provides us the unique ability to comprehend and understand (Job 32:8, 18).</p>
<h3>
The Human Spirit
</h3>
<p>
The words spirit and breath are translations of the Hebrew word <i>neshamah</i> and the Greek word <i>pneuma</i>. The words mean “strong wind, blast, or inspiration.” <i>Neshamah</i> is the source of life that vitalises humanity (Job 33:4). It is the intangible, unseen human spirit that governs man’s mental and emotional existence. The apostle Paul said, <font color= "blue">“For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him?” (1 Cor 2:11)</font>. Upon death the <font color= "blue">“the spirit will return to God who gave it.” (Eccl 12:7; see also Job 34:14-15; Psa 104:29-30)</font>.</p>
<p>
Every human being has a spirit, and it is distinct from the “spirit,” or life, of animals. God made man differently from the animals in that He created us <font color= "blue">“in His own image; in the image of God (Gen 1:26-27)</font>. Therefore, man is able to think, feel, love, design, create, and enjoy music, humour, and art. And it is because of the human spirit that we have a “free will” that no other creature on earth has.</p>
<p>
The human spirit was damaged in the fall. When Adam sinned, his ability to fellowship with God was broken; he did not die physically that day, but he died spiritually. Ever since, the human spirit has borne the effects of the fall. Before salvation, a person is characterised as spiritually “dead” (Eph 2:1-5; Col 2:13). A relationship with Christ revitalises our spirits and renews us day by day (2 Cor 4:16).<p>
<p>
Interestingly, just as the human spirit was divinely breathed into the first man, so the Holy Spirit was breathed into the first disciples in : <font color= "blue">“And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit.” (John 20:22)</font>. Adam was made alive by the breath of God, and we, as “new creations” in Christ, are made spiritually alive by the “Breath of God,” the Holy Spirit (2 Cor 5:17; John 3:3; Rom 6:4). Upon our acceptance of Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit of God joins with our own spirit in ways we cannot comprehend. The apostle John said, <font color= "blue">“By this we know that we abide in Him, and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit.” (1 John 4:13)</font>.</p>
<p>
When we allow the Spirit of God to lead our lives,<font color= "blue"> "The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,” (Rom 8:16)</font>. As children of God, we are no longer led by our own spirit but by God’s Spirit, who leads us to eternal life.</p>
