   <h1>
The Word of God
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
"For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways," says the Lord. "For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts. "For as the rain comes down, and the snow from heaven, and do not return there, but water the earth, and make it bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater, so shall My word be that goes forth from My mouth; it shall not return to Me void, but it shall accomplish what I please, and it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it.”  (Isa 55:8-11)</font>. </p>
<p>
Did you catch the main point here? The Lord is telling us that the rain and the snow water the earth and <i>Make</i> it bring forth fruit, and that His Word will do exactly the same thing in us. That is – The Word of God, when it is received into the ground for which it is intended – our spirit, soul, and body – will <i>make</i> that ground – our spirit, soul, and body – bring forth the fruit of the Word.<br> It’s because of this truth that God can say His Word will not return to Him void, without accomplishing that which He wills.</p>
<p>
We know for sure that God’s Word is His Will. He has told us repeatedly throughout scripture, both Old and New Covenants, that He created all that is natural by and through His Word – and that His Word will never fade away nor fail.<br> He tells us <font color= "blue">All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, (2 Tim 3:16)</font> or “God-breathed.” (Original Greek). So His Word has creative power in it, just as it did on the first day of creation, and has been sent to create the things of God – all that is of life, health, and holiness – in us.</p>
<p>
Now, let’s look at one specific set of His words that have been sent to accomplish a very specific and exact work. <br>
<font color= "blue">“My son, give attention to my words; Incline your ear to my sayings. Do not let them depart from your eyes; Keep them in the midst of your heart; For they are life to those who find them, And health to all their flesh.” (Prov 4:20-22)</font><br> The word translated health in this passage is actually a Hebrew word that is correctly translated “health” and “medicine.” So God tells us here clearly that His Word is medicine for all of our flesh. There’s nothing left out in the words “all their flesh.” There is no disease or physical affliction for which God’s Word is not medicine. But it’s even better than mere medicine. It’s medicine with a guarantee that it will restore health.</p>
<p>
When we couple that information with the information He gives us in <br>Isa 55:10-11, we find that His Word, when we apply it in faith as medicine to our physical bodies, will <i>make</i> our bodies bring forth the fruit of health.<br> “But,” you may say, “it’s not happening in my life or the lives of many people I know.” That is true. But just how many people do you know who will search God’s Word until they know exactly what it says about healing and until they are saturated in God’s healing Words? I don’t know many, but the ones I do know – including myself – have found that Word every bit as effective in fruit-bearing as those passages indicate.</p>
<p>
I have failed to apply it faithfully at times in my life and had to live with the results. But – every time that I have applied it – to my own body and to those of loved ones — to serious problems and minor problems alike – it has worked a healing and a cure – even when doctors said the body had been damaged too much to recover or that surgery was the only option. Moreover, hundreds of thousands of believers all over the world have found this same effectiveness for their bodies and have testified of it for generations.</p>
<p>
But, dear reader, you must not make the decision to believe God’s Word as your medicine based on the experiences of other people. You must make the decision to believe based only on whether you trust the Word of God. <br>He tells us, in absolutely certain terms, that His Word is His medicine for our bodies. <br>And then He also tell us that His Word is <font color= "blue">“living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow.” (Heb 4:12)</font> <br>Now, medical science tells us that all cell production takes place in the bone marrow. If that is the case, just think what can happen if we saturate ourselves with the Word of God enough to fill our bone marrow with it.<br> Since God promises that the Word –like the rain and snow – will <i>make</i> the ground bear fruit, then that Word in our bone marrow will <i>make</i> new, health cells for our body.<br> And when you get enough new, health cells in your body, they can go to work destroying the unhealthy cells, and in a matter of time, that sick body becomes a healthy body.</p>
<p>
Consider taking God’s Word seriously. Consider believing what He tells us.<br> And consider sitting down with the Word and reading it into your own body – especially the portions that speak healing and health – absorbing it regularly, faithfully – at least as regularly and faithfully as you would take the pills or the medical treatments a human doctor prescribes.<br>Give God’s medicine the same honour and attention that you give man-made medicine, and see if it doesn’t <i>make</i> your body bear a wonderful harvest of God’s health and life.</p>
