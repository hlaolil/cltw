Fasting that Pleases God
</h1>
<h3>
Fasting Correctly
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Moreover, when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, with a sad countenance. For they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men to be fasting. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward. But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, so that you do not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. (Matt 6:16-18)</font></p>
<p>
When you take a look at our culture, fast food places on almost every corner and countless opportunities to eat whatever you wish, even a committed Christian may never consider Fasting. Yet, one of the classic, Christian aspects of growing deeper in the faith is Fasting. Our minds are cleared to seek Christ without distractions and interruptions. Even though we may feel distraction with our stomach aching and growling, we can more easily pour ourselves out to the Lord.</p>
<p>
God tells us that Fasting is important, but Jesus sternly warns of abusing it by using it for a show and tell game to draw attention to oneself, thus missing the real purpose, that of drawing close to God, and seeking His Will for your life and church. This passage is in the context of pleasing God, where Jesus places Fasting in the ranks of prayer, spiritual commitment, and trusting Him, making it a vital, if not paramount component of spirituality, of growing deeper in Christian formation/spiritual growth.</p> 
<p>
When you fast: Jesus is assuming we will be following the Mosaic Law that required the Jews to Fast at least once annually. This was done on the Day of Atonement (Lev 16:29-31). This was a Fasting of contrition, which means coming before God, having remorse for one's sins, seeking His forgiveness, and pledging repentance, penance (following the requirements of the Law for atonement such as sacrifices of food or animal) and to not do them (sins) again. Today we are still called to fast, however we do not have to celebrate the Jewish holidays, but we are to celebrate Christ as our Lord!</p>
<h3>
Fasting in Bible Times
</h3>
<p>
The great O.T. leaders including Jesus, Moses, Elijah, all fasted for 40 days. <br> The Bible records that Fasting was not just for the super leaders, rather it was practised by most, such as during the Judges (Judges 20:26; 1 Kings 21:27).</p>
<p>
God's desire is for us to draw near to Him. He paves the way for our sanctification, but it is up to us to make that journey. Fasting is a tool and venue to help make it happen with real, authentic devotion and sacrifice <br>(Neh 9:1; Jer 36:9; Dan 9:3; Joel 2:12; Acts 27:9).</p>
<h3>
Don't Just Fast for Show
</h3>
<p>
Make sure your motives are right when we fast! Isaiah challenged the Jews, prior to their captivity, that their fasting was empty of purpose, pretentious, vain, and not pleasing to God, (Isa 58) just as Jesus does here.<br> Isaiah further expounded that because of their pious, fraudulent behaviour, they corrupted themselves, and that justice and virtue became absent in the land where God's love, and rule was to be shown to the world. Such decadence led to their seventy-year captivity under the Babylonians.</p>
<p>
Fasting can be used to do wrong, so remember our motives are crucial to honour God and develop our spiritual growth. The Pharisees, as well as their disciples, Fasted twice a week to prove their status and devotion to God before the public (Luke 18:12). However, God seeks the heart, and deeds done through sincerity and honesty, not for the purpose of self-promotion. <br>The Pharisees then added many more regulations on top of the Law. <br>In so doing they were trying to earn God's favour by ostentatious displays with no heartfelt meaning behind them.</p>
