For we know that if our earthly house, this tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. (2 Cor 5:1)</font></p>
<p>
To get the full impact of Paul's teaching here, the context must be understood. Paul had just been explaining why all his trials in life were just a "light affliction". It was because he had an eternal viewpoint. He saw physical life as just temporary, compared to the eternal life he had with the Lord. He illustrated this here by speaking of the temporariness of the physical body and life.</p>
<p>
The physical body is referred to as "our earthly house, this tent" The word "tent" is a metaphor used of the human body describing it as "tent" that is to be taken down at the point of death. Just as a tent is temporary and somewhat unstable, so Paul portrayed the physical, mortal body as a tent pitched temporarily upon this earth which will be replaced with an eternal one that will be permanent and last forever. </p>
<p>
In the following verses, Paul spoke of a new home, a "house made not with hands," a building of God, "eternal in the heavens." This was Paul's way of describing our spiritual bodies, prepared by God as our future, permanent dwellings. In the same way that a house of brick or stone is superior to a tent, so our glorified spiritual bodies will be infinitely superior to these physical bodies.</p>
<p>
Some people have mistakenly argued that Paul was sure that Christ would return during his lifetime. They cited passages like 1 Thess 4:15 where Paul used the word "we" to refer to those who were alive at the second coming of Christ. It might just as well be argued from this verse (2 Co 5:1) that Paul expected to die before Christ returned, because again he said "we."</p>
<p>
The fact is that Paul, like us, did not know when the Lord would return. Near the end of his life, God apparently showed him that he must die (2 Tim 4:6). Some believers have gotten into strange doctrines that deny the necessity of putting off the mortal body. They believe that if people had strong enough faith, they would never die. This is a doctrine that neither the Scriptures nor the apostles ever embraced (1 Cor 15:42-44 and Heb 9:27).</p>
<p>
This "building of God" that Paul was speaking of is our glorified spiritual bodies that we will receive at the resurrection of the dead. The phrase "not made with hands" means it is not man's doing but totally a work of God, which will last forever.</p>
<p>
Notice that Paul didn't state this as a possibility that some elite Christians might attain unto; it is guaranteed to all true followers of Christ.<p>

For we who are in this tent groan, being burdened, not because we want to be unclothed, but further clothed, that mortality may be swallowed up by life. (2 Cor 5:4)</font></p>
<p>
Living in the mortal flesh was a burden that Paul longed to do away with. However, Paul didn't just want to escape the physical body as some depressed, suicidal person would. The only reason he wanted to leave his mortal body was because of the infinitely greater blessing of his glorified body. That's what is meant by this phrase "not because we want to be unclothed,"</p>
<p>
Paul was living, in his mortal flesh, the abundant life that Jesus provided. However, he was well aware that this life at its best is inferior to the life we will have in our glorified bodies with Jesus.</p>
<p>
Those who wish to end this life just because of its problems and heartaches are like those who hate their clothing and therefore discard it. That leaves them naked, and that is not what Paul was saying. Instead, he was like those who have found better clothes that they are wanting to exchange their present clothing for. He was longing for his mortality to be swallowed up by the eternal life of God.</p>
<p>
Besides the mortal body referring to the physical body, which is liable to death, mortality also emphasises the weakness inherent within that body, which Paul referred to as <font color= "blue">"the law of sin which is in my members" (Rom 7:23)</font>. Victory over this power of sin is now possible through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit (2 Cor 5:5). Victory over the presence of sin will be possible when, as Paul stated, "mortality [will] be swallowed up of life" (brackets mine). <font color= "blue">But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you." (Rom 8:11)</font>.</p>
