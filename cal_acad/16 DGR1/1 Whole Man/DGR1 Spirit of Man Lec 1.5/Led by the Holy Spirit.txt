Led by the Holy Spirit
</h1>
<p>
What does it mean to be led by the Holy Spirit? Some may refer to it as being filled with ... or sensitive to ... or anointed by the Spirit. It probably sounds really spiritual. But being led by the Spirit is actually a very practical part of living the Christian life. Simply put, to be led by the Holy Spirit just means to be obedient to Him.</p>
<p>
The Holy Spirit does such awesome, yet practical work in the lives of God's children. He is our Comforter, Counsellor, Helper, Intercessor, Advocate, Strengthener and Standby. He teaches us and guides us into truth ... and He even brings the things we learn back to our remembrance as we need it.<br>
And the best part of it all is that He lives in each of us and that He enables us to be <font color= "blue">"... strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man," (Eph 3:16)</font></p>
<p>
He comes to live in our hearts when we're born again, and then He teaches and guides us according to God's plan and purpose for us. One of the ways He does this is by convicting us of the sins in our life. Much like a child does, as Christians, we learn what's right and wrong as we grow in our faith. We may get by with things that are not right for awhile, but the time comes when we need to grow. </p>
<p>
Now, I am immediately aware when I say or do something that is not pleasing to God. And this is what He wants for all His children: to develop sensitivity and obedience to His voice as He leads and guides each of our lives. <font color= "blue">"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God." (Rom 8:14)</font> This term "sons" indicates a level of maturity and intimacy in our relationship with Him.</p>
<p>
God is not looking for spiritual robots; He wants sons. He doesn't want us all just following a bunch of rules for the sake of obedience. In the Old Testament, we read about the Old Covenant, and there were all kinds of rules to follow and sacrifices to make for sin. However, under this covenant, the people's sins were only "covered" for awhile. In the New Covenant, which Jesus provided through His perfect sacrifice, our sin is completely washed away and removed from us. So we are free to obey God simply because we love Him and we know that everything He tells us to do, or not do, is for our good. It's no longer about a long list of rules and regulations; but following the Holy Spirit. We just need to learn to follow His lead.</p>
<p>
Now, everyone's story is different but the point is the Holy Spirit wants to lead us all according to the plans God has for each of our lives. I'm not saying it will always be easy. King David was called a man after God's heart, but we all know it wasn't because he did everything right. However, David had cultivated a passionate heart for God's will. He learned how to recover from his failures and move on in God, and because of that he earned the Lord's tribute: <font color= "blue">"... I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after My own heart, who will do all My will." (Acts 13:22)</font>.</p>
<p>
Our part is to pray, study God's Word, and learn to develop our own sensitivity and obedience to the Holy Spirit's lead. His promise to us is, <font color= "blue">"Then I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within them, and take the stony heart out of their flesh, and give them a heart of flesh,(Ezek 11:19)</font>.</p>

Trust the Holy Spirit in you ... He knows what's best. Let your adventure begin!</p>
