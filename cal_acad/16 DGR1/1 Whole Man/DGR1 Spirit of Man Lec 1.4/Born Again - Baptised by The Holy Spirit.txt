<h1>
Born Again-Baptised by The Holy Spirit
</h1>
<p>
But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptised, both men and women. (Acts 8:12)</p>
<h3>
Many were healed and delivered. 
</h3>
<p>
They were born again through repentance and faith in Christ, but it was obvious to Philip that something was missing in their experience. Under Philip’s ministry the believers were not baptised in the Spirit. So later, Peter and John came down that these Samaritan believers might receive the Holy Spirit as they ought to receive Him.</p>
 <p><font color= "blue">
Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them, who, when they had come down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit. For as yet He had fallen upon none of them. They had only been baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then they laid hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. (Acts 8:14-17)</font>.</p
<h3>
Power Released and Received 
</h3>
<p>
The power which the apostles released was so impressive that Simon the famous magician at that time wanted to buy the ability to release this power. Of course this was an evil and foolish desire. But he wanted to be able to impress people further with the same kind of power he was seeing accompany the reception of the Holy Spirit. The Scripture does not lead us to suppose that the reception of the Holy Spirit was some kind of quiet blessing.
Some point out that no record is made of speaking in tongues in this Biblical account. That doesn’t mean that it didn’t happen. Some early church writers said it did. But what we should learn from this account is that no matter how wonderful our salvation experience of turning to the Lord was, we should not be satisfied with that, but we should go on in God until we receive the Spirit in mighty demonstration and power.</p>
<h3>
Paul's Baptism in the Holy Spirit
</h3>
<p>
Further proof that the Baptism in the Holy Spirit does not always or even usually occur at the moment of repentance and faith can be seen in the life of Paul (formerly Saul). Saul met Jesus on the road to Damascus and confessed Him as Lord, which meant he was converted (Acts 9:3-8; Rom. 10:9). But God knew that was not all that Paul needed, Three days later, God had Ananias lay hands on Saul so that he would receive his sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.</font>

And Ananias went his way and entered the house; and laying his hands on him he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you came, has sent me that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit." (Acts 9:17) </font></p>
<p>
But did Paul speak in tongues then? Let Paul himself speak here. In writing to the Corinthians he said “I thank my God I speak with tongues more than you all;” (1 Cor 14:18). Not so much in church, of course, but outside the meetings in private so as to build himself up. In this way, his preaching was both understandable and powerful (1 Cor 14:19; 2:1-4).</p>
<h3>
Cornelius’ Baptism in the Holy Spirit
</h3>
<p>
Cornelius’ household and close friends were baptised in the Spirit at the moment of their conversion. How did Peter know this?</p> 
<p>
<font color= "blue">“For they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God.” (Acts 10:46)</font>. 
These people received the Holy Spirit just as the apostles (Acts 10:47). Peter realised that they were not only born again, but also baptised in the Holy Spirit, at that time.</p>
<p><font color= "blue"></font>
And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning. (Acts 11:15)</p>
Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptised with water; but ye shall be baptised with the Holy Ghost. (Acts 11:16)</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Why? “For they heard them speak with tongues and magnifying God” (Acts 10:46).</font> </p>
<p>
That settled the issue for Peter. In the Bible, the speaking in unknown tongues is a Biblical sign of the true New Testament baptism in the Holy Spirit. (Acts 2:4, Acts 19:6, Mark 16:17).</p>
<h3>
Speaking in Tongues
</h3>
<p>
And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. (Acts 2:4)</p>
<p>
And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spake with tongues, and prophesied. (Acts 19:6)</p>
<p>
Let us remember that God did not trust the writing of the New Testament to anyone who did not speak in tongues. And people who despise tongues because their churches don’t believe in it make the same kind of mistake as those in formal traditionalistic churches who reject the idea of regeneration by the Spirit at the moment of repentance and faith because it contradicts the long-held dogmas of the church. The Bible must settle the issue – not our traditions, theologies and lack of experience.</p>
<p> 
And the Bible says, “Desire earnestly to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak with tongues.” (1 Cor 14:39).</p>
<h3>
The Ephesian Believers 
</h3>
<p>
They were not true Christians in the full sense of the word when Paul met them. (Acts 19) They only knew the John’s baptism of repentance. They did not even know there was given a Holy Spirit. After Paul explained to them about Jesus “they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.” (Acts 19:5,6). </p>
<p>
Here we see that Paul was interested in these disciples’ relationship with the Holy Spirit. He showed them their need to be baptised in water and the Holy Spirit. Once again, speaking in tongues is revealed to have accompanied this initial outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the believers.</p>
<p>
To add to the testimony of the Scriptures, there are, scattered throughout church history, and especially now, there are many thousands and now tens of millions of people who have testified to having received this power from God some time after their initial conversion to Christ.</p>
<h3>
In Summary
</h3>
<p>
The Scripture shows that being born of God is not always happening at the same time as being baptised in the Spirit. The Scripture further shows that it is always desirable and God’s will for people to be filled with the Holy Spirit in such a way as to be clothed with the power of God and to speak with other tongues. (Eph 5:18; 1 Cor 14:5a).
And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; (Eph 5:18)
I would that ye all spake with tongues … (1 Cor 14:5)
All this and much more is promised to the believer who earnestly seeks a relationship of submission to the Word of God and to the Holy Spirit.</p>
