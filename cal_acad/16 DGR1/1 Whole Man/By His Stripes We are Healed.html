   <h1>
By His Stripes We are Healed
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
“He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed." (Isa 53:5)</font></p> 
<p><font color= "blue">
"who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness--by whose stripes you were healed." <br>(1 Peter 2:24) </font></p>
<p>
These stripes were administered by whipping the bare backs of prisoners whose hands and feet were bound, rendering them helpless. The phrase “by His stripes we are healed” refers to the punishment Jesus Christ suffered—floggings and beatings with fists that were followed by His agonising death on a cross—to take upon Himself all of the sins of all people who believe He is Lord and Saviour.<br> <font color= "blue">“I am the way, the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me” (John 14:6)</font>.</p>
<p>
The whips used were made of braided leather, with pottery shards and sharp stones affixed to the ends, which tore open the flesh of the prisoner with each cruel swing of the whip. When we picture this terrible, inhumane form of physical punishment we recoil in horror. Yet the physical pain and agony were not all Jesus suffered. He also had to undergo the mental anguish brought on by the wrath of His Father, who punished Him for the sinfulness of mankind—sin carried out in spite of God’s repeated warnings, sin that Jesus willingly took upon Himself. He paid the total price for all of our transgressions.</p>
<p>
In Isa 53 and 1 Peter 2:24, Jesus’ future life on earth was foretold in the clearest of terms, to include His eventual torture and death. <br>
Although these two verses are central to the topic of healing, they are often misunderstood and misapplied. The word “healed” as translated from both Hebrew and Greek, can mean either spiritual or physical healing.</p> 
<p>
However, the context of Isa 53 makes it clear it is referring to spiritual healing, not physical. <br> The verse 1 Peter 2:24 also refers to sin and righteousness, not sickness and disease.<br> Therefore, being “healed” in both these verses is speaking of being forgiven and saved, not being physically healed.</p>
