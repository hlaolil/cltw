Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers. (3 John 1:2)</font></p>
<h3>
Prospering the Soul
</h3>
<p>
I have been meditating on and contemplating this Scripture lately. I believe by and large Christians don’t have total understanding of what it means for our soul to prosper. It would be enlightening to understand what the soul is first before we go on. Many people say the spirit and the soul are the same thing, however the Word of God differentiates them.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. (Heb 4:12)</font></p>
<p>
If the soul and spirit were the same thing then why would there be a need to divide them as the Word of God is saying here? Meaning the thoughts and intentions of the heart are not the same as the thoughts and intentions of the soul. Since they are different and need to be divided, it would be beneficial for us to understand this and know why this needs to be so.</p>
<p>
What are the differences and why is it important for us to know the differences to have a prosperous soul as the Apostle John is saying. I believe it is critical for us to understand the difference. I believe it is vital in order to know when we are receiving something from God and when it is just our flesh. I know God is a Spirit and that He always communicates with our born again spirit, not our flesh, or mind or soul. I believe it begins with the Word of God, as the writer of Hebrews says. We have to start here. The Word of God is a divider of spirit and soul.</p>
<p>
The word heart is often synonymous with spirit in the Bible. It is not talking about the physical beating heart but our spirit. Jesus said this:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Jesus answered, "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. (John 3:5)</font></p>
<p>
We know He was not talking about physical birth, He specifically said born of spirit. It is the spirit of man that is born again. We know this because he goes on to explain:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
"Do not marvel that I said to you, `You must be born again.' (John 3:6-7)</font></p>
<p>
God’s Word tells us ... <font color= "blue">The spirit of a man is the lamp of the Lord, searching all the inner depths of his heart. (Prov 20:27)</font></p>
<p>
It is man’s spirit that communicates with God, and also where God communicates with us, not our intellect or emotions.<br>
So we can see that the spirit of man is born again of God. God’s life has been imparted to the one who acknowledges Jesus as Lord. So the question would be if the spirit of man is born of God, then what is the soul? Well, we know it is not the spirit and we know that it is not the flesh, so what is left? Everything else is left. Our emotions, our intellect, our thought processes, and our minds are all things that are not born again. Some would ask if we are born again then isn’t our soul born again too, isn’t our soul saved as well? That is a very good question and gets to the very heart of this discussion.</p>
<p>
The writer of Hebrews says this:<br>
<font color= "blue">
But we are not of those who draw back to perdition; but of those who believe to the saving of the soul. (Heb 10:39)</font><br>

The literal translations say preservation of the soul</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
James said this: Therefore lay aside all filthiness and overflow of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. (James 1:21)</font></p>
<p>
James was writing to believers, not the lost. He did not mean to save your spirit. Their spirits were already born again. He said the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. It is able to save your mind. Our minds or souls are not born again, they have to be renewed by the Word of God. This is a process that takes time, being born again happens instantly; the moment you acknowledge Jesus as Lord.</p>
<p>
James goes on to say, <font color= "blue">But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man observing his natural face in a mirror; for he observes himself, goes away, and immediately forgets what kind of man he was. But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does. (James 1:22-25)</font><br>

This is hearing and putting the Word of God into practice. This is part of the renewing process. Hear and put into practice.</p>
<p>
Paul said in Romans:<br>
<font color= "blue">
I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.
And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. (Rom 12:1-2)</font></p>
<br>
He here is talking about presenting your bodies and minds to God. Paul said be transformed by the renewing of your mind. James said receive with meekness the implanted Word which is able to save your soul. The implanted word will renew your mind and save your soul. They both said a similar thing about renewing restoring and saving the mind or soul.</p>
<p>
A similar word: <font color= "blue"> He restores my soul; He leads me in the paths of righteousness For His name's sake. (Psa 23:3)</font><br>

He restores my soul.<br>

We are born again of the spirit but our soul must be renewed with the Word of God.<br>

The mind will be dominated by the body if it is not first renewed by the Word of God.<br>

We will be dominated by the carnal not the spiritual without this renewing process.</p>
<p>
In order for your soul to prosper it must be dominated by your spirit. In order for your spirit to dominate your soul or mind, you must receive the implanted Word of God. This will save your soul. You may be saying I just don’t see this. All you do is have to look at any mental health institution. You will see people who have lost their soul. The world is full of people who no longer have control over their minds and have given it over to forces that now control them. Maybe this was not their original intention but it is the end state, none the less. I hope you see my point in this. Our minds must be renewed by the Word of God.</p>
<p>
In order to grow up into spiritual adulthood we must allow our spirit to dominate our mind and begin to walk the walk of faith. It can not happen any other way, and there are no short cuts in this process, only diligence in God’s Word. As the Apostle Paul said, this is our reasonable service.</p>
<p>
Only the renewed mind will dominate the body. The mind or soul will take sides with our spirit because we have renewed it with God’s Word.<br>
Your spirit by the power of the Holy Spirit will then and only then be able to dominate the carnal mind.</p>

I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service. 
And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. (Rom 12:1-2)</p>
<p>
The renewed mind is the beginning of this process, which is the salvation of our soul.</p>
