Definition of the Soul
</h1>
<h3>
Rational Faculty
</h3>
<p>
The way humans reflect the image of God is rationality. By God’s wisdom the world was founded (Jer 10:12) and creatures were created (Psa 19:24).<br> God’s wisdom is beyond that of human’s (Isa 55:8), but God still gave man/woman the ability to think and the capacity to be wise. <br>From the beginning (Gen 1: 26) God placed humans in charge of the earth, this not only was possible through power but also through wisdom. <br>Also, Adam was put in charge of naming all the animals (Gen 2:19), which shows the ability to think creatively. Throughout Scripture people are challenged to be wise, especially in Prov 1-9 and by Jesus in Matt 7. God gave man the ability to think logically and creatively, and the wisdom God desires most in a person is to follow His ways. 
<h3>
Emotional Faculty
</h3>
<p>
People are like God in that they have emotions. Passages throughout the Bible show us that God has a full range of emotions and emotionally laden traits. Compassion and anger (Ex 34:6), jealousy (Ex 20:5), patience (2 Peter 3:9), love (1 John 4:8), and rejoicing (Isa 62:5) are some of the things that God experiences. Likewise, humans before the fall experienced a full range of emotions. Gen 2:9 says that God made trees that were pleasing to the eye for man therefore man could experience pleasure. As well, when Adam was presented with Eve (Gen 2:23) Adam expressed pleasure. <br>After eating from the Tree of Good and Evil, but before God handed down the curse, Adam and Eve experienced shame and fear. Even if they experienced these because of their first sin, it does not prove that emotions are the result of the fall.</p>
<p> 
As Lewis and Demarest write, “Human emotions cannot simply have resulted from the Fall. Undoubtedly Adam and Eve experienced emotions in their unashamed relationships with each other and with God.” </p>
<p>
Beck and Demarest write, “Since humans were created by God to experience a wide range of emotions and feelings, we must not suppress feelings, as Stoic philosophers urged, nor eliminate desires, as Buddhism demands. </p>
<p>
It is apparent from Scripture that God does not relate to us unemotionally, nor we to Him unemotionally, nor we to each other. Humans find fulfilment as God-created emotions are properly expressed and negative emotions controlled.”  Persons are emotional beings.</p>
<h3>
Volitional Faculty
</h3>
<p>
Humans are volitional; they can make choices and pursue those choices. <br>This ability also reflects the nature of God. Obviously God has the freedom to choose what He wants, except sin, since He is perfect. <br>From the beginning, humankind also has been given the freedom to choose. Adam chooses to receive Eve (Gen 2:23), Eve chooses to eat the forbidden fruit (Gen 3:6); Adam chooses not to stop her and try some as well (Gen 3:6), and so on. Humans have always had the ability to choose and still do, though it is now impacted by fallenness. People are volitional beings.</p>
<h3>
Moral Faculty
</h3>
<p>
Humans are also moral beings in reflection of God being a moral entity. <br>Rom 1 drives home the point that humanity should know that there is a God and directly related to this knowledge should live accordingly, and a huge part of living accordingly is living morally. Of course, God is morally perfect, as is Christ. Humans were made “very good,” were given the ability to choose right and wrong, chose wrong by eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and then were morally bad or spiritually dead.  In summary, humans were given and can recover, through God’s help, the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, or between God’s ways and Satan’s ways, and then act in such ways. People are moral beings.</p>
<h3>
Relational Faculty
</h3>
<p>
Humans are relational. God created humans to be in relationship with Him and God recognised early that it was not good for man to be alone (Gen 2:18) so God made Eve for Adam. From the very first verses describing the relationship between man and woman, there is described a holistic intimacy.<br> <font color= "blue">“And Adam said: "This is now bone of my bones And flesh of my flesh; She shall be called Woman, Because she was taken out of Man."  Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.” (Gen 2:23-25)</font> <br>These verses point out multiple ways that man and woman were to be intimately connected. First, man and woman are of the same essence. Being of the same essence corresponds into the ability for there to be an incredible intimacy between persons, especially in the marriage relationship.</p>
<p>
Then, Gen 2:24 reveals that the relationship between man and woman (again particularly marriage) was to be the building block of society and that within this intimacy to be experienced by a man and woman there is a physical element. While “one flesh” may not mean only sexual intercourse, it definitely includes that element. This becoming “one flesh” highlights a couple of other significant factors in the intimacy between husband and wife. </p>
<p> First, it shows the difference between husband and wife. For them to join together physically, they obviously cannot be the same. Now, if becoming one flesh means more than just sexual intercourse, it also stands to reason that man and woman complement each other in other ways as well. </p>
<p> Second, we see the interdependency and deep connection man and woman have with each other. They leave the safety of the home and invest themselves totally in this new relationship. </p>
<p>
Then Gen 2:25 reveals that there was also an emotional connection. <br>“They felt no shame” makes the huge theological point about man and woman living in freedom from sin, guilt, and shame. It as well is a foreshadowing of the possible emotional impact that they can have on each other by being in relationship with each other. And to stretch this thought a little further, perhaps it could be said about the emotional impact that is possible by being “exposed” to each other. As well, there is not only the potential for Adam and Eve to have an emotional impact on one another, but also to have an impact on each other’s perceived identities. Before the fall they did not feel ashamed, after the fall they did. Ultimately the shame they had or didn’t have is due to the status of their relationship with God. It also appears,however, that Adam and Eve and therefore the rest of humankind can play a part in shaming others or themselves.  At this point in the garden the impact was good, but that was about to change with the fall.</p>
<p>
So far these introductory verses about the relationship between husband and wife say that though man and woman are different there is the potential for a very intimate connection that relies on their differences and similarities; the relationship of husband and wife is to be interdependent, the foundational relationship of society, which means leaving the family of origin; and has a great emotional component which can impact our perceived identity.</p>
<p> 
The next main point about the relational aspect of humans is from Gen 1:27 and Gen 2:23 primarily that man and woman are equal because they are both made in the imago Dei, that they complement each other, and that both male and female qualities better reflect the broader range of qualities of God. <br>  However, the researcher does not agree with the statement that man or woman is only fully human when in relation with each other. </p>
<p>
A couple of reasons why a person is fully human single are that Christ was single and was the perfect man, and Jesus (Matt 19: 12) and Paul (1 Cor 7:1) both affirmed singleness. However, just because a man does not have to have a wife or a woman a husband to be fully human, this does not mean a person does not need to be in relationship with others to fully express their humanity. <br>Part of the definition of being a person is being a relational being. <br>And theologians have convincingly argued that being made in the imago Dei partly means we reflect God’s relational nature as seen in the Trinity.</p>
<p>
God never intended that woman or man should live in isolation, but that she/he should be like God in his relational nature. God lives in relationship, in community, in the Trinity. We only fully bear His image in relationship. <br>The marital relationship is a uniquely intimate relationship, especially due to its sexual bonding. However man and woman can and should be in non-sexual intimate relations besides the marital relationship, especially within the body of believers. </p>
<p>
After discussing Jesus’ values on the family and how He raised the bar on values that protect the family, Cynthia Long Westfall has this to say (most likely with Luke 14:26 and Matt 12:50 in mind), “However, Jesus did not intend the family to be the most important institution on earth or the central unit of a Christian’s identity and purpose. He taught that kingdom relationships held a higher priority than family relationships and that His mission took precedence over familial demands and expectations.”  Whether one fully agrees with this statement or not, what one wants to draw out is the importance of kingdom relationships. </p>
<p>
A look at the relational aspect of woman/man reveals that persons are designed for relationship, are only completely human in relationship, and are powerfully impacted by relationship. As well, marriage, while not a necessity to be fully human, provides an especially intimate relationship. And finally, Christ placed high priority on kingdom relationships. People are relational beings.</p>
<h3>
Spiritual Faculty
</h3>
<p>
And finally, humans, like God, are spiritual beings. As important as the human body is scripturally, in itself it does not mirror the image of God, who is spirit. The human spirit, however, can manifest God’s likeness through the instrumentality of the body.  Meaning that there is a part of humans that is spirit that reflects God, while the fleshly body in itself does not.</p>
<p>
What does the Bible teach? A survey of Scripture shows that humans are referred to in terms of having a soul, spirit, heart, flesh, mind, and body.</p>
<p>
Beck and Demarest help clarify what Scripture is saying these terms mean about human make up, “Biblical usage, however, allows for identifying soul and spirit with the person’s inner life, and body with the outward material vessel.” <br> They are saying that the terms for spirit and soul can be and are used interchangeably in Scripture. Being made in God’s image makes us spirit/soul while being made as a creature makes us flesh.</p>
<p> 
Lewis and Demarest go on to describe the human spirit, “Like God’s spirit, human spirits are invisible, personal, indivisible, living, and active.” </p> 
<p>
So what is the soul? Again, turning to Beck and Demarest, “The soul/spirit is an immaterial, invisible, personal, living, active, everlasting substance, ego, self that thinks, wills, feels, distinguishes right from wrong, relates to oneself, others, and God, and whose identity endures beyond the grave.” <br> And finally about the functions they write, “Either “soul” or “spirit” may refer to the inner capacities such as thought, desire, or will.” </p>
<p>
The next conundrum that arises from this previous point is how the two interact, that is, the body and soul/spirit. This question could also be asked as how the brain and the mind interact, believing that the brain is of physical essence while the mind is of spiritual essence. </p>
<p>
Beck and Demarest write, “The material and immaterial (brain and mind, if you will) of the human being causally interact with each other ... The mind and brain are intimately connected in living persons; we have no experience with one acting alone without the other.”  So humans are made up of a soul/spirit and body and these interact and impact each other. People are spiritual beings.</p>
<h3>
Summary
</h3>
<p>
Some things learned from a look at biblical anthropology are:</p>
<p> 
1) Persons are created beings, dependent upon God, and find purpose in Him, </p>
<p> 2) Persons are made in the image of God which is a multifaceted identity &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;including emotional, volitional, moral, spiritual, and relational aspects,</p> 
<p> 3) Persons are made to be in intimate relationship with God and others, and the &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;marriage relationship is a uniquely intimate relationship, and,</p>
<p> 4) Persons are spiritual, have a body and a soul/mind that casually interact with &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;each other.</p>
