   <h1>
The Resurrected Body of Man
</h1>
<h3>
The Confession of the Christian Church
</h3>
<p>
First, the confession of the Christian church is instructive. The church has not only always affirmed the immortality of the resurrection body, but also its materiality. While it has agreed with the apostle that the resurrection body is a “spiritual” (i.e., spirit-directed) body (1 Cor 15:44), it has never denied that it is a material body.
<h3>
The Apostolic Testimony
</h3>
<p>
The Christian church has from the beginning confessed that the same physical body of flesh that was laid in Jesus’ tomb was raised immortal. <br>This belief is based on several explicit New Testament references and extensive tangible evidence.<br> 
Jesus Himself said His resurrection body was one of: <br><font color= "blue">“flesh and bones as you see I have” (Luke 24:39; cf. 13:37)</font>.<br> 
Speaking of the resurrection of Christ, Peter insisted that His:<br> <font color= "blue">“flesh did not see corruption” (Acts 2:31)</font>.<br> 
Writing after the Resurrection, John declared that Jesus: <br><font color= "blue"> ... has come in the flesh ...” (1 John 4:2; cf. 2 John 7)</font>. <br>
The body that emerged from the tomb on Easter morning was: <br>seen (Matt 28:17), heard (John 20:15-16), and even touched (Matt 28:9) on many occasions after the Resurrection.<br> Moreover, Jesus ate food at least four times after the Resurrection<br> (Luke 24:30; 24:42-43; John 21:12-13; Acts 1:4).<br> 
He also showed His crucifixion scars on two occasions, once challenging doubting Thomas:<br><font color= "blue"> "Reach your finger here, and look at My hands; and reach your hand here, and put it into My side. Do not be unbelieving, but believing." (John 20:27)</font>.</p>
<h3>
The “Ante-Nicene” Testimony
</h3>
<p>
Following the apostolic testimony, the church down through the centuries has confessed its belief in “the resurrection of the flesh” — both that of Jesus in particular and of humanity in general. “Ante-Nicene” (i.e., before the 325 A.D. Council of Nicea) Justin Martyr (A.D. 100-165) said plainly: “The resurrection is a resurrection of the flesh which dies.” As for those who “maintain that even Jesus Himself appeared only as spiritual, and not in flesh, but presented merely the appearance of flesh: these persons seek to rob the flesh of the promise.” Justin even insisted that Christ’s ascension shows that it is possible “for flesh to ascend into heaven.” </p>
<p>
Tertullian (c. A.D. 160-230) declared the resurrection of the flesh to be the church’s “rule of faith,” saying it “was taught by Christ” and only denied by heretics. </p>
<p>
In his treatise on “The Resurrection of the Dead” (chap. 3), second century Christian teacher Athenagoras concluded that God’s “power is sufficient for the raising of dead bodies, and is shown by the creation of these same bodies.<br> For if, when they did not exist, He made at their first formation the bodies of men, and their original elements, He will, when they are dissolved, in whatever manner that may take place, raise them again with equal ease: for this, too, is equally possible to Him.”</p>
<h3>
The “Post-Nicene” Testimony
</h3>
<p>
In the fourth century, The Second Creed of Epiphanius (A.D. 374) confessed that “the Word became flesh, ... the same suffered in the flesh; rose again; and went up to heaven in the same body; ... is coming in the same body in glory to judge the quick and the dead.” </p> 
<p>
Cyril of Jerusalem (A.D. 315-386) considered any view heretical that claims “the resurrection of the Saviour was phantom-wise, and not real, not heeding Paul who says, "Who was made flesh of the seed of David according to the flesh;" and again "By the resurrection of Jesus Christ our Lord from the dead.” </p>
<p>
The pre-eminent theologian, Augustine (A.D. 354-430), declared: “It is indubitable that the resurrection of Christ, and His ascension into heaven with the flesh in which He rose, is already preached and believed in the whole world.” Augustine even held that God would reassemble in the resurrection body “all the portions which have been consumed by beasts or fire, or have been dissolved into dust of ashes ... .”
<h3>
The Medieval Testimony
</h3>
<p>
Anselm of Canterbury (A.D. 1033-1109) insisted on the material nature of the resurrection body. Speaking on the topic, “How man will rise with the same body which he has in this world,” he argued that “if a man is to be perfectly restored, the restoration should make him such as he would have been had he never sinned ... . Therefore, as man, had he not sinned, was to have been transformed with the same body to an immortal state, so when he shall be restored, it must properly be with his own body as he lived in this world.” </p>
<p>
The great theologian, Thomas Aquinas (A.D. 1224-1274), said of the resurrection: “The soul does not take an airy or heavenly body, or a body of another organic constitution, but a human body composed of flesh and bones and the same members enjoyed at present.”</p>
