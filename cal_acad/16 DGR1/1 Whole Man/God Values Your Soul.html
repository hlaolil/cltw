   <h1>
God Values Your Soul
</h1>
<h3>
Why and How
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? (Mark 8:36)</font></p>
<p>
This is a question that every man, woman, boy, and girl should ask themselves. When we consider and understand that our life here is only a short span of years at the most, we should make preparations to live on with God after this earthly life is over.</p>
<p>
In reading God’s sacred Word, we find that there is only one way by which any soul can obtain eternal life with God, and that is through Jesus Christ, our Lord and Saviour. The Scripture declares,<font color= "blue">“Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.” (Acts 4:12)</font></p> 
<p>
God values your soul so highly that He gave His own Son to bear your sin and its penalty: to be reviled, defamed, cursed, put to shame and contempt, and slaughtered in crucifixion. What an immense price for your soul!</p>
<p>
It is written of Jesus by the prophet Isaiah, <font color= "blue">“He is despised and rejected by men, A Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. And we hid, as it were, our faces from Him; He was despised, and we did not esteem Him. Surely He has borne our griefs And carried our sorrows; Yet we esteemed Him stricken, Smitten by God, and afflicted. But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; The chastisement for our peace was upon Him, And by His stripes we are healed.” (Isa 53:3-5)</font> <br>
The immense suffering and humiliation that the Saviour underwent was not for any wrong that He had done, He <font color= "blue">“Who committed no sin, Nor was deceit found in His mouth";” (1 Peter 2:22)</font></p>
<p>
God, our Father, saw us in sin, lost and without any hope, and knew that the penalty attached to sin was death and destruction, misery, damnation, and eternal burning.<br>It is written,<font color= "blue"> “For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” <br>(John 3:16)</font></p>
<p>
We measure the value of a thing by what we are willing to pay for it, so we see that God places an immense value on our souls. He was willing that His only Son should suffer the awful outrage of wicked and sinful men, and be exposed to the ghastly treatment and bear the tortuous pains of one being crucified—the innocent, suffering for the guilty. The penalty of our sins was eternal death. <br>In order for us to be granted eternal life, the debt of our sins had to be paid in full. It took the blood of an innocent man to pay that debt. Jesus was the only innocent man to be found, for all others had sinned and come short of the glory of God (Heb 4:15; Rom 3:23).</p>
<p>
While receiving the Revelation, John wept when he saw us all in sin with no one found who could open the book of redemption and break its seals. <br>Surely, it was a serious thing and something that should cause great weeping. But John was soon comforted, <font color= "blue"> ... one of the elders said to me, "Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the scroll and to loose its seven seals.” (Rev 5:5)</font></p>
<p>
When Jesus Christ, the Son of God, suffered, bled, and died upon the cross, He opened the Book of Life to every soul. Now all who will believe can be freed from sin and death and have eternal life (Rev 22:17). The precious, innocent blood of the Lamb of God is the immense price that was paid for your soul by the God who loves you. That blood ransom, if believed in and received as an atonement for sin, will make the “vilest sinner clean” and innocent. When the precious Son of God was dying upon the cross, the Father looked down from heaven upon the scene and saw the innocent blood of His dear Son flowing freely.<br> Finally, the anguish, pain, and suffering ceased, and it was finished.<br> The Father was satisfied with the sacrifice that He had made for our sins, and the death sentence is cancelled to all who will believe and receive His blood as an atonement. <br><font color= "blue">“For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” (2 Cor 5:21)</font></p>
<p>
If you as a sinner will become genuinely sorry, and repent, ask forgiveness for the sins you have committed, and accept the blood sacrifice which Jesus offered for your sins, you will be covered by the blood of the Lamb. You will have made peace with God through the sacrifice made by the Lord Jesus Christ.<br> <font color= "blue">“Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord,.” (Acts 3:19)</font></p>
<p>
If souls could realise the extreme suffering and abuse that Jesus, an innocent Man, underwent to purchase their salvation, they would have to be hard-hearted indeed to reject such a Saviour and turn from their only hope of eternal life.</p>
<h3>
Crucified
</h3>
<p>
To give you some idea of what it means to be crucified, I shall quote from Farrar’s Life of Christ:</p>
<p>
It was unanimously considered the most horrible form of death. Among the Romans, the degradation was also a part of the infliction, and the punishment ... was only used in the case of the vilest criminals. The one to be crucified was stripped naked of all his clothes, and then followed the most awful moment of all. He was laid down upon the implement of torture. His arms were stretched along the cross-beams, and at the centre of the open palms the point of a huge iron nail was placed, which, by the blow of a mallet, was driven home into the wood. Then through either foot separately, or possibly through both feet together, as they were placed one over the other, another huge nail tore its way through the quivering flesh. Whether the sufferer was also bound to the cross we do not know; but, to prevent the hands and feet being torn away by the weight of the body, which could not “rest upon nothing but four great wounds,” there was, about the centre of the cross, a wooden projection strong enough to support, at least a human body, which soon became a weight of agony ... .<br>
And then the accursed tree—with its living human burden hanging upon it in helpless agony, and suffering fresh tortures as every movement irritated the fresh rents in hands and feet—was slowly heaved up by strong arms, and the end of it fixed firmly in a hole dug deep in the ground for that purpose. The feet were but a little raised above the earth. The victim was in full reach of every hand that might choose to strike... .
A death by crucifixion seems to include all that pain and death can have of the horrible and ghastly—dizziness, cramping, thirst, starvation, sleeplessness, traumatic fever, tetanus, publicity of shame, long continuance of torment, horror of anticipation, mortification of untended wounds—all intensified just up to the point at which they can be endured at all, but all stopping just short of the point which would give to the sufferer the relief of unconsciousness. The unnatural position made every movement painful; the lacerated veins and crushed tendons throbbed with incessant anguish; the wounds, inflamed by exposure, gradually gangrened; the arteries, especially of the head and stomach, became swollen and oppressed with surcharged blood; and, while each variety of misery went on gradually increasing, there was added to them the intolerable pang of a burning and a raging thirst... .<br>
Such was the death to which Christ was doomed.<br>
[Frederic W. Farrar; The Life of Christ, “The Crucifixion”] </p>
<h3>
Summary
</h3>
<p>
This is a description of the humiliation and intense suffering that Jesus went through because He loves your soul and wants you to be free from sin and have eternal life. Jesus is a true friend of the sinner. What more could you ask a friend to do to prove that he loved you? God values your soul so highly that He gave His Son as the price for your soul, and Jesus loves you so much that He willingly suffered for your redemption.<br> <font color= "blue">“But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” (Rom 5:8)</font></p>
<p>
God takes no pleasure in sending souls to hell, but has made a way for you to escape that awful place. He begs you to plead guilty of sin and ask forgiveness and accept the Blood as an atonement, by which you can have peace with God through faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Choose life, for eternal life is in His Blood.</p>
