  <h1>
Human Spirit, Soul and Body
</h1>
<p>
God gave spirit to man when He breathed into his nostrils the <font color= "blue">"breath of life." (Gen 2:7)</font>.</p>
<p>
Jesus said, <font color= "blue">"a spirit does not have flesh and bones." (Luke 24:39)</font>.</p> 
<p>
But James said, <font color= "blue">"the body without the spirit is dead." (James 2:26)</font>.<br> James also said God made the spirit <font color= "blue">"who dwells in us". (James 4:5)</font>. </p>
<p>
When the personal spirit of a person departs from the body of that person, life is gone from the body. The body of the person is said then to be "asleep" or "dead". (Acts 7:59; Eccl 12:7; John 11:11-14). Thus we see that a function of the spirit imparted to the human by God is to give life to the body and to dwell in and sustain life in that body until the body dies. </p>
<p><font color= "blue">
For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him?"  (1 Cor 2:11)</font>. said Paul.<br>This verse seems to indicate that the thoughts of a man, while known by that man's spirit, do not originate with his spirit. It is a function of a person's spirit to know, for some reason, the thoughts of that person. But, apparently, another part of the person generates the thoughts of that person.</p>
<p>
Every spirit is not from God, said John, but <font color= "blue">"every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God" (1 John 4:2)</font>.</p>
<p>
Here we are introduced to the fact that there are other spirits with us here on earth besides our own personal spirits and God's Holy Spirit. These other spirits are not from God. They will not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh. We must conclude that God intended that it be a function of one's personal spirit to confess Christ. </p>
<p>
If your personal spirit does confess Jesus Christ, <font color= "blue">"the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit." (Gal 6:18)</font>. </p>
<p>
Paul said,<font color= "blue"> "Let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit" <br>(2 Cor 7:1)</font>, indicating that the spirit can be defiled during this life.<br> All spirits are preserved by God until the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, some without blame, but some (those which are defiled and not cleansed) continue to have blame. (1 Thess 5:23).</p>
<p>
Within what context does the personal spirit of a person live and work during a person's life on earth, and how does the personal spirit become defiled? <br>Paul says <font color= "blue">"For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God. Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God," (1 Cor 2:11-12)</font></p>
<p>
We see here at least three types of spirits: spirits of men, the Spirit of God, and the spirit of the world. We must conclude that the spirit of a person can "receive" and be influenced either by the spirit of the world or by the Spirit of God. It follows that the personal spirit of a person which lives under the influence of the spirit of the world is not "without blame". But the personal spirit which lives under the influence of the Spirit of God has been cleansed and is "without blame."</p> 
<p>
James said,<font color= "blue"> "Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, "The Spirit who dwells in us yearns jealously"? (James 4:5)</font>.</p>
<p>
There is a clear intimation that some other spirit other than the Spirit of God can dwell in us and influence the lives of our personal spirits.</p>
<p>Perhaps James 4:5 is recalling <font color= "blue">"I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; ... I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, ..." (Ezek 36:26-27)</font></p>
<h3>
Being Influenced by God's Holy Spirit 
</h3>
<p>
Now we have a picture of man's spirit being influenced by two other spirits: God's Holy Spirit and the spirit of the world. As man grows up from childhood his spirit inevitably is introduced to and receives influence from the spirit of the world. But the only spirit which God desires to dwell in us with our own personal spirit is His Holy Spirit. Both these spirits, the spirit of the world and God's Holy Spirit, cannot dwell together with man's spirit in the temple of the body. <br>Thus, if the Spirit of God is to dwell in a person, it must be received as a new Spirit to completely replace the old spirit of the world. The spirit of the world must be thrown out before God's Holy Spirit can dwell in a person.</p>
<p>
Let John instruct us. <font color= "blue">"Now he who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. And by this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He has given us.. Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world. By this you know the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God, and every spirit that does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is the spirit of the Antichrist, which you have heard was coming, and is now already in the world. You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world. They are of the world. Therefore they speak as of the world, and the world hears them. We are of God. He who knows God hears us; he who is not of God does not hear us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error." (1 John 3:24-4:6)</font>.</p>
<p>
Men serve in their personal spirits either God, "the Spirit of truth," or they serve "they ... from the world," "the spirit of error".<br> Paul said, <font color= "blue">For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of His Son," (Rom 1:9)</font>.<br> We can be influenced by the Spirit of truth and serve God in our spirits.<br> Or we can be influenced by "they" of the world, and serve these spirits of the world in our spirits.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with Him." (1 Cor 6:17)</font>.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,." (Rom 8:16)</font>.</p> 
<p><font color= "blue">
For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, "Abba, Father."" (Rom 8:15)</font>.<p>
<h3> 
Being Influenced by the Spirit of the World
</h3>
<p>
Who are "they" from the world from whom John said we may receive a "spirit of error" and a "spirit of slavery"? Paul informs us that the Holy Spirit said "they" are "demons." <font color= "blue">"Now the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons," (1 Tim. 4:1)</font>.</p>
<p> 
John warns us about these demonic spirits in the Revelation. <br><font color= "blue">"And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs coming out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet. For they are spirits of demons, performing signs, which go out to the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty." (Rev. 16:13-14)</font>. </p>
<p>
Satan himself, and his great servants, the beast and the false prophet, are spoken of as demons who send out "unclean spirits." These "unclean spirits" try to enter into people to take the place that God desires His Holy Spirit to have in them. But God has instructed us all in the New Testament how to get rid of these "unclean spirits."</p>
<h3>
Under the Influenced of God's Holy Spirit
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught by Him, as the truth is in Jesus:  that you put off, concerning your former conduct, the old man which grows corrupt according to the deceitful lusts, and be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and that you put on the new man which was created according to God, in true righteousness and holiness." (Eph 4:21-24)</font>.</p>
<p>
Remember that the "likeness of God" is Spirit, for God is Spirit. When you have been renewed in the spirit of your mind, you will <font color= "blue">"have come to ... the general assembly and church of the first born who are enrolled in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the spirit of righteous men made perfect." <br>(Heb 12:22-23)</font>.</p>
<p>
Perhaps the most important function of a person's own unique spirit is that, within the person, it becomes united with God's Holy Spirit providing an avenue of communion from the person to the triune God. God intended that the unique personal spirit of a person become the "holy of holies" within the holy temple of the person's body where God's own Holy Spirit might dwell and where communion between the person and God's Holy Spirit might take place. <br>(1 Cor 6:17-20). </p>
<h3>
Under the Influenced the spirit of the World
</h3>
But the Scriptures indicate that the personal spirit of a person can be influenced to commune with evil spirits such as the "spirit of the world," the "spirit of the anti-Christ," the "spirit of slavery," or the deceitful and unclean "spirits of demons." Such communion, of course, will defile the personal spirit of the person and destroy any possibility of communion with God's Holy Spirit unless and until the personal spirit is cleansed, renewed, and again sanctified for the presence of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h3>
Cleansing Ourselves and Communing with the Holy Spirit
</h3>
<p>
We are assured that we can <font color= "blue">"cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of flesh and spirit." (2 Cor 7:1)</font>.</p>
<p> 
<font color= "blue">"And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness." (Rom 8:10)</font>.</p>
<p> 
Then, we can commune with God's Holy Spirit again and can <font color= "blue">"serve with my spirit in the gospel of His Son,". (Rom 1:9)</font>.</p>
<p>
Also, we can <font color= "blue">"worship the Father in spirit and truth;" (John 4:23) and </font>
<p><font color= "blue">
I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the understanding. I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with the understanding." (1 Cor 14:15)</font>.</p>
<p>
But note that these scriptures all show the spirit of a person communing and functioning under the control of another part of the person. We cleanse ourselves from all defilement of spirit. The defiled spirit is not cleansed until another part of the person takes action. We serve God in our spirits but other parts of us exert the will power and take the action resulting in service to God. We pray and sing with the spirit but obviously the prayers and songs must first occur in thought and may be expressed with some kind of body action, such as singing or praying aloud. Then the personal spirit does his part and prays and sings too, in a very special way and for a very special purpose, that of conveying our thoughts to the God Head.</p> 
<p>
Apparently, God intended that it be the spirit's function to know the thoughts, will, and actions of a person and to serve that person in his communications with God! <br>Indeed, <font color= "blue">"The one who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit with Him" <br>(1 Cor 6:17)</font>, and<br> <font color= "blue">
"The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God." (Rom 8:16)</font>. <br>Praise God! Our personal spirit can become one with the the Holy Spirit bearing witness to God the Father along with the witness of the Father's own Holy Spirit!</p>
<p>
But when Paul speaks of filthiness of spirit we know that we can defile our personal spirits. The thoughts, will, and actions of a person can defile that person's spirit. And, when Paul tells us that the spirit is alive because of righteousness, we know that without the righteousness imparted to us by God the personal spirit is "dead." We must conclude that a person's personal spirit which has not been cleansed from defilement is without righteousness and is not alive, therefore is "dead."</p> 
<p>
Here are revealed some very important concepts. One's personal spirit, given to each of us by God to impart and sustain life in one's body of flesh, while accomplishing that function, in some sense can be "dead." But, one's personal spirit can be "cleansed," made "holy" and can become "alive." While sustaining life in one's body, we conclude that one's spirit is controlled for better or worse by another part of one's triune being.</p>
<p>
Through God's sanctification, the "spirit" along with the "soul" and the "body" may be <font color= "blue">"preserved blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."<br> (1 Thess 5:23)</font>. </p>
<p>
And <font color= "blue">"that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus." (1 Cor 5:5)</font>.</p>
