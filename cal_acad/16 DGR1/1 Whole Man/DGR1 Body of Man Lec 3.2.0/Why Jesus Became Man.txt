<h1>
Why Jesus Became Man
</h1>
<p>
The great truth revealed in the New Testament is that the eternal God became one of us; He became a human being.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
And the word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth (John 1:14)</font>.</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul echoes John’s thoughts:<br>
<font color= "blue">
Who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bond servant, and coming in the likeness of men (Phil 2:6-7)</font>.</p>
<h3>
The Incarnation Of Jesus Christ
</h3>
<p>
God became a human in Jesus Christ. This is known as the “incarnation.” Incarnation is from the Latin meaning “in flesh.” Although it is not a biblical word it presents a biblical truth. Jesus is the eternal God who became flesh and blood. Jesus became a man at a point in time in history. He did so without giving up His oneness with God. He became a human being without a sin nature. “In flesh” means more than Jesus had a physical body – He was a complete human personality.</p>
<h3>
Jesus Took On A New Nature
</h3>
<p>
By the incarnation we do not mean that God was turned into a human or that Jesus ceased to be God while He was a man. The incarnation means that while remaining God, Jesus took upon a new nature – a human nature. The incarnation was the uniting the divine and the human into one being, one person. Jesus Christ was fully God and fully human.</p>
<h2 align="center">
Jesus Laid Aside His Heavenly Glory
</h2>
<p>
In becoming a human being Jesus laid aside His heavenly glory to live among us. The question is, why did He do it?  The Scriptures give us several reasons why Jesus came to earth.
<h3>
1. He Wanted To Further Reveal God To Humanity
</h3>
<p>
The first and foremost reason was to give a further revelation of God to humanity. If you wish to know what God is like you need go no further than to look at Jesus.<br> The Bible says.<br>
<font color= "blue">
No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him. (John 1:18)</font>.<br>

This verse teaches that Jesus explained God to humanity. We need no longer wonder what God is like; Jesus shows us.<br> 
Jesus Himself said.<br><font color= "blue">
"Have I been with you so long, and yet you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; so how can you say, "Show us the Father?”(John 14:9)</font>.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Jesus Did This By Both Words And Deeds</font></p>
<p>
Jesus claimed that God guided both His words and deeds.<br>
<font color= "blue">
Then Jesus answered and said to them, "Most assuredly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do; for whatever He does, the Son also does in like manner. For the Father loves the Son, and shows Him all things that He Himself does; and He will show Him greater works than these, that you may marvel.” (John 5:19-20)</font>.</p>
<p>
Jesus said:<br>
<font color= "blue">
"... but if I do, though you do not believe Me, believe the works, that you may know and believe that the Father is in Me, and I in Him." (John 10:38)</font>.<br>

Jesus’ work of reaching out to the vilest of sinners revealed the heart of God the Father. Those who criticised His work among the worst sinners revealed their lack of understanding with God’s desires.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
The Old Testament Revelation Is Incomplete</font></p>
<p>
While God revealed Himself to humankind in the Old Testament the revelation was incomplete. There were a number of things that waited till God Himself came to earth in the Person of Jesus Christ. Thus Jesus revealed God to humanity in a personal way.</p>
<h3>
2. Jesus Came To Fulfil God’s Promises To Certain People
</h3>
<p>
God made a number of promises to people like Adam, Noah, Abraham, and David.
<p><font size="+1">
Adam</font></p>
<p>
To Adam He was the promised Messiah – the seed of the woman.<br>
<font color= "blue">
And I will put enmity between you and the woman, And between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, And you shall bruise His heel. (Gen 3:15)</font>.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Abraham</font></p>
<p>
To Abraham Jesus was his one descendant who would bless the world.
<font color= "blue">
"I will bless those who bless you, and I will curse him who curses you; And in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed." (Gen 12:3).</font>.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
David</font></p>
<p>
To David Jesus was the promised King that would come from His family.<br>
<font color= "blue">
"When your days are fulfilled and you rest with your fathers, I will set up your seed after you, who will come from your body, and I will establish his kingdom. (2 Sam 7:12).</font>.</p>
<>p
The coming of Jesus fulfilled this promise. The angel said to Mary.<br>
<font color= "blue">
And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and shall call His name Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David. And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end." (Luke 1:31-33)</font>.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Jesus Came To Bring Salvation To All Humanity</font></p>
<p>
The covenants He made with them promised salvation for both Israel and the Gentiles. With the coming of Jesus to the world, these promises were fulfilled.<br>
<font color= "blue">
Now I say that Jesus Christ has become a servant to the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made to the fathers, and that the Gentiles might glorify God for His mercy, as it is written: "For this reason I will confess to You among the Gentiles, And sing to Your name." (Rom 15:8-9)</font></p>
<h3>
3. Jesus Came To Fulfil The Law Of Moses
</h3>
<p>
Jesus said:<br>
<font color= "blue">
"Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfil. For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled.” (Matt 5:17-18).</font></p><br>

By living a perfect life here upon the earth Jesus fulfilled the requirements of the Law in every respect.</p>
<>h3
4. Jesus Came To Die For The Sins Of The World
</h3>
<p>
When sin entered the world God instituted the concept of substitutionary sacrifice where God required the sacrifice to die. However the sacrifices of animals could not take away sin. Neither would the death of an ordinary human being be satisfactory to take away sin. What was needed was the perfect sacrifice. This was accomplished with God becoming a human being. Christ’s coming was to die on the cross for the sins of the world. When Christ came He sacrificed Himself on the cross at Calvary.<br>
Jesus Himself testified:<br>
<font color= "blue">
Just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many (Matt 20:28)</font>.<br>

His death on the cross has paid the penalty for ours sins. He died in our place so that we do not have to suffer eternally for our misdeeds.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
The Bible says</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the ministry of reconciliation ... For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. (2 Cor 5:19,21)</font>.<br>

Jesus Christ came into the world to become humanity’s Saviour. Without His coming humanity would not have a Saviour.</p>
<h3>
5.Jesus Came To Bring In A New Covenant
</h3>
<p>
Jesus not only fulfilled the promises of the old covenant, His coming brought a new covenant into existence.<br>
<font color= "blue">
While they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to his disciples, and said “Take and eat; this is my body.” Then he took the cup, gave thanks and gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you. For this is my blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins” (Matt 26:26-28)</font>.</p>
<h3>
6. Jesus Came To Destroy The Works Of The Devil
</h3>
<p>
His coming also was to destroy the works of the devil and the hold he has had over humanity.<br>
<font color= "blue">
For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil (1 John 3:8)</font>.</p>
<p>
Jesus’ death on the cross frees us from the power of sin. The devil no longer has any right to control us because Christ has given us the freedom to choose not to sin.</p>
<h3>
7.  Jesus Came To Judge The World Righteously
</h3>
Jesus came to be a righteous judge of humanity. Scripture says that it is He who will judge the world.<br>
<font color= "blue">
For the Father judges no one, but has committed all judgement to the Son, (John 5:22)</font>.</p>
<p>
Jesus also said<br>
<font color= "blue">
and has given Him authority to execute judgement also, because He is the Son of Man. (John 5:27))</font>.<br>

He is qualified to judge humanity because He became a human being. Since He has lived as a human being His judgement will always be righteous and fair.</p>
<h3>
8. Jesus Came To Sympathise With Believers As The Great High Priest
</h3>
<p>
Because Jesus, the God-man, lived here upon the earth and experienced the limitations of being a human being, He is able to sympathise with the problems and concerns that humans face. <br>
The Bible says:<br>
<font color= "blue">
Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. 15 For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin. 16 Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need. (Heb 4:14-16)</font>.</p>
<h3>
9. Jesus Came To Be An Example For Believers
</h3>
<p>
Jesus also came to provide an example for the believer on how to live one’s life. When a person puts his faith in Christ he has an example to follow. Jesus lived the perfect life as the perfect man with faith in His Father. Hence we are told,<font color= "blue"> “to walk just as He walked” (1 John 2:6)</font>.</p> 
<p>
Peter said:<br>
<font color= "blue"> 
For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps: (1 Peter 2:21)</font>.</p>
<p>
Jesus Christ provides the pattern of how believers should live.</p>
<h3>
10. Jesus Came To Prepare Humanity For A Heavenly Destiny
</h3>
<p>
Finally, Jesus came to earth to prepare humanity for their heavenly destiny. The Son of God became a human so that human beings could eventually be fitted with a new nature – a perfect one. One day we shall be like him.<br>
<font color= "blue">
Beloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is. (1 John 3:2)</font>.</p>
<p>
We shall have a body like His.<br>
<font color= "blue">
who will transform our lowly body that it may be conformed to His glorious body, according to the working by which He is able even to subdue all things to Himself. (Phil 3:21)</font>.<br>

Believers who have borne the image of the earthly man Adam will also bear the image of the heavenly man – Jesus.</p> 
<p>
Paul wrote:<br>
<font color= "blue">
The first man was of the earth, made of dust; the second Man is the Lord from heaven. As was the man of dust, so also are those who are made of dust; and as is the heavenly Man, so also are those who are heavenly. (1 Cor 15:47-48)</font>.<br>

The thing that hindered this from happening was sin.</p>
<h3>
Summary
</h3>
<p>
The incarnation means that the eternal God became a human being. When the Bible speaks about Jesus coming in the flesh it means that He had a complete, sinless human nature.</p>
<p>
The coming of Jesus Christ into the world was for the following reasons. Jesus came to provide a further revelation of God. The Old Testament was incomplete and the coming of Christ completed God’s revelation. Jesus also came to fulfil promises to individuals. The Old Testament records promises made to a number of individuals that were fulfilled in Jesus. Jesus also came to fulfil the Law of Moses – He perfectly kept the commandments of the Law. Jesus also came to be the sacrifice for the sins of the world. Because He lived a sinless life He could sacrifice Himself.</p> 
<p>
The coming of Christ not only fulfilled the old covenant, it also brought a new covenant into affect. Christ’s coming was also to destroy the works of the devil. Christ also became an example for believers. His perfect life sets the standard. Finally, Jesus coming has prepared the way for believers to receive their new body – one without sin.</p>
