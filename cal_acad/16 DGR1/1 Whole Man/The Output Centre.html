God's Wishes
</h3>
<p>
We are not vines who set our own paths and make up our own good works to please God - that is how the whole world outside of Christ believes because whether they realise it or not, that is following Satan's deception in the garden of Eden. Instead, Christians are branches of Christ. Just as a tree's sap feed the branches to bear good fruit, it is God who does good works through us by placing desires in us to accomplish all He wishes (which is always for your own good!).</p>
<p>
Those that reject Christ do not abide in Him. They are living their lives as if they were vines - when in reality they are branches not connected to the good "root" of the tree of God. And no matter how many "good things" they do in life, their sin remains and they wither, die and are collected out of the vine and burned as useless because they do not bear good fruit. (Remember "good fruit" is the fruit Christ bears through you.) So like Jesus said, you will know a person by the fruit they bear.</p>
<p>
Next question is ... What exactly is bad fruit and what is good fruit? The answer comes in Gal 5:19:</p>
<h3>
The Bad Fruit Of A Person ...
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. " (Gal 5:19-21)</font>
<h3>
The Good Fruit Of A Person ...
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law. <br>And those who are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live in the Spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another." (Gal 5:22-26)</font></p>
<h3>
Clean Inside ... Clean Outside
</h3>
<p>
The goal is to not make yourself look clean on the outside while we are full of sin inwardly, in our inner man and mind. We need to be clean inside and it will work it's way to your outward man. But we can't do this ourselves. We need Christ's forgiveness of sins so that the Holy Spirit can change us from within.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Do not let your adornment be merely outward—arranging the hair, wearing gold, or putting on fine apparel— rather let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in the sight of God." (1 Peter 3:3-4)</font>.</p>
<p>
God looks at us inside ... not outwardly. It is not what you do but the motives you have inside that He looks at. Your heart is the real you regardless what is outwardly. And we can align our own thinking to what the Holy Spirit is doing in us so that we will bear good fruit as we see in Phil 4</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy--meditate on these things.."  (Phil 4:8)</font></p>
<h3>
Rest in God.
</h3>
<p>
Allow Him to change you from the inside out, through the true vine ... Jesus Christ. And in time, you will bear the good fruit of God.<br>

See what promises God has made to those that accept Christ into their hearts and lives! You may just find out that what you have been told and taught by others (including pastors and priests) might not even line up to what the word of God actually says.  Read your bible! What's the worst that can happen? <br>Either way you find God's truth and the truth will set you free indeed!</p>
