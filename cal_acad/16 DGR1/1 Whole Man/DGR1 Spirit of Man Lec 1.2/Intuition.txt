Trust in the Lord with all your heart, And lean not on your own understanding; In all your ways acknowledge Him, And He shall direct your paths. (Prov 3:5-6)</font></p>
<p>
Throughout Proverbs one sees the reward of trusting in (lit. "clinging to," with the idea of setting one's hope and confidence upon) the Lord as opposed to the futility of resting in one's own wisdom and seeking one's own way. God designed His creation to have a dependency upon Him. Even the ordinary decisions of a day need the counsel 
of God, who instructs His creation to consult Him about even the most minute details, whether in the spiritual or secular realm. God promises to communicate in return. The Fall itself was precipitated when man sought to live independently of God, and this human independence continues at the heart of sinful rebellion today.</p>  
<h3>
Self-sufficiency and self-dependence 
</h3>
<p>
These have been the ruin of mankind ever since the fall of Adam. The grand sin of the human race is their continual endeavour to live independently of God, i. e., to ignore God in the things they do.<br> 
Entire trust in God is the only logical position for Christians to take. God has all knowledge and all power, and foresees and prepares against all the troubles that come upon man. For anyone to rely on his own understanding is foolish indeed. It is also folly to alternate between trust in self and trust in God. </p> 
<p>
If we are faithful to read God's Word, study it, meditate on it, and obey it, God will guide us when we have decisions to make. The Holy Spirit teaches us (John 14:26; 16:13-14) and directs us when we pray and seek the Lord's will. The Holy Spirit uses truth, not ignorance; so the more facts we have, the better. We should use our common sense but not lean on it (Prov 3:5-6), for we walk by faith and not 
by sight (2 Col 5:7). If we sincerely move in the wrong direction, the Lord will show us (Acts 16:6-10; Phil 3:15), so we need not fear. It is good for believers to read the Word and pray together as they seek the mind of the Lord. </p>
<p>
It is our responsibility to place ourselves in the Lord's hands, through surrender, through study of His Word, through fellowship with Him in prayer, through uniting ourselves with others who are like-minded. So begin, continue, and end every work, purpose, and device, with God. Earnestly pray for His direction at the commencement; look for His continual support in the progress; and so begin and continue 
that all may terminate in His glory:<br> 
Trusting God, relying or leaning upon Him, has the sense of putting your whole weight on Him, resting on and trusting in Him. When we have an important decision to make, we sometimes feel that we can't trust anyone--not even God. But God knows what is best for us. And he knows even better than we do what we really want. We must 
trust him completely in every choice we make. We should not omit careful thinking or belittle our God-given ability to reason; but we should not trust our own ideas to the exclusion of all others. We must not be wise in our own eyes. We should always be willing to listen to and be corrected by God's Word and wise counsellors. Bring your decisions to God in prayer, use the Bible as your guide, and follow God's 
leading. He will make your paths straight by both guiding and protecting you. </p> 
<p>
When we want God's direction, there are no halfway measures. There will be times when we slip back, stumble and sin. These times grow fewer as we seek and gain His direction. Progress comes when we place our full confidence, our will and intellect, in the Lord.  Does this mean God wants us to stop thinking, stop being individuals, 
become a robot? God forbid!  He doesn't expect us to short circuit our own mind.  He just tells us not to go to that understanding with the wrong assumptions.  It is simple.  Place your confidence in God, wholly, on a matter. (To do so, you will have to pray and search His Word to find out what it has to say on that matter.) This is putting our thoughts before the Lord and His Word. As we do this, He will give us the direction we need.  Decide today to pay due respect to God in all that is done.  He will direct decisions, judgements, and actions.  And we can count on growing in our walk with Him. </p>
<h3>
Abraham and Lot
</h3>
<p>
Abraham and his nephew, Lot, were wealthy and had vast herds of sheep and cattle.  But because the land was not able to support them both, and their herdsmen were quarrelling with each other, they decided to go separate ways.  Even though Abraham was older and had the right to make first choice, he allowed Lot to choose which part of the country to settle. 
Lot could have done a number of things in response to Abraham's generous offer.  He could have deferred to Abraham out of respect.  He could have asked Abraham's advice.  He could have taken time to think it over, or consult with God.  Instead, he impulsively chose the fertile plains of the Jordan River for himself (Gen 13:11) and sealed his fate.  By pitching his tents near Sodom, Lot came into contact 
with more trouble and more evil then he was prepared to handle.  He 
eventually fell captive to the king of Elam, and Abraham had to go and 
rescue him.</p>
<p> 
Many times in our recovery we will try to choose our life direction on our own.  We all  have the same tendency to go for the quick fix, the first thing that looks good, without taking time to consider our motives, our past history, and the potential consequences.  Lot's decision led him into many battles and situations that brought him much unnecessary sorrow.  Allowing God to direct his choice 
would have been much wiser.  But Lot had not learned to trust God as Abraham had.  His human nature overcome his spiritual desire to believe in God's loving direction. 
Our downfall comes when we fail to draw strength and wisdom from God and consult Him when making choices.  He wants to be there for us, to guide and direct us - if we will only let Him.</p>
<p>
The natural inclination in Christian living is to act on the impulse of a good idea. Not every good idea is from God. Sometimes good ideas get in the way of God ideas.  
Where does your inspiration come from? The vision of the transfigured Christ inspired Peter: <font color= "blue">"Then Peter ... said to Jesus, "Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You wish, let us make here three tabernacles: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." (Matt 17:4)</font>. Our natural impulse is to do something good for God and suggest it to Him.  The tendency of the well-meaning person is to prepare a plan to do some good idea, and then pray, "Jesus, this is my plan. It is a good plan. It hurts no one, and I want it to please You. Lord, please bless my plan." It is plan, then pray.</p>
<p>  
So many of our ideas are impetuous. They are not what the Lord wants to do. They do not resemble in any way the things which concern Him. We have good ideas, but they are not God ideas. His agenda and our agenda conflict. We want to build Him a shelter but that is not what He wants ... When Peter, James, and John heard the voice of the Lord ... they abandoned their inventive-but-self-made idea. The 
presence of the Lord magnified, and His holiness brought them to their senses. Jesus gained their attention, not by subduing them with a stem scolding, but by magnifying His presence until all the genius of their human ideas was bleached out by His very brightly shining face. 
When they abandoned their good idea and fell face down before the Lord, He could work with them again ... </p>
<p>
When you and I abandon our good idea and fall to our face before the Lord, then He will come and touch us, too. When we pursue our own plan He cannot use us. We must abandon our good idea and fall face down before Him. Then He will be able to use us again. Then He will reveal what He is doing - a God idea ... It is pray, then plan. Through prayer, Jesus instructs of His plan, a God idea. Prayer removes the impulse of the good idea, the good idea born of human ingenuity but not of God. Pray, then plan. It is the habit of the surrendered saint.</p>
