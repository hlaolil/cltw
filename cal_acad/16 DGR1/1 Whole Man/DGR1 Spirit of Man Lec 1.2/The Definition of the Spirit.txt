The Definition of the Spirit

Old Testament Spirit
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"But it is the spirit in man, the breath of the Almighty, that gives him understanding." (Job 32:8).</font></p>
<p>
So, according to the Word of God, human beings are not only flesh and blood but also have this spiritual component, or 'spirit essence.' Job also confirms for us that this was imparted with 'the breath of the Almighty.' This 'spirit' appears to be responsible for that particular mental/emotional aspect of human being and existence which is wholly immaterial: that is, this 'spirit' can never be 'counted,' 'added' or 'weighed up.' The origin of 'spirit' in the Latin, Hebrew and Greek languages always denotes: wind, breath, or, blowing. The Latin noun <i>'spiritus'</i> can describe vigour, breath, courage, as well as 'soul' or life. 'Soul', by the way, is a little more tricky; biblically it can refer to life or existence, as well as referring to Man's spirit essence; even so, 'soul' has generally been the preferred term among Christians for what we describe. But in the Old Testament, 'soul' is most often translated from <i>'nephesh,'</i> meaning 'life,' and does not necessarily tell us anything about the 'human spirit.' </p>
<p>
So 'spirit' essentially refers to the human properties of inner consciousness, intellect, emotion, motivation, thinking, planning, longing, and it empowers all such intellectual/mental/spiritual properties; We could do none of these things and have none of this inner mental/spiritual life but for that spirit of life (translated as <i>'nasham'</i> and <i>'ruach'</i> in the Hebrew, pneuma in the Greek), which the Lord breathed into the nostrils of the First Man (Genesis 2:7). That 'breath' which the Lord gave to the first couple comes from<i>'Nashamah'</i> meaning strong wind, blast, or inspiration. The Lord God had made Man differently to the animals because He had designed us to function 'in the image of God' so we have this divine spark, if you will, breathed into us by the Lord Himself. </p>
<p>
Animals just have 'life,' (Hebrew: <i>'nephesh'</i> first used of animals in Gen 1:20), yes that too is important and God-willed and grants every animal an independent living existence. It is not quite accurate to say (as some do) that animals cannot make choices. My cat (every single time) would prefer to lie on our bed and go to sleep rather than to go out if it is rainy outside. Oh yes, he is quite adept at making that particular decision! Yet he cannot plan for the future or enjoy listening to Bruckner's 8th symphony, or Dizzy Gillespie's trumpet playing as I do. Instinct is largely the order of the day, rather than intellect.</p>
<p>
So the spiritual area of human life (and even the poets have comprehended this) is that area concerned with feelings, emotions, anger, intellect, inner passion, enthusiasm, fear, turmoil and inspiration. None of this could ever be weighed up or counted - it is nothing to do with human flesh! So - it might be said - that something which those who believe in God (and to a lesser degree, even poets!), have always understood, is only now beginning to be unravelled and explained by scientists. Oh yes, even Aristotle and much later, Descartes knew that the human mind was immaterial, but science has largely been undecided!</p>
<p>
Yet the Old Testament never tells us too much about this 'spirit' essence which resides in every human being, and when it does, it often prefers to speak of the 'human heart.' This has always been seen purely poetically until - just literally - the last few years, when scientists have started to discover a very close relationship between the heart, mind and brain. Again, new knowledge to science - even when the Hebrews obviously already knew about this thousands of years before Christ! </p>
<h3>
New Testament Spirit
</h3>
<p>
But the New Testament starts to reveal to us that our 'human spirit' - vital though it is, is not enough. Every man woman and child ever born into this world has had this spirit. The need is to receive the gift of God's Holy Spirit which is available for truly meek God-believers who come to accept the Lord Jesus Christ as their Saviour. So just as the human spirit is 'divinely breathed' into the first humans in Gen 2:7, the Holy Spirit is 'divinely breathed' into the first disciples in John 20:22 revealing that true believers are really part of a New Creation. It appears that this true essence of the Holy Spirit joins Himself to our own human spirit in some wondrous way which we cannot hope to understand while still in the human flesh. Of course, we do not become perfect and we will still make many mistakes but, perhaps, the fogs and mists caused by human depravity start to clear even while we ourselves remain partly subject to that depravity in our physical bodies and lives.</p> 
<p>
The Holy Spirit starts to impart a small portion of the very mind of God into these true believers. From small beginnings, such people can, increasingly, then start to look at the problems of this world and see the true divine solution - yes, not only see it but become fully convinced that the divine solution is the only true solution and realise that - one day - a promised New Heavens and New Earth will make the divine standard the only standard in the entire universe.</p>
<p>
It is really quite strange how the unconverted and carnal mind (recipient of the 'human spirit' alone), looks at this world and sees millions of problems and wonders how they could ever be solved, but once that mind receives the Spirit of God, he or she immediately perceives that this world does not have millions of problems at all, but just one: sinful rebellion against God! When that issue becomes resolved, all human problems will vanish.</p>
