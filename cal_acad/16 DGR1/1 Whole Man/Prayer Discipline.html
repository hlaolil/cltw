Prayer Discipline
</h1>
<h3>
What is Prayer
</h3>
<p>
Prayer is the intimate pursuit and practice of the personal communication we have available between God and us. It is the spoken and unspoken confession of our Christian faith by engaging and proclaiming our complete dependence upon Christ as Lord over our lives. Prayer is not just a selfish wish list to get God to cater to our needs and whims; rather, it's true purpose and the reason it is also a discipline is to shape us by what He has revealed, and to grow in faith, character, perseverance, and maturity. Prayer is meant to line us up in Christ and to conform us to Him, so it builds us up in Him. It makes us willing and able to express praise, worship, seek forgiveness from God, become more sensitive, confess sins, make petitions for one another, and help others to be shaped, too.</p>
<h3>
Willingness and Desire
</h3>
<p>
Prayer acknowledges that we have a relationship with Jesus, and because of this, we are able to respond to Him. Further, we come to Him through the communication of discussion, learning, and our relationship building (as in His Word and Spirit). The Discipline of Prayer comes down to our willingness and desire. We must have a yearning and desire to commune with our Lord and Saviour. The Spirit persuades us to be yielded, and inspires us to respond and seek Christ out so He can mould us, indwell us, motivate us, empower us, and shape us to His will-inside and out (Psa 27:8). This requires us to see the importance of it, the duty we have to persevere in our faith, and the humility we are to put on (Psa 65:2; Luke 11:1-13; 18:1-14; Heb 11:6).<br> To make this discipline work, we must use our passion to pursue Christ more and ourselves less (John 3:30). The question is, are we willing to respond to His calling to seek Him further as He first sought us out?</p>
<h3>
Committing
</h3>
<p>
The Discipline of Prayer is committing to a two-way communication between God, our Creator, and us! This does not happen overnight. It may take years to develop this discipline to become second nature, automatic, and continual. Normally, for most Christians, prayer is intermittently used for occasions when we want something, when we have the time, when we schedule it, and so forth. The Discipline of Prayer is normally scheduled, but it is so much more; it is an attitude that we put into practice. We still should do our scheduled prayer times but not let that be the only time! We do this not to just maintain our relationship with Christ, but to empower it further, to build it, and pursue Him totally and continually in a reverent attitude of prayer!</p>
<h3>
How to Pray
</h3>
<p>
So, how do I pray? This is answered in Matt 6:9-13 or Luke 11:1-4, called the Lord's Prayer, which gives us the template as an instructional guide.<br> We do this as communication with purpose and effectiveness, as we would talk with anyone, and with the emphasis on our sincerity. Prayer is not about what we want; it is about growing close to God, for God looks first at our motivations. True prayer is not about the quantity of our words, but by the quality of our hearts, offered with a merciful spirit. Our prayers must be sincere, heartfelt, and real! The more time we spend in prayer, the more we will grow in our Christian formation. The point is to be sure we are not praying in circles with vain repetitions but with what is called brevity (brief and sincere), as we can cover more ground by focusing on praise for God and requests for others <br>(Matt 18:21-23; Col 1:15-23; 1 Thess 5:16-18; James 2:13).</p>
