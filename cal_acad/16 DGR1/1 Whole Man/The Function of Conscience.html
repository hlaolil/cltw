  <h1>
The Function of Conscience
</h1>
<p>
The definition of conscience is con - "together with," and science - "to know." It applies to that part of the mind that knows the motives, deeds and words of a person that no other but God can know.</p>
<p>
Conscience is not a guide. It cannot and does not tell the person who possesses it what is right and what is wrong. It's only function is to let its possessor know whether or not he is acting in harmony with what he believes to be right and wrong.
Often we hear the admonition: "Follow your conscience," which means they believe conscience tells one what is right and what is wrong. And if one believes a thing is right, it is right for him to do it. That is a lie! It is the heart of humanism. The devil invented no greater deception than to make one believe he is right if he thinks he is right.</p>
<p>
Conscience can not be a guide for anything because that is not its function.<br> Conscience cannot be a safe guide for anyone because:<br>
It would have to be infallible. The only safe and reliable guide in spiritual things, with one's eternal destiny in the balance, is the infallible word of God. It is not the function of conscience to guide. Without knowledge of right and wrong, conscience is paralysed.</p>
<p>
The inspired apostle Paul said he persecuted the way of Christ, putting both men and women in prison for serving the Lord (Acts 22:4). Before king Agrippa he said, <font color= "blue">"Indeed, I myself thought I must do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth." (Acts 26:9)</font>. He said, <font color= "blue">"Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day" (Acts 23:1)</font>. He said he did many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth, including persecuting Christians, even consenting to their death, and at the time he thought he ought to do these things. He was acting in good conscience, but he was fighting against Jesus Christ by trying to destroy his word and work. He did this with a good conscience. Paul said he <font color= "blue">"was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insolent man; but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief" (1 Tim 1:13)</font>.</p>
<p>
Some thought they were right when they were wrong. <font color= "blue">"There is a way that seems right to a man, But its end is the way of death" (Prov 16:25)</font>. The man who thinks he is going in the right way has a good conscience, but this verse says it may be the ways of death. Paul <font color= "blue">"made havoc of the church, entering every house, and dragging off men and women, committing them to prison." (Acts 8:3)</font>. He knew the truth only when the Jesus appeared to him on the road to Damascus (Acts 9:4). At that point he had knowledge that Jesus was the Son of God, and to follow his former course, he would have had a guilty conscience. </p>
<p>
The apostle described his conviction before he knew that Christ was the Son of God. <font color= "blue">"For you have heard of my former conduct in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God beyond measure and tried to destroy it. And I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries in my own nation, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers." (Gal 1:13-14)</font>. While he was doing this he thought he was doing the will of God (Acts 26:9). He had a good conscience (Acts 23:1), but he said he was persecuting the church "beyond measure." He said <font color= "blue">"I myself always strive to have a conscience without offence toward God and men" (Acts 24:16)</font>. But he did it ignorantly in unbelief (1 Tim. 1:13). </p>
<p>
If conscience is a guide, religious people are hopelessly divided because of their consciences. The unity of the faith once delivered to the saints is useless. People are making their consciences their guides, and people have different consciences. How can we say anyone is wrong about anything unless we can know that he did not have a good conscience? At the time the apostle Paul said he persecuted the church of the Lord, and did many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth, he said he had a good conscience. If conscience is a safe guide, he was doing right because he said he had a conscience void of offence toward God and all men. Was his conduct right? The warring creeds of religious people speaks loudly for the failure of conscience as a guide.</p> 
<p>
If conscience is a safe and reliable guide, why did some have to change? Paul said he obtained mercy because he persecuted Christ and the church. He changed. Why? He said he did it ignorantly in unbelief, and he thought he ought to do these things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth, yet he said he had a good conscience, void of offence toward God and men; a pure conscience, yet he was wrong and had to change to please God. I have studied the New Testament with many who began the study believing they were right.</p>
<h3>
What is the function of conscience
</h3>
<p>
To "bear witness together" is to have two to bear witness to the same thing: one's conscience bears witness with his spirit that something is true.<font color= "blue"> "I tell the truth in Christ, I am not lying, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Spirit," (Rom 9:1)</font>. Just as <font color= "blue">"The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God" (Rom 8:16)</font>; we bear witness to self (Rom 2:12-15). </p>
<p>
The conscience sits in judgement on one's heart and conduct in harmony with his knowledge of right and wrong. (1 Cor 8:7-11; 10:25-29).</p> 
<p>
The conscience accuses or excuses one of his motives, thinking, conduct and words; and it convicts him in wrong doing based upon his understanding of right and wrong. <font color= "blue">"who show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and between themselves their thoughts accusing or else excusing them" (Rom 2:15)</font>.</p>
<p><font color= "blue"Then those who heard it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning with the oldest even to the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst." (John 8:9)"></font>.
The conscience commends or defends one (Rom 2:15).
<h3>
There Are Different States of Conscience
</h3>
<p>
One may have a good conscience. <font color= "blue">"Then Paul, looking earnestly at the council, said, "Men and brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day." (Acts 23:1)</font>.</p> 
<p><font color= "blue">
"Now the purpose of the commandment is love from a pure heart, from a good conscience, and from sincere faith" (1 Tim 1:5)</font>.<br> 
<font color= "blue">"having faith and a good conscience, which some having rejected, concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck," (1 Tim. 1:19)</font>. </p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"having a good conscience, that when they defame you as evildoers, those who revile your good conduct in Christ may be ashamed." (1 Pet 3:16)</font>.<br> 
<font color= "blue">"There is also an antitype which now saves us--baptism (not the removal of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God), through the resurrection of Jesus Christ," (1 Pet 3:21)</font>.</p> 
<p><font color= "blue">
"Pray for us: for we are confident that we have a good conscience, in all things desiring to live honestly" (Heb 13:18)</font>. </p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"This being so, I myself always strive to have a conscience without offence toward God and men" (Acts 24:16)</font>.</p> 
<p><font color= "blue">
"Holding the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience" (1 Tim. 3:9)</font>.</p>
<p>
One may have a weak conscience (1 Cor 8:10-12).</p>
<p>
One may have a defiled conscience (1 Cor 8:7; Tit 1:15).</p>
<p>
One may have a seared conscience (1 Tim 4:1-2).</p>
<p>
One may have an evil conscience (Heb 10:22; 6:6).</p>
<h3>
How to Use Conscience
</h3>
<p>
No one can escape his conscience as long as it functions, but if he destroys his conscience, he will have no breaks when temptations attack.</p>
<p>
One may destroy his conscience when he continually violates it in his motives, speech and conduct. He will "sear" his conscience until it no longer urges him to resist the evil he knows. It works just as the brake linings on a car. Start down hill full speed with your foot on the gas peddle and on the brakes at the same time and keep on going. By the time you reach the bottom the brakes are burned so that they will not hold. The brakes are gone; they will not stop the car any longer. That is what happens to one whose conscience is seared; he has no inner restraint to wrong doing, or urge to do what he knows is right. His conscience is destroyed.</p>
<p>
Wilful ignorance tends to destroy the conscience.<font color= "blue"> "Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent," (Acts 17:30)</font>.</p> 
<p>
"For this they wilfully forget: that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of water and in the water," (2 Pet 3:5). </p>
<p>
Men do many things in ignorance, but when one can know better and should know better, but will not make the effort, he is willingly ignorant. Such a person will destroy his conscience in time by trying to avoid knowing right and wrong in his life.  One who continually makes excuses for not doing what he knows to be right will in time destroy his conscience</p>
<p>
Violating one's conscience is akin to suicide. "I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself: but to him that esteemeth any thing to be unclean, to him it is unclean" (Rom. 14:14). "But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because he does not eat from faith; for whatever is not from faith is sin." (Rom 14:23).</p>
<h3>
We Must Respect Our Conscience
</h3>
<p>
That is not the same as "obeying" or "following" our conscience, because that is not its function to guide or lead us in our choices in life. That is the function of intellect, emotion and volition. One's conscience simply and only accuses or excuses him/her when he/she responds in thought, word or action to what he/she knows is right or wrong, and they make the choice to think, act or speak.</p>
<p>
Obedience to the faith as one knows it will produce a good conscience.<font color= "blue"> "Now the purpose of the commandment is love from a pure heart, from a good conscience, and from sincere faith," (1 Tim 1:5</font>).</p> 
<p><font color= "blue">
"Therefore you must be subject, not only because of wrath but also for conscience sake." (Rom 13:5)</font>. </p>
<p>
One with a guilty conscience is miserable, until he "sears" or destroys his conscience. Judas is an example of what happens when one overrules their conscience. He knew better, and was told he would betray Jesus to be put to death. When the opportunity came, he willingly did what he knew to be wrong. <font color= "blue">"Then Judas, His betrayer, seeing that He had been condemned, was remorseful and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." And they said, "What is that to us? You see to it!" (Matt 27:3-4)</font>.</p> 
<p>
The governor Felix heard the gospel, but did nothing about it. "And after some days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ. Now as he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgement to come, Felix was afraid and answered, "Go away for now; when I have a convenient time I will call for you." (Acts 24:24-25).</p>
<h3>
How to Obtain a Good Conscience
</h3>
<p>
Men and women are made pure and clean from their sins by the blood of Christ. That is the only way to have sins forgiven forever. <font color= "blue">"how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?" (Heb 9:14)</font>.<br> 
<font color= "blue">"For then would they not have ceased to be offered? For the worshippers, once purified, would have had no more consciousness of sins." (Heb 10:2)</font>. </p>
<h3>
Faith and baptism
</h3>
<p>
The first and last conditions stated in the gospel of Christ for the remission of sins, are necessary to have a good conscience before God. <font color= "blue">"let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water." (Heb 10:22)</font>.</p> 
<p><font color= "blue">
"There is also an antitype which now saves us--baptism (not the removal of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God), through the resurrection of Jesus Christ," (1 Pet 3:21)</font>.</p>
