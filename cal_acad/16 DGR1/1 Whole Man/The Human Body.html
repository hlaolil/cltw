The Human Body
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
I will praise You, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made; Marvellous are Your works, and that my soul knows very well. (Psa 139:14)</font></p>
<p>
The brain itself cannot feel pain. While the brain might be the pain centre when you cut your finger or burn yourself, the brain itself does not have pain receptors.</p>
<p>
Your left lung is smaller than your right lung to make room for your heart.</p>

<p>The average human produces 1.1 litres of saliva a day or 454000 litres in a lifetime.</p>

<p>In one hour, your heart works hard enough to produce the equivalent energy to raise almost 1 ton of mass 1 m off the ground.</p>

<p>Scientists say the higher your I.Q. the more you dream.</p>

<p>The average human's heart will beat 3000 million times in their lifetime.</p>

<p>There are 72 km of nerves in the skin of a human being.</p>

<p>A full bladder is roughly the size of a soft ball (305 mm in circumference).</p>

<p>Your brain operates on the same amount of power that would light a 10-watt light bulb.</p>

<p>There are 5 million hair follicles on an average adult.</p>

<p>The acid in your stomach is strong enough to dissolve razorblades.</p>

<p>The human brain cell can hold 5 times as much information as the Encyclopaedia Britannica.</p>

<p>Approximately 75% of human faeces is made of water.</p>

<p>Science agrees that the eye is far too complex to have evolved.</p>

<p>Your eyes are always the same size from birth but your nose and ears never stop growing.</p>

<p>The average human dream lasts 2-3 seconds.</p>

<p>Your brain is more active during the night than the day.</p>

<p>Human thigh bones are stronger than concrete.</p>

<p>The tooth is the only part of the human body that can't repair itself.</p>

<p>An average human loses about 200 head hairs per day.</p>

<p>The white part of your fingernail is called the Lunula.</p>

<p>Fingernails grow nearly 4 times faster than toenails.</p>

<p>Your thumb is approximately the same size as your nose.</p>

<p>A woman's heart beats faster than a man's.</p>

<p>It only takes 3.1 kg of pressure to rip off your ears.</p>

<p>There are nine muscles in your ear.</p>

<p>Your nose can remember 50,000 different scents.</p>

<p>If the average male never shaved, his beard would be 3.9 m long when he died.</p>

<p>Nerve impulses to and from the brain travel as fast as 273 km per hour.</p>

<p>There are about one trillion bacteria on each of your feet.</p>

<p>There are no two tongue prints that are alike.</p>

<p>Injured fingernails grow faster than uninjured ones.</p>

<p>Women blink twice as much as men.</p>

<p>Most people blink about 25 times a minute.</p>

<p>When you are looking at someone you love, your pupils dilate, they do the same when you are looking at someone you hate.</p>

<p>Your body gives off enough heat in 30 minutes to bring 2.0 litres of water to a boil.</p>

<p>Blondes have more hair than dark-haired people.</p>

<p>The largest internal organ is the small intestine. The small intestine is four times as long as the average adult is tall.</p>

<p>Facial hair grows faster than any other hair on the body.</p>

<p>Bone is stronger than the steel (for every 25mm) used in skyscrapers.</p>

<p>About one third of the human race has 20-20 vision.</p>

<p>The enamel in your teeth is the hardest substance in your body.</p>

<p>Your teeth start growing 6 months before you are born.</p>

<p>You're ears secrete more earwax when you are afraid than when you aren't.</p>

<p>Your body uses 300 muscles to balance itself when you are standing still.</p>

<p>The average woman is 127 mm shorter than the average man.</p>

<p>The ashes of a cremated person average about 4.0 kg. A big part of what gives the human body weight is the water trapped in our cells.</p>
<p>
After reading these few facts about the human body, listed above, we can only agree with Psa 139:14 that our Lord is marvellous!
