Renewing the Soul
</h1>
<h3>
In Need of Restoration?
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“He restores my soul ... (Psa 23:3)”</font></p>
<p>
Why is this declaration from one of the most famous Psalms in the Bible so encouraging and relevant to you today?<br>

To understand, one must know what the soul consists of that needs restoration.  The soul is your mind, your will, and your emotions.  If your soul is wounded, damaged, and hurting, then you are in need of some help.  You make mistakes and you are tormented by replays in your mind.  Regret, shame, or frustrations plague your emotions.  You will to do right, but you always seem to do the wrong that you willed not to do; you need God’s will to help you do right. <br> You are having relationship problems and cannot sleep at night because of what they said or did or feel you should be doing.  Your soul is in need of restoration.<br> Only God can renew your mind, calm your emotions, and help you to will to do things His way.  You saw things and did things that you are not proud of and you feel ruined in your mind; you are not the person you used to be or want to be. (see Rom 12:2)</p>
<h3>
There is Hope  
</h3>
<p>
God does not just detoxify your soul but He restores it like new! A restoration of the soul brings back purity; it brings you back to your original condition.<br>When God restores, He doesn’t just piece you back together to make you look like something you are not.</p>
<p>
Ask God to restore your soul today and experience clarity, peace, and freedom like you’ve never had before.  He will give you a renewed mind, you can replace your crazy emotions with His peace, and He can replace your stubborn will with a willing heart.</p>
