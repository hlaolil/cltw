Faith Can Grow Like a Seed  
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
"I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain.” (John 12:24)</font></p>
<p>
What does a farmer do when he’s got a barren field that’s producing no income? He doesn’t complain about it. He doesn’t even pray about it! He just goes out and starts planting some seed, because nothing is going to happen until he plants the seed. He can pray all he wants, but it’s not going to produce fruit. He’s got to plant some seed.</p>
<p>
Some of you think you’re waiting on God. You think you’re waiting on God for that job. You think you’re waiting on God for a husband. You think you’re waiting on God for the windfall. God says, “You think you’re waiting on me?<br>I’m waiting on you! I’m waiting for you to plant a seed.”</p>
<p>
Everything in life starts as a seed — a relationship, a marriage, a business, a church. And nothing happens until the seed is planted.</p>
<p>
Why does God require us to plant a seed? Because planting is an act of faith. You take what you’ve got, and you give it away. That takes an act of faith!<br>And it brings glory to God.</p>
<p>
Jesus described this principle of sowing and reaping when He was trying to explain why He came to Earth to die on the cross.<br> Jesus said, “unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain” (John 12:24). <br>Jesus was saying, “Millions of people will be saved and go to Heaven because of My death and Resurrection. I’m going to plant a seed, and the seed is going to be My life.”</p>
<p>
Here’s the principle of sowing and reaping: Whenever you have a need, you plant a seed. Whatever it is you need — more time, more energy, more money, more support, more relationships, more wisdom — just plant a seed.<br> If you need more time, give more time to your kids. If you need more money, give it away to someone who needs it. If you need more wisdom, share what wisdom you have with others. Give yourself away!</p>
<p>
It may not make sense to you to give away something that you need more of, but that is exactly the kind of attitude that God wants to bless and that will produce fruit in your life. When you have a need, don’t gripe about it, don’t wish about it, and you don’t even have to pray about it — just plant a seed!</p>
