The Principle of Submission
</h1>
<h3>
Submission 
</h3>
<p>
This means having the willingness to voluntarily submit to Christ and also to others in authority. Thus, we make a commitment and resolve to yield our will, mind, and body for God's purposes so we can better hear, receive, and obey His Word. It is a call to submit and a Discipline because it takes our effort, even though we are not required to do so. When we are submitting to others, we are also submitting and serving Christ as Lord (Col 3:23-24)! It is an aspect of the surrender of our lives to God so we are in His will.</p> 
<p>
Because Submission is respect, it is not to exceed the parameters of the will of God or of love and righteousness. This Discipline of Submission is more about our interpersonal relationships and how we humbly reverence God, whereas Surrender is how we should come before God. The application is for our benefit. In our churches, when we are under the leadership of those who are more mature and respect others leadership, we will learn and grow more. <br>In so doing we will become a better, healthier church. This will also affect our home life and relationships as we will show love and respect thus creating harmony and contentment.</p>
<h3>
What Submission is Not
</h3>
<p>
It is not a loss of our identity or personality; rather, we are freed and enhanced to be better and more content with God and others. Submission is not about hating ourselves; rather, it means to have a right respect and relationship with God. The Bible calls us to also love ourselves, because we can't love others as we love ourselves unless we respect and love ourselves! But, this does not mean having pride or placing ourselves always on top or having to have it our way-period (Mark 12:30-31)! </p>
<p>
In contrast, arrogance lifts our self-interest and self-sufficiency, which may seem necessary and good. However, when we are self-sufficient or self-indulgent, we not only fail to see our need for redemption, but also fail to see our need for growth in spiritual matters. Therefore, self becomes the god, and any work of the One True God is muted and put aside. This means we are not to base our identity on who we are in society or in wealth or anything outside of who we are in Christ, our love, and Christian maturity and growth.</p> 
<p>
This is not being "weak;" rather, it is being "meek," as Christ exemplified and called us to be. Meekness is showing humbleness and gentleness toward God and others <br>(Ex 32:19-20; 30-34; Num 12:1-3; Psa 37:11; Prov 3:5; Matt 5: 3-12; 11:29). Meekness causes us to seek to please God and submit our will and aspirations to His will and what is best. This will enable us to endure being personally attacked as we keep our focus on Christ and humility.</p>
<h3>
If We Do Not Submit 
</h3>
<p>
We will have a disregard for unity and no respect for authority; thus, our sinful nature will win out. The result will be quarrels (because of pride), discord (because of a battle of wills with one another instead of love and Fruit), and shame, bringing the destruction of our church, our families, and our relationships. We will become imprisoned in our own agendas and hurts so the wonder of relationships and the sweetness of His work are not received by us. We will become consumed with our anger that results in bitterness and strife with others. We will become ingrates and our hurt, which is mostly self-inflicted, will become a weapon to hurt and destroy others instead of building and growing with them in God. </p>
<h3>
Our Minds Focused on Jesus
</h3>
<p>
When our minds are focused on Christ and not on status, situations, possessions, or experiences, we will glorify Him. Then, we do not need to worry, fret, or become consumed with anger, bitterness, or ingratitude when others come against us. Thus, if our situation is bad, or we do not get our way, we can still succeed and be joyful. And when we are doing well, we will not let pride rule over us either. This comes about when we realise that Jesus does indeed care, and loves us ever so deeply!</p>
