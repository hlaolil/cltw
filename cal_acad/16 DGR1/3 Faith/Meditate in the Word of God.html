Meditate in the Word of God
</h1>
<h3>
Meditation
</h3>
<p>
This is what will strengthen our faith and courage: attention to God's word.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Oh, how I love Your law! It is my meditation all the day. You, through Your commandments, make me wiser than my enemies; (Psa 119:97-98)</p>
<p>How sweet are Your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth!<br>(Psa 119:103),</p> 
<p>Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path" (Psa 119:105)</font></p>
<p>We learn wisdom from God as we meditate on His word.</p>
<p>
What does it mean to meditate? Do we assume a lotus position and hum?<br> Do we erase all thoughts from our mind and try to merge our thoughts with the Great Beyond? No. That sort of thing comes from Eastern religion.<br> To meditate means to think about, mull over, ponder. This very kind of Bible study we're engaged in involves us in the process of meditation.<br> We have the text and a list of questions: What? Why? Where? Who? <br>And so we read and think and try to understand. That is meditation.</p>
<p>
Someone said that studying the Scripture was like "thinking God's thoughts after Him."I like that. When we read the Word of God we are doing that, retracing in our minds what God is thinking. The more we do that, the more we begin to understand God and the way he thinks. The more we leave the mindset of our secular world-view, we are <font color= "blue">"transformed by the renewing of your mind"<br> (Rom 12:2).</font> With it comes faith, a confidence in God.<br>

In a classic statement of the role of scripture in this, Paul writes,<br><font color= "blue"> "So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God" (Rom 10:17).</font></p>
<h3>
Faith and Trust
</h3>
<p>
So God's encouragement and exhortation to Joshua that day met his needs:</p>
<p>
Faith Assurance: <font color= "blue">"I will not leave you nor forsake you." (Joshua 1:5)</font></p>
<p>
Faith Exhortation:<font color= "blue"> "Be strong and of good courage;" (Joshua 1:6,9)</font></p>
<p>
Faith Food: <font color= "blue">"Meditate in it day and night" (Joshua 1:8)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">
God's Success Formula</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success. (Joshua 1:8)</font></p>
<p>With these instructions come the keys to prosperity and success.
<p><font size="+1">
The World's Success Formula</font></p>
<p>
I see book stores full of books on "success." You can buy tapes to reprogram your mind to think successful thoughts. And so on. And much of what they say is true. But it is not complete.</p>

<p><font size="+1">
God Says ...</font></p>
<p>
Trust in me.<font color= "blue"> I will not leave you nor forsake you. (Joshua 1:5)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Be strong and of good courage; do not be afraid, nor be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go (Joshua 1:9)</font></p>
<p>
Meditate on God's word <font color= "blue">"day and night", (Joshua 1:8)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success (Joshua 1:8)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">
The World Says ...</font></p>
<p>
Trust in yourself</p>
<p>
Boldly strive for your dream</p>
<p>
Think good thoughts, positive thoughts</p>
<p>
Then you will be prosperous and successful</p>
<p>
Be aware of the differences. Faith in ourselves will ultimately disappoint us.<br> We are told not to do that in the Bible.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him,and He shall direct your paths." (Prov 3:5-6)</font></p>
<p>
The world says: be bold, strive for your dream, take risks. And these things are important. But our motivation for boldness is faith in God's promises.</p>
<p>
While positive thinking is essential to faith, it is not faith itself. It only opens they way to faith thoughts within us.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy—meditate on these things" (Phil 4:8)</font></p>
<p>
Positive thinking is a partial truth, not a full truth. The full truth is that we should meditate on God's word, not just motivational hype. </p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, “If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed. And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free" (John 8:31-32).</font></p>
<p>
The world tempts us with the promise of prosperity and success without God. But the fact is, that whatever measure of prosperity and success we find without God will profit us nothing in the long run.</p>
<p>
Jesus tells us: <font color= "blue">"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God" (Matt 4:4 quoting Deut 8:3).</font></p> 
<p>He says,<font color= "blue"> "You cannot serve God and Mammon" (Matt 6:24).</font></p> 
<p>He says, <font color= "blue">"For what profit is it to a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul? Or what will a man give in exchange for his soul?" (Matt 16:26)</font></p>
