Know that You are a New Man
</h1>
<h3>
Paul Judges Jesus According to the Flesh
</h3>
<p>
Paul, prior to his conversion, had judged Christ according to the flesh and
had found Him lacking. To Paul, Christ was a pretender who pushed too far
and had gotten what was coming to Him when He was condemned by the
Sanhedrin and crucified by the Romans. In fact, to Paul, Christ’s crucifixion
confirmed that He was a pretender based on the teaching of Deut 21:23 that stated that a man who had been hung on a tree was cursed by God. Therefore, to Paul, Christ’s death on the cross appropriately and emphatically ended all of His Messianic pretensions; or in other words, His death on the cross of Calvary confirmed to Paul that Christ was a fraud.</p>
<p>
But as we all know this earlier perception was dramatically reversed when
Christ, in a glorious post-resurrection appearance, confronted Paul while he
was on his way to Damascus to persecute Christians. <br>At that moment in time
his view of Christ changed. Or in other words, at that moment Paul was able
to view Christ not as a fraud but rather as the Messiah, the Son of the living God. So even though Paul had earlier judged Christ according to the flesh, he after this encounter no longer did so.</p>
<h3>
Paul Judged According to the Flesh
</h3>
<p>
But very ironically, as Paul was writing the epistle of 2 Cor, he was
now the one being judged according to the flesh, or in other words according
to the external misplaced standards of the world in the same manner as he
himself had judged Christ earlier in his life. And who was doing this? His
critics within the church of Corinth were doing this. And why were they
doing this? They were doing this in order to disparage Paul and diminish his
influence among the Corinthians.</p>
<p>
And as a result of their onslaught against him, Paul, as an apostle of Christ,
felt compelled to respond to these attacks strongly, which in turn launched
further attacks against him by his critics.<br>
And this brings us to 2 Cor 5:16-17. So how do these verses fit into
the flow of the text? Paul, in 2 Cor 5:14-15, in an attempt to explain 
his strong response to his critics, especially as put forth in the so-called
“severe letter,” a response that some in Corinth apparently deemed out of
line, detailed for the church of Corinth two driving motivations that he
hoped would not only explain his strong response to his critics but would
also explain why he lived in the manner that he lived, or in other words why
he lived a revolutionary lifestyle.</p>
<h3>
Paul’s Driving Motivations
</h3>
<p>
So, what were the two driving motivations that contributed not only to
Paul’s passionate response to his critics but to the way he lived his life
according to <br>2 Cor 5:11-15?<br>
Paul’s first driving motivation was the fear of the Lord. We saw this spelled
out for us in these verses and this is what they say. <br><font color= "blue">“Knowing, therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; but we are well known to God, and I also trust are well known in your consciences.  For we do not commend ourselves again to you, but give you opportunity to boast on our behalf, that you may have an answer for those who boast in appearance and not in heart. For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; or if we are of sound mind, it is for you.” (2 Cor 5:11-13)</font></p>
<p>
Paul’s second driving motivation that contributed to his revolutionary
lifestyle was the love of Christ. And we saw this spelled out for us by Paul: <br><font color= "blue">“For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if One died for all, then all died; and He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again.” (2 Cor 5:14-15)</font>
The fear of the Lord and the love of Christ formed the basis of Paul’s
revolutionary lifestyle, a lifestyle which was totally and completely dictated
not by what served him but rather by what served Christ, the One who loved
Him and who had given up His life for Him.</p>
<h3>
How Paul Viewed Jesus
</h3>
<p>
So, what do we learn from how Paul viewed people? The first thing we learned about Paul was he no longer viewed people according to the flesh after his conversion.<font color= "blue">
“Therefore, from now on, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him thus no longer.” (2 Cor 5:16)</font></p>
<p>
Paul began 2 Cor 5:16 with the word “therefore.” The word “therefore” points back to 2 Cor 5:14-15 and to the love of Christ that compelled Him as our substitute to die our death so that we might live through Him.</p>
<p>
Now after pointing his readers back to this monumental event that is at the
heart of the gospel message he then goes on to say, “Therefore from now on [or in other words, since our conversion, made possible through Christ’s death] we recognise no one according to the flesh.” <br>So, what did that mean?
When Paul said that he recognised no one according to his flesh, he simply
meant that after his conversion he no longer viewed anybody based on worldly
distinctions or expectations.</p>
<p>
But his perception of Christ changed very dramatically didn’t it? <br>Isn’t that
exactly what Paul told us at the end of 2 Cor 5:16 when he said,<br> “Yet now we
know Him [referring to Christ] in this way no longer?”<br>
Paul, prior to his conversion, having known Christ according to the flesh, had rejected Him, but after his conversion he no longer viewed Him as a fraud but as God incarnate, the Saviour of the world. And he came to view Christ just as God viewed Christ. This is how we should view Christ not according to the flesh but rather according to the Spirit.</p>
<p>
And that is the only way that we as the followers of Christ should view
people. We need to look at people through the eyes of Christ. May God give
us the grace to do this so that we, in the name of Christ and in His strength,
serve them to the glory of God. </p>
<h3>
A New Creation
</h3>
<p>
<font color= "blue">“Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.” (2 Cor 5:17)</font><br> So, what exactly was Paul seeking to communicate by these words?<br>
Let us begin by looking at the very first word, the word “therefore.”<br> The
word “therefore” at the beginning of 2 Cor 5:17 once again points us back to
2 Cor 5:14-15 and to the love of Christ that compelled Him as our
substitute to die our death so that we might live through Him.
If Christ had not been willing to die our death then we would have continued to view people as the world views people rather than as God views people, and we would never have had the opportunity to view ourselves as new creatures in Christ. <br>And this is a truly exciting thing.</p>
<p>
The phrase “in Christ” succinctly and profoundly summarises all the rich
blessings of salvation: <br>(cf. Rom 8:1; 16:3, 7; 1 Cor 1:30; Gal 3:28; Eph 1:1; Phil 1:1; 4:21; <br>Col 1:2, 28; Philemon 23).<br>
It speaks of our security in Him who has borne in His own body the judgement of God against our sin. This and much more is contained in this simple phrase “in Christ,” which speaks of our identification with Christ through the baptising work of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>
Therefore if anyone [no matter how vile they might have been] is in Christ, he is a new creature; the old things passed away and he is reborn.</p>
<p>
So now let us put these two thoughts together. The old has past away
permanently. Praise God! And the new has come to stay and will continue to
be new because the newness is not a newness that in the course of time
grows old and outmoded rather it is a newness that is everlastingly new.
Praise God!<br>
The passing of the old and the coming of the new was most likely meant by
Paul to call to mind the old and new covenants that Paul has already
repeatedly contrasted earlier in the epistle (2 Cor 3:6).<br>
An example of this contrast is  where he says that we have been made<br> <font color= "blue">“ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.” (2 Cor 3:6)</font><br> So therefore if Paul did in fact want his words in 2 Cor 5:17 to call to our minds what he earlier said about the old and new covenants then all things have become new have come to us “in Christ” and flow out from the new covenant blessings of Jer 31.
May God give us the grace to view people, whether they are saved or unsaved, as He views people, and may we respond accordingly</p>
<h3>
Alienation Contrasted with Reconciliation 
</h3>
<p>
Now Paul spells out the contrast:<font color= "blue">
"And you, who once were alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now He has reconciled in the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy, and blameless, and above reproach in His sight—." (Col 1:21-22)</font><br>

The Bible tells us in Col 1:21-22 what Christians were before they were saved by Christ. It tells what Christ did in order to provide for their salvation and the purpose that Jesus wants to see realised in the life of each Christian.</p>
 <p>
Until you become saved by Christ you are “enemies in your mind by wicked works.” Those who are not saved are called the enemies of God because they belong to the spirit of darkness and in some way they contribute to the kingdom of darkness that opposes God and Christ. Whoever is not with Christ is against Christ.<br> The enemies of God are enemies in the mind “by wicked works.” It all starts by what is taking place in the mind. Once you know Christ, your mind changes. Once your mind changes, your works will change also. What a person thinks about results in what a person does.</p>
 <p>
The problem is that every person has done wicked works: sin. And “the wages of sin is death.” The ultimate death is spiritual death, eternal separation from God. But God loves us. God does not want any one of us to go out into eternity to pay the wages of our own sins. <br><font color= "blue">“For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life.” (John 3:16)</font> </p>
<p>
Even though Jesus was sinless, He paid the penalty for sin. Several words were used in this verse and in Col 1:20 to emphasise the price that Jesus paid so that we could be saved: blood, cross, body, flesh, death. His skin was slashed from His back with a whip. His beard was ripped form His face. A crown of cruel thorns was beaten into his skull. His hands and His feet were pierced, and His side was stabbed with a spear. It was a terrible bloody death that Jesus suffered on a cruel Roman cross in order to pay the penalty for sin. </p>
<p>
But in addition to saving us from our sins, He also wants to see another result of the price that He paid for us. He wants to see us become <font color= "blue">“holy, and blameless, and above reproach in His sight—” (Col 1:22)</font><br> It is important to do God’s will. What is God’s will for each Christian? <br>God’s will for you centres around the question of what kind of person that you are. If you become the person that God wants you to be then you will end up doing what God wants you to do.</p>
<p> 
Some Christians will not fulfil God’s will. Some Christians will not become what God wants them to become. Much can be lost. </p>
<h3>
A Chosen Generation
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvellous light;” (1 Peter 2:9)</font></p>
<p>
Now Peter talks about the first of four privileges for the believer. <br>These four privileges orient the believer to God’s prerogatives for him.<br> Each description describes positional truth. </p>
 <p>
All four privileges relate to our status with Christ. Therefore, we are left without any illusions about ourselves. These four phrases have nothing to do with how we feel; they have to do with what God did for us. Therefore, Christianity is grace oriented. Christianity is grace. Grace always depends on who and what God is. It never depends upon us. </p>
<p><font size="+1"> 
Chosen Generation</font></p>
<p> 
“Chosen generation” is the first of a four-fold description of a believer. In contrast to those destined for destruction, Christians are a chosen race or generation. God uses the phrase “chosen people” for both Israel and the church. God told Moses at Sinai to tell Israel. <br><font color= "blue">“You shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation” (Ex 19:6).</font></p>
<p>
Here are some of the New Testament references to election.</p>
 <p><font color= "blue">
“For many are called, but few are chosen.” (Matt 22:14)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“You did not choose Me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you.” (John 15:16)</font></p>
 <p><font color= "blue">
“If you were of the world, the world would love its own. Yet because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. (John 15:19)</font></p>
 <p><font color= "blue">
“But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God from the beginning chose you for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth, to which He called you by our gospel, for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.” (2 Thes 2:13-14)</font></p>
 <p><font color= "blue">
“These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and those who are with Him are called, chosen, and faithful.” (Rev 17:14)</font></p>
 <p><font color= "blue">
“Just as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and without blame before Him in love.” (Eph 1:4)</font></p>
 <p>
“Generation” is a class of people who have a common decent and life.<br> Christians are a spiritual race. It is not simply those living in the first century. The church is a race based on spiritual birth (regeneration). We enter this generation by spiritual birth. We enter into union with Jesus Christ forever. </p>
<p>
Christians carry corporate title. All true Christians are chosen group diverse from those without Christ. </p>
 <h3>
Principle 
 </h3>
<p>
At salvation we enter into the same position that Jesus has before God forever. </p>
 <h3>
Application
</h3>
 <p>
Christianity is a relationship not a religion. Religion is an attempt to gain the approbation of God. Christianity means that God is satisfied with us no matter what because of Christ. Our prerogatives are completely accomplished by God through Christ apart from human work.<br> It is fully the work of God. It is the grace of God. </p>
