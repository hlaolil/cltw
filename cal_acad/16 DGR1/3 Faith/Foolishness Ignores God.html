  <h1>
Foolishness Ignores God
</h1>
<h3>
There is No God
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none who does good". (Psa 14:1)</font></p>
<p>
The very first words to come out of David’s mouth as he pens this psalm is “the fool.” To call someone a fool is to use very strong and harsh language to someone. I do not think anyone appreciates being called a fool.<br> Furthermore, I think being called a fool is one of the more insulting things that can be said about someone. So grave are these words that Jesus said if we were to slanderously call our brother a fool, we are in danger of hell fire (Matt 5:22).</p>
<p>
David begins by describing what many people say within their hearts,<br> “There is no God.” <br>The idea of atheism is not a new invention that we face in our battle for the Lord. There have always been and will continue to be people who will not believe that there is a God. David says that those who say in their hearts that there is no God are fools.</p>
<p>
But this is not really just a matter of theoretical atheism. The fool is not only the person who has a belief that there is no God. Some of the translations use italics in the statement “there is no God” on the words “there is” to show that these words are added by the translators. Literally, the fool says “no God, no God.” Essentially, the person says that there is no room for God for me. No God for me, please, no God for me.</p>
<p>
Therefore, we are not merely dealing with the scholarly of the world who believe they can prove that there is no God. We are also looking at those people who by their actions show that there is no God in their lives. People who live with no room for God in their lives are called fools. Why would David say these people who make no room for God in their lives are fools?</p>
<h3>
Why are These People Fools?
</h3>
<p>
God has revealed Himself says Paul, in the first chapter of Romans, and gives many good arguments as to why people are fools for not accepting that there is a God and not making room in their lives for God.<br> Paul said,<font color= "blue">“For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse,” (Rom 1:20).</font> <br>We are fools if we cannot look at the things of the world and realise that there is someone greater than ourselves. We are fools if we cannot see the power of this universe and that something divine created us. These attributes of God can be seen by anyone, not just the really smart, scholarly people. Because of these things, God says we are without excuse for not knowing there is a God.</p>
<h3>
People suppress the Truth 
</h3>
 <p>
If God’s invisible attributes can be clearly seen through the creation, why do people still claim there is no God and make no room for God in their lives? <br>Paul addresses this question two verses earlier. <font color= "blue">“For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, because what may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown it to them.” (Rom 1:18-19).</font><br> Paul tells us that people are suppressing the truth that has been shown to them by God because of their ungodliness and unrighteousness. People do not believe in God because they do not want to believe in God, and it is as simple as that. God has revealed Himself to all people. To then say that there is no God, or that there is no room for God, they simply suppress the truth which they know. <br>This is why they are fools: they are ignoring the clearly revealed truths of God’s existence.</p>
<h3>
Results in Corruption
</h3>
<p>
The result of believing that there is no God and refusing to make room for God in our lives is that we become corrupt. David makes this point clearly in the rest of the first verse of Psa 14. “They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none who does good.“</p>
<p>
When we choose to either be theoretical atheists by saying there is no God or be practical atheists by making no room for God in our lives, we will become corrupt. We will begin to do abominable things. <br>We are fools when God is not in our lives.</p>
