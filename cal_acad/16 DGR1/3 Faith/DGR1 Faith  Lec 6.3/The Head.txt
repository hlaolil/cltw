For the earth yields crops by itself: first the blade, then the head, after that the full grain in the head. (Mark 4:28)</font></p>

So, what lessons do seeds teach us? Seeds grow quietly but persistently. Like seeds, the growth of God's kingdom is the result of divine power, not human effort. This "Parable of the Growing Seed" in Mark 4:26-32 shows the manner in which the kingdom of God makes progress in the world. There is a law of orderly development in natural growth, so also is it in reference to spiritual growth. Let the Word of Christ have the place it ought to have in a soul, and it will show itself in good fruit. It grows gradually: first the blade; then the ear; after that the full corn in the ear. When it has sprung up, it will go forward. The work of grace in the soul is, at first, but the day of small things; but what will there be when it is perfected in heaven! The work of grace gradually increases under the instrumentality of the Word, accompanied with the Spirit and power of God.</p>

And, let us do nothing to stifle the optimal growth of corn like contaminating the soil or genetically modifying the seed.</p>
<h3>
The Full Corn
</h3>
<p>  
The grain swollen to its proper size. By this is denoted, undoubtedly, that grace or faith in the heart of man is of gradual growth. It is at first tender, feeble, perhaps almost imperceptible, like the first shootings of the grain in the earth. Perhaps also, like grain, it often lies long in the earth before there are signs of life. Like the tender grain, also, it needs care, kindness, and culture. A frost, a cold storm, or a burning sun alike injure it. So reverence for God in the heart needs care, kindness, culture. It needs shelter from the frosts and storms of a cold, unfeeling world. It needs the genial dews and mild suns of heaven; in other words, it needs instruction, prayer, and friendly counsel from parents, teachers, ministers, and experienced Christians, that it may grow, and bring forth the full fruits of holiness. Like the grain, also, in due time it will grow strong; it will produce its appropriate fruit - a full and rich harvest - to the praise of God.</p>
