<h1>
Sarah's Faith
</h1>
<p>
God spoke to Abram and made a covenant with him. As part of this covenant, God told Abram that he and Sarai would have a child that would be named Isaac. God also said that the covenant and blessings that went along with it would be established through Isaac and his descendants, not Ishmael (Gen 17:18-21).
During this conversation, God also changed the names of Abram and Sarai. He changed Abram to Abraham and Sarai to Sarah. With these name changes would come changes to Abraham and Sarah’s life. In Sarah’s case, God would bless her with the birth of Isaac. However, He would also make her “a mother of nations” and “kings of people” would come from her descendants.</p>
<p>
Despite these promises, both Abraham and Sarah both found it hard to believe as they were 100 and 99 years old respectively. In fact, when Abraham heard this he laughed. Later, when Sarah heard this she laughed as well (Gen 18:9-15). However, as God had promised, Isaac, whose name means laughter (Gen 21:3-7), was born and the covenant was established. Sarah died at the age of 127 years and was buried in a cave Abraham purchased in Mechpelah, known today as Hebron (Gen 23).</p>
<h3>
Sarah’s Legacy
</h3>
<p>
Although there are many more things that happened in Sarah’s life, she has left a legacy that serves as something to consider by believers today:<br>
Sarah was the mother of nations: Gen 17:15-16<br>
Sarah was beautiful: Gen 12:11<br>
Sarah was impatient when it came to believing God’s promises being fulfilled: Gen 15:3-4; Gen 16:1-6; Gen 18:12-15<br>
Sarah could be jealous and harsh when things did not work out how she wanted: Gen 16:4-6; Gen 21:9-11</p><br>
Sarah was honoured by God despite her imperfections: Gen 17:15-16<br>
Sarah’s faith enabled her to be strengthened to conceive and deliver Isaac in her old age: Heb 11:11-12<br>
Sarah’s faith resulted in a changed life when it came to her relationship with her husband: 1 Peter 3:1-7</p>
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
Sarah was a beautiful woman who initially lived her life lacking faith in God’s promises and ability to do what He said He would do. Her impatience resulted in poor decisions that revealed she could be jealous and harsh. However, as her faith grew, she became a great woman of faith that God used to fulfil His plan. Sarah’s story shows us that it does not matter who we are, where we come from, our age, nor any other personal strengths or weaknesses, God can produce changes in us through our faith that can result in miraculous influence in our personal and extended relationships for generations to come.</p>
