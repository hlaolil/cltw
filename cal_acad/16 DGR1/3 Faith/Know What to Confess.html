  <h1>
Know What to Confess
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. (Heb 4:14) </font></p>
<p>
For a long time I was confused over the fact that in my own life and the lives of others there was a continual sense of defeat and failure. I prayed for the sick. <br>I knew that the Bible was true, and I searched diligently to find the leakage. <br>One day I saw Heb 4:14, that we are to hold fast to our confession. <br>In Heb 3, I discovered that Christianity is called "The Great Confession". <br>I asked myself, "What Confession am I to hold fast?"</p>
<p>
I am to hold fast to my confession of the absolute integrity of the Bible.<br> I am to hold fast to the confession of the redemptive work of Christ.<br> I am to hold fast to my confession of the New Creation, of receiving the Life and Nature of God. <br>I am to hold fast to the confession that God is the strength of my life. <br>I am to hold fast to the confession that "Surely He has borne my sicknesses and carried my diseases, and that by His stripes I am healed."</p>
<p>
I hold fast to that confession in the face of apparent contradictions, and He is bound to make good. Many believers have failed when things become difficult because they lost their confession. While the sun was shining brightly, their confessions were vigorous, strong and clear. But when the storms came, the testings came, and the adversary was taking advantage of them they gave up their testimony.</p>
<p>
Every time that you confess disease and weakness and failure, you magnify the adversary above the Father, and you destroy your own confidence in the Word. You are to hold fast to your confession in the face of apparent defeat.<br> You are to study the Word until you know what your rights are, and then hold fast to them.</p>
<p>
Some make confessions without any foundations. Then the adversary whips and beats them badly. You are to find out what your rights are. <br>For instance, you know that God says, "Surely He has borne our sicknesses and carried our diseases." Now you can make your confession.<br> "In all these things I am more than a conqueror. For greater is He that is in me, than he that is in the world." Stand by your confession through thick and thin, through good report and evil. You know that your confession is according to the Word.</p>
