The Environment of the Seed

<h3>
The Parable of the Sower Explained
</h3>
<p>
“Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God. Those by the wayside are the ones who hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved. But the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away. Now the ones that fell among thorns are those who, when they have heard, go out and are choked with cares, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity. But the ones that fell on the good ground are those who, having heard the word with a noble and good heart, keep it and bear fruit with patience.</p>
<h3>
Purpose
</h3>
<p> 
To help us rightly approach God’s Word so that we can bear a rich crop. We are not focusing on the four categories as much as seeking to understand our own responses towards God’s Word and have a heart described to rightly receive God’s Word even as the good soil received the seed.
<h3>
The Good Soil 
</h3>
<p>
Our focus should be on the seed that grew and bore a hundredfold crop. This is what we want. “And the seed in the good soil, these are the ones who have heard the word in an honest and good heart, and hold it fast, and bear fruit with perseverance.” I told you this gets very personal. Your choice to obey God’s Word will prosper you. You have a choice to put God’s will and others ahead of your selfish preferences. This decision will keep popping up when you read or hear His Word because this is the mirror that helps us see who we are and what God wants.</p>

Four Kinds of Soil

Please observe the blessing that follows those who obey the Word of God–they grow to maturity and bear fruit. The same is true with a seed. If you told me that this little seed will grow big and bear a lot of fruit, it sounds like a big story, but when we have observed it happen again and again, you actually want to plant a garden and profit from this mysterious principle. The same is true spiritually. 
Jesus says there are three things that rightly prepare the heart for such a harvest. The heart that responds has “heard the word in an honest and good heart.” In other words, they want to hear God’s Word. They do not use devious schemes to get ahead in life or grab another’s girl or boy friend. Nothing like that. Honesty deliberately dodges deceit. Honesty puts others ahead of oneself while dishonesty places oneself before others.</p>
<p>
They have a good heart, seeking God’s wisdom and ways and are eager to incorporate into their lives. Where we fail to live according to God’s Word, then our lives begin to suffer. (I am not stating that all suffering comes from disobedience but much does. Some comes through pruning, which is only making us more effective, fruit bearing.) But when we eagerly seek God’s wisdom and Word, then we eagerly adopt it–this sets us up to marvellously reap from His Word.</p>
<h3>
Conclusion 
</h3>
<p>
This simple parable unfolds many truths.</p>
<p>
(1) God’s Word is needed and to be trusted. The most important is the fact that God causes great fruit from hearing and obeying God’s Word. We do not need to experience things to know things, but can trust His Word and therefore avoid the evil. You miss out on nothing. </p>
<p>
(2) God’s Word leads to salvation. Watch out for the struggle to believe in Christ for salvation. Jesus is not just another god to adopt for security but the Lord of the universe demanding our soul, heart and mind. The heart of the gospel is that God has given His Son to love us. Love is the backdrop of salvation.</p>
<p>
(3) Responsiveness to God’s Word must continually be monitored. Believers constantly face the struggle with what are you going to do with the Word of God. Do you really want the Word of God? Most of Christian growth is composed of learning to hear and obey the Lord. Read the Bible more and you will grow more. If you sense the Word not connecting with your soul, repent and confess any known sin and humbly ask Him to teach you as you again eagerly seek His Word.</p>
