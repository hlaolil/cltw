Faith

<h3>
Having Faith and Trusting in God
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen. For by it the elders obtained a good testimony. ... But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.”  (Heb 11:1-2,6)</font></p>
<p> 
In its essence, faith is simply trusting God. It is being willing to believe God and His Word even if the outward circumstances appear to contradict it.<br> It is knowing that God is good even when only bad things seem to be happening to us. Job is, of course, the prime example of this. He lost everything from his wealth to his family to his health, yet he still clung to God. <br>Part of the devil's tricks is to get us to put faith in what we see and feel rather than in the Word and character of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<h3>
Acting on Faith and Trust in God
</h3>
<p>
Believing and acting on a general faith in God is where things start, but faith is personal. God has given many promises in His Word. Faith takes those promises and begins to live them out. There are two aspects to this.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
First</font></p>
<p>
Faith seeks to obey the Word of God because it trusts the God Who gave it. <br>It knows that obedience is an act of love and devotion. Faith knows that it many not see the results immediately - if it did, faith would not be necessary. <br>And so the person of faith continues to align his or her life with the Word of God in love whether or not they see any immediate personal benefits.<br> For example, the husband whose wife is on the point of divorcing him and turns to God in repentance of his sins will, in faith, continue to follow God even if he ends up losing his wife and family.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Second </font></p>
<p>
When God makes a promise in His Word real to the individual heart of a believer, the person of faith will act on it even if it seems foolish. <br>In fact, it probably will seem foolish to the natural eyes. This is where it becomes vital to hear what God is actually saying individually and not to hear simply what we want God to say. If God has made a promise real in our hearts then we know God will follow through and we can stand confidently in the face of opposition because we "know" God has spoken to us in that area.<br> We may not be able to explain to family or friends how we know - and they may think we are crazy - but we know God has spoken to us. And that is enough. </p>
<p>
An example of this would be a person who leaves a well-paying job to start a new church. From a human perspective this is a very foolish and risky thing to do and finances may be tight to non-existent, but if the person knows in faith it is what God has called him to do, he can launch out knowing that God's arms are under him and he will accomplish the will of God.</p>
