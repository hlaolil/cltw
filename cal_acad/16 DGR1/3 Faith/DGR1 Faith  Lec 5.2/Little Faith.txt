<h3>
A Story of Little Faith
</h3>
<p>
I had to ask myself this as an episode in my life today caused me to be fearful and doubtful and to tell the truth, down right scared! I mean, I was all anxious and butterflies in the tummy type worried. But God sent a friend to deliver a message to me and that message was basically that God's Plan's for my life are according to His Will and that no matter what happens with the situation I was going through, it is God Will and His Will is <i>always</i> prefect and true! </p>
<p>
As I thought about that message during the rest of my day, the Holy Spirit started to bring God's Word back to my remembrance. And one of the verse that struck me, and it did strike my spirit was "But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind." (James 1:6) I began to wonder if my faith was tossed and driven my the rough seas of life. Was I only faithful when the seas were calm? When the storms of life began to rock my boat was I like the disciples who woke Jesus and cried that they were going to perish? And like them, I needed to hear Jesus say to me, <font color= "blue">"But He said to them, "Why are you fearful, O you of little faith?" Then He arose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm." (Matt 8:26).</font> When we trust in Jesus and bring Him our storms, He calms them and makes our seas smooth. Now it may not always be to our liking, but it will always be according to His Will. </p>
<h3>
Why You Need Faith
</h3>
<p>
The Word of God says,<font color= "blue"> "But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him." (Heb 11:6)</font> and I know today, I was not very pleasing to Him by my lack of faith, but through repentance and prayer, I know my God forgives me! </p>
<p>
I am going to end with this verse because to me it sums up the power and blessing of having faith in our Father and His Son, Jesus Christ! 
<font color= "blue">"So Jesus said to them, "Because of your unbelief; for assuredly, I say to you, if you have faith as a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, "Move from here to there,' and it will move; and nothing will be impossible for you.". (Matt 17:20)</font> That is so awesome! Do you know how small a mustard seed is? And with that amount of Faith, you can move the mountains that are facing you in life!! Thank You so much Father, for Your blessing and tender mercies and for the faith that You give me everyday. And I know no matter what, You are always with Me and before me to clear my paths and calm my seas.  </p>
