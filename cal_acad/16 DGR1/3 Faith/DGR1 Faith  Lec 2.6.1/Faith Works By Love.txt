Faith Works By Love

<h3>
Understanding God's Word about Faith/Love
</h3>
<p>
Faith is the hand that takes the things we need from God. Everything Jesus purchased for us on Calvary can be obtained by faith. This includes salvation, healing, the fullness of the Spirit, the gifts of the Spirit, the fruit of the Spirit, and victory over the world, the flesh, the devil, and all the powers of darkness.</p>

For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith working through love (Gal 5:6).</font></p>
<p>
Faith is not working for some Christians because they do not have a full understanding of what the Word of God says about faith.
Bible teachers say we must have faith to please God, but some casually pass over the teachings that faith works by love, and that God is love. When I was a boy, there were many subjects I used to hear preached. One was the power in the blood. Another was this subject of love. All of these subjects must fit together.</p>
<p>
If we are to live in line with God’s Word, we must not only be faith children of a faith God, but we must also be love children of a love God. Too many Christians do not have any knowledge about walking in love. We need to understand all facets of it. The love of God needs to ooze out of us so much that when we walk into a room, people will know we are living in love!</p>
<p>
If we are going to make our faith house strong, we must make its foundations strong. And the foundation of faith is love. The Kingdom of God has been damaged by people who have heard the faith message once and have run off with it without knowing what they were doing or how to use what they had heard. Before long, they came crashing down and didn’t understand why.</p>
<h3>
Walking in Love
</h3>
<p>
We can make all the confessions we want to. We can quote the Bible day and night. We can fast and pray, and we still won’t get anything if we are not walking in love. The Word says faith works by love. But if we’re not walking in love, our faith won’t work!
When we check up on ourselves, we will often find certain areas where we are not really walking in love—and these areas are keeping our faith from operating at full capacity. We’ve become so accustomed to doing certain things in the natural realm—things such as losing our temper—that we never realise how these things hinder us in the spiritual realm!</p>
<p>
I have learned that if I am to maintain any kind of faith walk, I must put down my carnal nature. The secret is letting the love of God work within my spirit.
Love is more interested in others than in itself. But when we begin operating in this realm of love, we will be blessed. When we get so busy unselfishly helping others obtain blessings that we forget about ourselves, we will find honour, success, and promotion for ourselves.</p>
<p>
The Word of God also instructs us to love our neighbours as ourselves (Mark 12:31). We cannot really love others until we love ourselves. Some people will say, “Oh, I don’t want to be arrogant. We’re supposed to be humble!” Yes, but there is a difference between being arrogant and loving ourselves. A person can be arrogant and still not love himself or herself.
We should know who and what we are in Christ and what we have because of Him. If we know these things, we will realise that we are kings who sit in heavenly places with Christ. That will give us a good self-image!</p>
<p>
Many marriages are faltering because two people who don’t love themselves are trying to love each other. But when you think about it, they can’t really love their mate if they don’t even love themselves.
When we make it a point to walk in love, we’ll find that the God-kind of love spills over into every aspect of our lives. Not only will we reap spiritual benefits; we will reap natural benefits that we never thought possible.</p>
<p>
We’ll discover that good things are happening to us. Promotions are coming. The money we need is coming. Everything we need is coming to us. As we walk the love walk, we are not having to make all these good things happen—they are happening automatically.<p>
