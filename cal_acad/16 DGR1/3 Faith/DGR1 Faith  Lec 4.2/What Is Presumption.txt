What Is Presumption
</h1>
<h3>
Attempting to Manipulate God
</h3>
<p>
Presumption is trying to force God to do our will. Jesus was tempted to presumption when Satan told Him to jump off the pinnacle of the temple (Luke 4:1-13). Satan even had Scripture to back him up. He was challenging Jesus to believe and act on the Word of God! How unScriptural would it be for Jesus to ignore what the Bible plainly said. Jesus didn't have to "prove" Scripture or defend His faith. Jesus knew that that Scripture wasn’t God’s will for His life at that time. For everything there is a time and a season. To have done something foolish and expected God to protect Him would have been the sin of presumption. In grace God may have protected Him or God may have allowed Him to suffer the consequences of His actions. Of course, we know that Jesus answered the devil with Scripture showing that the devil's Scripture-backed proposition was actually disobedience and sin.</p>

Presumption is attempting to manipulate God. It relies on the some principles as witchcraft. Witchcraft believes that it can manipulate the supernatural [angels, demons, spirits, etc] through the use of words [spells], rituals or potions. It is trying to control the spirit realm for personal or selfish purposes. Notice I did not say that when Christians fall into the sin of presumption they are practising witchcraft. But what they are unconsciously doing is using the same principles that witchcraft is based on. Principles that are:<br>
a] abhorrent to God and <br>
b] do not work. God will not be manipulated by our presumption of His love and grace.</p>

Some people have refused to take vital medicine or refused necessary operations claiming God would heal them. They have placed their lives [and in some cases the lives of their children] in danger. They have thought they were operating in faith. In fact, if they did not have a personal, direct Word of God, they were operating in presumption. They were trying, perhaps unconsciously, to force God to do their will instead of seeking for God’s will. Now, don’t misunderstand me, I believe in divine healing. But faith is believing God’s Word - having Him make it real to us - and waiting for His timing.</p>
<p>
My father, a former pastor, has told of a lady who he had to several times drive to emergency at a hospital because she stopped taking vital medicine in the belief that God had healed her. No one can doubt her sincerity. She was willing to risk her life on her belief. She knew and believed God's general will of healing, what she did not have, based on the results, was God specific word to her that He had healed her. She desperately wanted to be healed. Perhaps unconsciously she thought if she "proved" her faith by not taking her medicine, God would be forced to honour His Word and heal her. This is exactly the same temptation to presumption that Jesus faced on the top of the temple. God responds to faith, not to presumption.</p>
<p>
Faith hears from God, presumption tells Him what to do [and usually when to do it.]</p>
<h3>
Faith Alive
</h3>
<p>
Another misconception about faith is that it is something we can work up in ourselves. Saying, “ I believe” a million times does not create faith only presumption. We can’t talk ourselves into it. Even memorising and repeating Scripture [as good as that is] doesn’t create faith. Faith is a work of God, presumption is a work of man. Faith comes by hearing/studying the Word of God and having the Holy Spirit quicken it to our hearts.
<font color= "blue">For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest anyone should boast. (Eph 2:8-9)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God  (Rom 10:17)</font></p>
<p>
If we don’t have faith in a given situation we do not need to be condemned. We shouldn’t try humanistic/physiological tricks to work it up. We will only end up with presumption. We come to God and confess our lack of faith. We ask God to grant us His gift of faith and we study His Word. The fact that we are willing to honestly lay it all before God is itself an act of faith. And in faith we leave it in His hands. We have faith in God even when we can’t see our way through a given situation.</p>
