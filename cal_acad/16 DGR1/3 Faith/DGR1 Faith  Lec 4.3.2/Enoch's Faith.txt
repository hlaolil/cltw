<h1>
Enoch's Faith
</h1>
<p>
Enoch holds a rare distinction in the Bible: He did not die. Instead, God "took him away."
Scripture does not reveal much about this remarkable man. We find his story in Gen 5, in a long list of the descendants of Adam.</p>
<p>
Only a short sentence, "Enoch walked faithfully with God," in Gen 5:22 and repeated in Gen 5:24 reveals why he was so special to his Creator. In this wicked period before the Flood, most men did not walk faithfully with God. They walked their own path, the crooked way of sin. Enoch did not keep silent about the sin around him. Jude says Enoch prophesied about those evil people:
<font color= "blue">
"Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement on all, to convict all who are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have committed in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him." (Jude 1:14-15)</font></p>
<p>
Enoch walked in faith the 365 years of his life, and that made all the difference. No matter what happened, he trusted God. He obeyed God. God loved Enoch so much He spared him the experience of death.
Heb 11, that great Faith Hall of Fame passage, says Enoch's faith pleased God:
For before he was taken, he was commended as one who pleased God. <font color= "blue">"without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him". (Heb 11:5-6)</font></p>
<p>
What happened to Enoch? The Bible gives few details, other than to say:
<font color= "blue">
"And Enoch walked with God; and he was not, for God took him." (Gen 5:24)</font></p>
<p>
Only one other person in Scripture was honoured this way: the prophet Elijah. God took that faithful servant to heaven in a whirlwind (2 Kings 2:11).</p>
<p>
Enoch's great-grandson, <font color= "blue">Noah was a just man, perfect in his generations. Noah walked with God" (Gen 6:9).</font> Because of his righteousness, only Noah and his family were spared in the Great Flood.

<p>
Enoch and the other Old Testament heroes mentioned in the Faith Hall of Fame walked in faith, in the hope of a future Messiah. That Messiah has been revealed to us in the gospels as Jesus Christ.
When we trust Christ as Saviour and walk with God, as Enoch did, we will die physically, but will be resurrected to eternal life.</p>
