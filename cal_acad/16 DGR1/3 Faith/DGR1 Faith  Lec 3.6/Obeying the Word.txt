Obeying the Word
</h1>
<p>
Obedience to God proves our love for Him (1 John 5:2-3), demonstrates our faithfulness to Him (1 John 2:3-6), glorifies Him in the world (1 Peter 2:12), and opens avenues of blessing for us (John 13:17).</p>
<p>
Faith is necessary to please God (Heb 11:6), and if our faith is genuine and true, we will live a lifestyle characterised by righteousness, modelling the example set for us by Jesus Christ. We obey His commands, not because we have to, but because we want to, because we love Him. We are enabled to obey because, once we believe in Christ and are saved, we are remade. We are not the same people we once were. As Paul wrote <font color= "blue">“If anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation;  old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new.” (2 Cor 5:17)</font></p>
<p>
When we obey the Lord, we can live a life of joy, without shame, rooted deeply in the Lord and confident in our eternal hope. <font color= "blue">“Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty” (2 Cor 3:17).</font> Our obedience is actually part of our assurance that we truly know God (1 John 2:3).</p>
<p>
When God’s children obey their Heavenly Father, He is glorified. Jesus told us that the plan is <font color= "blue">"that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven” (Matt 5:16).</font> Of course, performing “good deeds” requires obedience to the One who calls us to good deeds. A Christian’s testimony of holiness is a strong witness that God is at work in the world.</p>

“Blessed is every one who fears the Lord, who walks in His ways” (Psa 128:1).</font> 
The Bible often tells us that God blesses and rewards obedience. <font color= "blue">“But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. ... But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does.” (James 1:22-25) </font>See also Psa 119:1-2.</p>
<p>
God is gracious. If we haven’t been living for Him, if we haven’t been following His commandments, if we’ve been living in and for the world, we can be transformed by the blood of Jesus Christ. We can ask God for forgiveness, and He will give it. And He will choose to forget the sin, just as if we had never committed it in the first place. God is glorified when He extends forgiveness, because it is written, <font color= "blue">“I will put My laws into their hearts, and in their minds I will write them,” then He adds, “Their sins and their lawless deeds I will remember no more” (Heb 10:16-17).</font></p>
