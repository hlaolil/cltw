  <h1>
Lack of Faith Produces Disobedience
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
Then the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, “Because you did not believe Me, to hallow Me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them". (Num 20:12)</font></p>
<p>
Moses was judged here for not expressing enough faith in God.<br> God had instructed him to speak to the rock, but instead of doing just that he fell back to his comfort zone, repeated what he has done before, which was strike the rock with the rod in his hand. Apparently God read the situation as Moses expression of lack of faith in Him (Num 20:1-13).<p><center>

<p>
From that incident with Moses, we can decipher some signs of unbelief in our own lives that can cost us our Promised Land, as it costs Moses.</p>
<p>
Fear of the  unknown</p>
<p> 
Disobedience</p>
<p>
Moved by men, and not by God</p>
<p>
Projecting yourself, instead of God</p>
<p>
Fear of the unknown</p>
<p>
Acting based on fear is never the right way to go. Paul told Timothy to not be fearful (contrary to faith) (2 Tim 1:6-7), because it takes faith to express the gift of God. Someone might actually pull back from following God fully in faith because of the fear of the unknown. They pulled back from his service, worried what people might think of him. Such a person through fear has disqualified himself from the blessings of following God. God said that Caleb followed Him fully, and he got a personal portion in the Promised Land <br>(Num 4:24, Joshua 14:6-14).</p>
<p>
The children of Israel could not go into the Promised Land because they could not follow God but allowed their fear of the unknown to control them.<br> Some would not go into the relationship that might lead to marriage because of the fear of the unknown, the fear of failure, maybe because of leaning on their past experience, just as Moses did.</p>
<p>
Moses did not do what he was told; he repeated an action that he performed earlier, where he was told to hit the rock with the rod. Maybe it was fear of the unknown that partly caused him to not obey a “strange” new instruction, receding to his comfort zone.</p>
<h3>
Disobedience
</h3>
<p>
This is another sign of lack of faith in God.  Disobedience It is not about merely a moral lapse or but an expression of unbelief. <br>Why did Eve eat the forbidden fruit (Gen 3:1-17)? Was it not because somehow the devil was able to get her to disbelieve the word of God?<br> That sin committed by Moses that deprived him of the Promised Land was maybe he thought he knew more than God, or else why would he not do exactly as he was told? And to make matters worse, though he did not do what he was told, he had results, water still came out of the rock; this means that getting result is never the litmus test that you are in the will of God. </p> 
<p>
Someone wrote that he has put the word of God in his heart so he would not sin against Him (Psa 119:11). In another place we read that faith comes by hearing the word of God (Rom 10:17). Joining the two thoughts together, it is conclusive that faith is important for a life of obedience.</p>
<p>
When we read Heb 11; we see that those marked apart for a life of faith, they were outstanding because of their obedience (their faith made them obedient).  Abel, was obedient to offer the right offering,<br> Abraham was obedience to leave his father’s house. <br>Many of them, we were told that through faith they obeyed God; to disobey God therefore is surely a sign of lack of faith.</p>
<p>
You don’t do what God wants because you don’t think He is serious, or you believe your own assessment of the situation is better than His, or you don’t believe His claim to be the Almighty One, the Supreme One.<br> 
If so you need to acquire a healthy fear of Him which is the beginning of wisdom (Prov 9:10), and act correctly (the definition of wisdom) based on His prescription.</p>
<p>
Why go to a doctor when you don’t believe him enough to follow his prescription?  So, when you don’t get to the promised land of better health you have yourself to blame. If you were asked to make a lifestyle change and you don’t, it means you have more assurance in your own judgement than that of your doctor.</p>
<p>
Saul disobeyed God’s instruction; he did not follow through with it (1 Sam 15). He did not believe that truly it is God who gives him victory and to whom he owes his total allegiance; this is because he listened to the words of his servants instead of following through with the plan of God. And like Moses, he lost the “Promised Land”, because he was rejected by God as king. It is actually interesting that after being rejected by God he still continued as king for decades more. This means being in a position does not mean one has the support of God and does not mean you are there because you are doing things right.</p>
<h3>
Moved by Men and Not by God
</h3>
<p>
Moses exhibited lack of faith because instead of allowing himself to listen to the word of God, he was moved by the words of men. The men were harsh in their complaints against Moses and they had been trying his patience for a long time. And in anger he momentarily lost his spiritual balance falling away from the promise of God, that he would take the children of Israel to the Promised Land, because he disobeyed Him.</p>
<p>
Men don’t just make us angry, they also make us fearful, and both emotions can dampen our faith, reduce the expression of our confidence in God. <br>The bible says that the fear of man leads to a snare (Prov 29:25), and in that snare you will not be able to express the freedom of faith. When we put premium on the word of man, causing anger or fear in ourselves, then we have thrown away our shield of faith and the fiery darts of the enemy can get us down (Eph 6:16).  We throw away the shield of faith because we are distracted by the words of men, rather than focus on God; we are now focused on men. When we are moved by men in fear or in anger, we are moved away from faith, just as Moses was, moved from obedience into error.</p>
<p>
Moses put his emotion before the word of God. The emotions cannot be guides in the walk of faith; it must be the word of God. Strong desire does not mean the way to go; one can have a strong desire to go to the “pit.”</p>
<h3>
Promoting Yourself Instead of God
</h3>
<p>
The words of Moses before he struck the rock against the word of God showed that he wanted to promote himself, instead of God. Faith does not do that.<br> The faith in John the Baptist says that Jesus must increase but he must decrease (John 3:30).  Faith is focused on the glory of God. <br>God accused Moses of not honouring Him before the people, violating His command. The words of Moses before he struck the rock puts it as if it was his own power that he would use to bring out the water maybe so that the people would respect him and stop giving him so much stress. So he used the power of God to his own advantage, and pushed God Himself into the background.</p>
