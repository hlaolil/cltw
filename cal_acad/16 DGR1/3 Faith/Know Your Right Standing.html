Know Your Right Standing

Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence toward God."<br> (1 John 3:21)</font></p>
<p>
Four reasons to obey the word of God because we must meet specific conditions for our prayers to be heard and answered.
<p><font size="+1">
First</font></p>
<p> Notice that the phrase "if our heart does not condemn us" is a reference to God not answering our prayers:<br><font color= "blue"> "If I regard iniquity in my heart, The Lord will not hear." (Psa 66:18).</font> <br> If we have sin in our lives, our hearts will condemn us. So this verse actually combines two potential roadblocks to answered prayer in the same sentence. But if we obey the Lord's word and "our heart does not condemn us" we can confidently ask Him for anything. </p>
<p><font size="+1">
Second</font></p>
<p> John says that the absence of sin results in "confidence toward God". <br>Having "confidence toward God" is a wonderful promise that should fill our hearts with joy!</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Third</font></p>
<p> John summarises his point by saying that a non-condemning heart and confidence before God, is the result of obedience: <br><font color= "blue">"because we keep His commandments and do those things that are pleasing in His sight." (1 John 3:22)</font></p>
<p>
It should come as no surprise that John places such a high priority on obedience. One of the themes of 1 John is "tests of genuine salvation". Throughout the letter John tells us how to know whether or not we are truly saved. If you ever struggle with the issue of assurance of salvation, 1 John is one of the best places in the Bible to find our whether your profession of faith is true or false.</p>
<p>
How do I know whether I'm truly a Christian? Here's the answer:<br>
<font color= "blue">"Now by this we know that we know Him, if we keep His commandments." <br>(1 John 2:3)</font> </p>
<p>
Straightforward. Direct. Simple. No nonsense. That's John's writing style throughout the Gospel of John and his three epistles. And he certainly comes through loud and clear in this verse, doesn't he?
If I live a life of obedience to God's Word, I can know that I know Jesus. Now that's assurance!</p>
<p>
Conversely,<font color= "blue"> "He who says, “I know Him,” and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him." (1 John 2:4)</font> <p>
<p><font size="+1">
Fourth</font></p>
<p> So you say "I'm a Christian. I'm saved. I'm born again. I know Christ as my Saviour and Lord." Great! But anybody can say anything.<br> If you are really a believer, you will prove it by your behaviour, by a life of obedience to the commands of Christ. And no matter what you say you are, if you are not living a life of habitual obedience to God's Word, then your profession is false. <br>In fact, your profession is a lie. Your words don't prove anything.<br> Only your actions enable you to pass the test of genuine conversion and saving faith.</p>
<p>
God only promises to answer the prayers of His people, and His people are those whose lives are characterised by obedience. It's as simple as that.</p>
