Wrecked Faith

<h3>
What it means to Shipwreck Our Faith?
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you may wage the good warfare, having faith and a good conscience, which some having rejected, concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck, of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I delivered to Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme. (1 Tim 1:18-20)</font></p>
<p>
Paul warns Timothy about Hymenaeus and Alexander who were among those who had “shipwrecked their faith” by ignoring the doctrines of the faith and the vital importance of a clear conscience.  He also informs Timothy that <font color= "blue">“the Spirit expressly says that in latter times some will depart from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons,” (1 Tim 4:1).</font></p>
<p>
A person “shipwrecks” his or her faith when he or she stops trusting Jesus.  This is far more than having doubts and questions.  This “shipwreck” is caused by rejecting faith in God and refusing to receive His grace to carry on.  Another word for this is “apostasy.”  Christians who are apostate wilfully choose to live and die without Jesus.<br>

So how can we avoid shipwrecking our faith?</p>
<h3>
Pay Attention to the Details
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Therefore we must give the more earnest heed to the things we have heard, lest we drift away.” (Heb 2:1)</font></p>
<p> 
The figure is that of a ship drifting of course and into danger.  The worries and cares of life may lull us into complacency.  The result would be disastrous.  We need regular doses of Bible study and careful application of God’s truth to our ideas, experiences and behaviours.  We dare not tolerate deliberate disobedience in our lives.</p>
<h3>
Strengthen Your Support Structures
</h3>
<p>
Look for ways to <font color= "blue">“exhort one another daily,” (Heb 3:13).</font>  Pray for each other and help hurting ones to keep moving (Heb 12:13).  We need to help each other trust in God’s grace and to be gracious to others as well (Heb 12:15).</p>
<h3>
Live in COnfident Faith — God’s Grace is More Than Enough
</h3>
<p>
While it is possible to turn away from God and to shipwreck your faith, you don’t need to live in fear.  God is faithful and He will complete what He has begun in you (Phil 1:6) as you continue to trust Him (Col 1:23).  Follow Paul’s example.  <font color= "blue">“I press toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. (Phil 3:14).</font></p>
