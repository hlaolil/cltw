<h1>
Abel's Faith 
</h1>
<p>
The stories of the first act of worship in human history and the first murder are recorded in Gen 4. This follows the account of Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, their disobedience to God, and the entrance of sin into the human race. Death, the judgement pronounced upon them by God, soon made its entrance in the first family.</p>
<p>
Cain and Abel, the sons of Adam and Eve, in the process of time brought offerings to the Lord (Gen 4:3-4). Without doubt, they were doing this because God had revealed it to them. Some question, “How were Cain and Abel supposed to know what to sacrifice?” The answer is that God must have instructed them. It is clear that the offering was to be a substitutionary atonement, because we read <font color= "blue">"By faith Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain did." (Heb 11:4)</font> When Abel came for worship, it was by faith that he brought his offering, the "fat portions from some of the first-born of his flock" (Gen 4:4). The Lord looked with favour on Abel and his offering, and it was accepted.</p>
<p>
His brother Cain brought "some of the fruits of the soil as an offering to the Lord" (Gen 4:3). But on Cain and his offering the Lord did not look with favour. We do not know how He expressed His rejection, but it was evident. In Jude's epistle we read,  <font color= "blue">"they have gone in the way of Cain," (Jude 1:11)</font> referring to lawless men. This may mean that they, like Cain, disobediently devised their own ways of worship; they did not come by faith. Cain’s offering, while acceptable in his own eyes, was not acceptable to the Lord. The result was that Cain became very angry, and later, in the field, he killed his brother Abel (Gen 4:8).</p>
<p>
Why did Cain kill Abel? It was premeditated murder, caused by anger, jealousy, and pride. John wrote, <font color= "blue">"not as Cain who was of the wicked one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his works were evil and his brother’s righteous" (1 John 3:12).</font> The evil in his heart was further revealed <font color= "blue">the Lord said to Cain, “Where is Abel your brother?”" "He said, “I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?" (Gen 4:9).</font> The Lord brought a curse on Cain, and he went out from His presence.
<p>
When Jesus Christ died upon the cross, He became the substitutionary atonement for our sins. He died in our place and arose from the grave that we might have everlasting life with Him. As Abel made his sacrifice by faith, we accept Jesus’ death by faith and are made right before Him. "even the righteousness of God, through faith in Jesus Christ, to all and on all who believe. For there is no difference;" "... being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God set forth as a propitiation by His blood, through faith, ..." (Rom 3:22,24-25).</p>
