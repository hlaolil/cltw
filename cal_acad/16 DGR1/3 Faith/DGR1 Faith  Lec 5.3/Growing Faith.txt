“Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.” (1 Cor 15:58)</font></p>
<p>
In contemplating this verse, it seems the Lord knew we’d be tempted to abandon standing firm and move from the spot where He has placed us. He knew at times we’d fail to give ourselves fully to the work He’s called us to. It is no surprise to Him that we face moments when we are thinking, “This labour I’m doing is in vain. It’s pointless.”</p>
<p>
But thankfully God repeatedly reminds us that our efforts in working for Him are not pointless. We may not see the results we often desire–lives transformed immediately or steady changes we can perceive. But even if we see no results in our outer world, God is doing a work inside us as we continue to obey.</p>
<p>
One area where some battle this is in their prayer life. Recently a friend and I were discussing a difficult situation that affected us both. So I said, “Let’s pray about it.”
This friend voiced the attitude I’ve often battled with when it comes to prayer: “What’s the point? We’ve prayed and prayed about it, and nothing has happened.”</p>
<p>
But as I reflected on my times of prayer over this matter, I realised something had happened in me. When I prayed in a certain way, God’s way, my attitude changed. Bitterness and self-pity melted. I began to see things from God’s perspective. I grew more patient. And I also gave the problem to God. Granted, at times I took it back; but the praying changed me if I let it and as I let go of demanding a specific result of my labouring in prayer.<br>
So whether we feel it’s pointless or not, God has called us and every Christian to the work of prayer:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“men always ought to pray and not lose heart,” (Luke 18:1)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Rejoice always, pray without ceasing,” (1 Thess 5:16-17)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God;” (Phil 4:6)</font></p>
<p>
I have to remind myself often of what Thomas Hooker said, “Prayer is my chief work, and it is by means of it that I carry on the rest.”</p>
<p>
There are countless benefits to doing what God wants us to do, whether it’s reaching out to those less fortunate or praying for seemingly hopeless circumstances. Most are invisible. Some we won’t be aware of until heaven. But we do know this: If we obey, it pleases God and brings Him glory.</p>

That is the point, the whole point.

What about you? Are you believing the “It’s pointless” lie? Bring your frustrations to God and allow Him to transform the way you think and feel. Let Him remind you of the point, the purpose of it all, as you give yourself fully to the work He has called you to.</p>
