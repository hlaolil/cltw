Great Faith

<h3>
Jesus Encounters the Woman of Canaan
</h3>
<p> 
The Lord Jesus has many times rebuked the disciples for their little faith (Matt 8:26; 14:31; 16:8). By contrast, there is one person to whom Jesus said, Great is your faith. And this person turns out to be a Gentile. We are told specifically that she is a Canaanite, a term which has inevitable OT associations with the pagan inhabitants of Palestine. You remember that they were to be exterminated by the Israelites because of their moral corruption. And yet, despite her background, Jesus said to her, "O woman, great is your faith"! But what was great about her faith? What does great faith mean? This will be the topic of this article.

Then Jesus went out from there and departed to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And behold, a woman of Canaan came from that region and cried out to Him, saying, “Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed.”
But He answered her not a word. And His disciples came and urged Him, saying, “Send her away, for she cries out after us.” But He answered and said, “I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”
Then she came and worshipped Him, saying, “Lord, help me!”
But He answered and said, “It is not good to take the children’s bread and throw it to the little dogs.”
And she said, “Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs eat the crumbs which fall from their master's table.”
Then Jesus answered and said to her, “O woman, great is your faith! Let it be to you as you desire.” And her daughter was healed from that very hour. (Matt 15:21-28)</font> </p>
 <h3>
A Gentile woman
 </h3>
<p>
O woman, great is your faith! You know, on Jesus’ words alone, this Canaanite woman  takes a place that is higher than the apostles. Of the twelve apostles, Jesus sometimes said, "O men of little faith". But of this Canaanite, He said, "O woman, great is your faith"!</p>
 <p>
I believe that in the kingdom of God, near the throne where Jesus sits, there will be sitting there not the twelve apostles, not some famous preachers, not some respectable elders, but some unknown persons like this nameless woman of Canaan. There is an encouragement here to the little ones, the obscure, the unnoticed believers. Because you see, this desperate mother was frankly a person who did not deserve much attention. She was a nobody. Women played practically no role in the Jewish society of that time.</p>
 <p>
Then, not only was that person a woman, but she was also a Canaanite. To be a Gentile was bad enough in the eyes of the Jews. To be a Canaanite was even worse.
And if that was not enough, she had a daughter who was tormented by a demon. What was her family doing that her child was in that condition? Children normally are not demon possessed, unless someone in the family was dabbling in spiritualism. This raises some questions about the moral standing of her family.
So here this desperate woman comes to seek Jesus, hoping to find assistance for her daughter who suffered severely. Given the attitude of the Jews to women and especially to Canaanites, she could hardly have expected anything. That she nonetheless appealed to Jesus already indicates an unusual willingness to challenge social convention.</p>
 <h3>
O Lord, Son of David
 </h3>
<p>
Notice that she did not see Jesus simply as some kind of miracle worker. Three times in this passage, she addressed Him as Lord, <i>kyrie</i>. "Lord, have mercy on me" ‘
"Lord, help me." "Yes, Lord." (Matt 15:22,25,27).</p>
 <p>
Was this "Lord" simply a courtesy title that she used to acknowledge Jesus’ social superiority? I don’t think that she was just trying to be polite. Look at Matt 15:22. Not only she addressed Jesus as Lord, but she also addressed Him as the "Son of David." O Lord, Son of David! Anyone who is familiar with the Bible knows that the title "Son of David" is a Jewish title for the Messiah. Amazing. The appeal to Jesus as "Son of David" is striking in the mouth of a Gentile. She clearly had some knowledge of Judaism. Living near to Galilee, she had heard that the Jews expected a Messiah, a son of the great king David, who was to establish an eternal kingdom. God kindled in her heart a true faith in the Messiah. She was convinced that this Jesus, walking around like some ordinary rabbi, was none other than the promised King. And she accepted Him as her Lord.</p>
 <p>
This woman was able to apply her faith into the situation relating to her daughter. She thought, "Since Jesus is the messianic King who will bring salvation, then I can go to Him and say, "Lord, Son of David, you are the promised Messiah, the One who brings hope to the hopeless and salvation to the lost. Have regard for my miserable situation. Help me, please." And that is exactly what she did.</p>
 <h3>
Persistence Despite Apparent Rejection
 </h3>
<p>
Jesus heard the woman’s request but ignored it. He did not speak a word to her (Matt 15:23). This, however, did not dissuade her. She continued to follow after Him and she continued to shout.</p>
 <p>
The disciples began to be annoyed because her behaviour was drawing to them the very attention which they sought to avoid. Jesus did not go to the region of Tyre and Sidon to make Himself public for we read in Mark 7:24 that when He had entered a house, He wanted no one to know of it. The disciples therefore urged Jesus to "send her away." Twelve men could presumably have driven the woman away themselves. Instead they asked Jesus to take action. This suggests that by the words Send her away, they meant, "Do what she wants, so that she will go away."</p>
 <p>
What was implied by Jesus’ silence is put into words in Matt 15:24. I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. This was His calling before His death: first the Jewish people, the house of Israel. The Gentiles would come later. The gospel will be preached to them after His death and resurrection. "I was not sent to you," Jesus said. "I was sent only to those of the house of Israel and you are not of the house of Israel."</p>
 <p>
Instead of being discouraged by Jesus’ apparent unwillingness to respond to her request, she again implored His help. Lord, help me (Matt 15:25). In these three short words, she was saying, "I don’t quite understand what you are talking about when you speak of the limitations of your mission. But I know that you have boundless power. I know that you can heal my daughter. Please, help me." And notice what she did. She bowed down before Him. Matt 15:25: But she came and knelt before him. Not only she called Him Lord, she worshipped Him as Lord.</p>
 <p>
After Jesus’ initial silence in Matt 15:23 and then the statement concerning His personal ministry in Matt 15:24, now His answer seems to add insult to injury. He said, It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs. Jesus made more explicit the restriction stated in Matt 15:24, but He did it by a metaphor which in any culture would be demeaning to those depicted as dogs. Here the dogs are the Gentiles and the children are the Jews. Jesus was saying to the woman, "You, a non-Jew, a dog, must not demand what God has ordained to His children, to the Jews."</p>
 <p>
How did she react to that? "I didn’t expect to hear this kind of language from you. I thought you were better than that. I thought many good things of you. And what do you turn out to be? Just another Jewish narrow-minded bigot!" No, she did not say that. But I think we would have pardoned her if she had done so, wouldn’t we?</p>
 <p>
Her response is disarming. Yes, Lord; but even the dogs feed on the crumbs which fall from their masters' table. "Yes, I’m only a dog. But remember one thing, Lord. Even the dogs get the crumbs that fall from the table. Will you spare me a few crumbs?" All she wanted right then was a few crumbs, or one crumb in particular – one miracle of healing for her daughter.</p>
 <p>
"O woman," Jesus then said, "great is your faith. Be it done to you as you wish. Your request is granted."</p>
 <p>
Jesus was delighted by the faith of the woman. But in what way was her faith great? Was it because she believed that Jesus could heal her daughter? I don’t think so. Remember that crowds came to Jesus to be healed. They believed that He could heal them. Was that great faith? Not necessary. This is certainly not the emphasis of our passage.</p>
 <p>
Notice this. Three times she was being met with apparent rejection. Yet, she still addressed Jesus three times as Lord. She kept following Him despite His silence, despite His statement about the limits of His mission, despite being called a dog. In that sense, she demonstrated an impressive persistence, a persistence that would not quit.</p>
