Jesus Tamed the Elements

On the same day, when evening had come, He said to them, “Let us cross over to the other side.” Now when they had left the multitude, they took Him along in the boat as He was. And other little boats were also with Him. And a great wind storm arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already filling. But He was in the stern, asleep on a pillow. And they awoke Him and said to Him, “Teacher, do You not care that we are perishing?” Then He arose and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Peace, be still!” And the wind ceased and there was a great calm. But He said to them, “Why are you so fearful? How is it that you have no faith”? (Mark 4:35-40)</font></p>
This statement was made on board a boat in the midst of a furious squall that threatened the life of Jesus’ disciples. Did you notice in the text that fear and faith are not compatible? Where fear is tolerated faith cannot exist, they are in opposition to each other. One is of God while the other is of the devil; one has hope while the other has despair. Take note of the question Jesus asked, “Why are you so afraid?” Fear, then, is obviously the reason for no faith. But how was this possible with the Creator and Sustainer of the universe in the same situation? </p>

Jesus our Saviour and Redeemer

Their problem was that they had accepted His Messiahship, but had an inadequate view of the same. They had not recognised all the implications that His office of Messiah carried with it. They failed to see Him as the cause and goal of all that exists, the embodiment of full deity, the Lord of creation and the sustainer of all things. They failed to see that all things, including the raging storm, were subservient to Him. In  it says of Him:<font color= "blue">
For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him. And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist. (Col 1:16-17)</font></p>
<p>
He is exalted over, rules, and sustains all things. If not for Him everything would go back to nothing.
So herein is the reason why the disciples had no faith. They trusted Christ to save them, but did not recognise His ongoing ministry to them. Many people have accepted Jesus Christ as their Saviour, but fail to become familiar with all that His work as Saviour embodies. He not only saves from sin, but He also heals, provides, protects, and delivers, among other things. It is therefore necessary, if we are to find the solution to cure the ailment of no faith, to know Jesus in His several redemptive roles. When we do our faith matures to a more perfected state.</p>
