"Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning" (James 1:17)</font></p>
<p>
God never changes. In fact, it is impossible for God to change. The influences that cause change in your life have no effect on God. He will never be stronger or weaker. His knowledge and wisdom will not increase or diminish. God does not compromise or change His values. And God does not have mood swings. Life and its uncertainties may shake you, but God-the Rock of Ages-does not move. If you cling to Him, His strength will sustain you.</p>
<p>
God's unchanging purpose gives you eternal significance. <font color= "blue"> "The counsel of the Lord stands forever, The plans of His heart to all generations." (Psa 33:11)</font> God's plan is unchangeable. It existed at the beginning of creation and remains the same today. And you are part of His plan! Paul explains, <font color= "blue">"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them." (Eph 2:10).</font></p>
<p>
God's unchangeable ways assure you of unwavering guidance.  <font color= "blue">"As for God, His way is perfect; the word of the Lord is proven;" (Psa 18:30)</font> God's principles for life never change. His guidelines, given in Scripture, produce fruitful lives when you follow them.</p>
<p>
God's unchanging Word equips you with timeless truth. Isaiah declared, <font color= "blue">"The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God stands forever" (Isa 40:8).</font> God's words and commands are timeless.</p>
<p>
God's unchanging commitment guarantees everlasting security. If you have trusted in Jesus Christ as your Lord and Saviour, you can be assured of eternal life. God is eternally committed to your redemption, your spiritual growth, and your eternal destiny. God's commitment to you is as strong as He is eternally constant. The storms of life are continually changing, but God remains the same. He is consistent and reliable. He is your anchor. You can count on God because He never changes.</p>
