Our New Lives
</h3>
<p>
For those who use computers or smart phones, an illustration might help. Our new life functions similar to a brand new operating system for a computer device. Each computer uses an operating device as the underlying software which provides the many basic functions of the computer. The applications or programs use this operational system to carry out the purposes of their applications. Our bodies are like that computer. It doesn’t change but only gets older. When we become a believer, it gains a new operating system. Our bodies, then, like a computer, runs by this new system. The old one can be reinstalled, but one can only operate by one operating system at a time.</p>
<p>
The new life that the Lord has given to us is not just an upgrade from a previous system. No, no. The new life is a completely new operating system for our lives and, in fact, runs contrary to the former one, the old man. This is grand news.<p>
<h3>
Clarifying and Affirming Our Identity in Christ
</h3>
<p>
We do not need to live the old way of life, focused on fulfilling our needs filled with anger, wrath, curses and sensuality, but according to the new life in Christ, which focuses on serving God and others. This is the reason we speak of our new identity. It is not just the improved us, but a radically different us because of Christ living in us.</p> 
<p>
“and have put on the new man who is renewed in knowledge according to the image of Him who created him, where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised nor uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave nor free, but Christ is all and in all” (Col 3:10-11).</p>
<h3>
Five Christian Life Facts
</h3>
<p>
Here are five Christian growth facts that Paul uses to explain various aspects of this great redemptive plan of God.
All Christian believers have a new self (as in contrary to the old self).</p>
<p>
1. Have put on the new self<br>
The original Greek word Paul used for self is really man or person. Just as our old self animated our old being–the old sinful life, along with its selfish desires and abilities, so now Christ’s Spirit brings life to our new person.</p> 
<p>
2. The life or power of the new self can be strengthened.</p>
<p>
3. This new self is purposed or destined to be like its Creator (image of One who created Him).</p>
<p>
4. This renewal is the same for all Christian believers, no matter our religious backgrounds, educational level, economical standing, cultural awareness or association or even if one is at a cultural caste or state.</p>
<p>
5. We all develop together into Christ’s fullness (i.e. body grows)</p>
<p>
These words speaking of a new self are not empty words but summarise the new life activity soaring through all the lives of all believers, ushering us all towards the same goal of Christ’s likeness. Christ Jesus Himself is animating us closer and closer to God. But if we, live in unbelief and think things not according to the truth, then we will end up very confused, resulting in tragic lives. The Lord now lives in our lives to carry out His ways and plans.
<h3>
Summary
</h3>
<p>
These are some powerful truths, all hold great implications for our lives. If we do not know or believe the importance of these things, then we will sense a great tension in our lives. We will ask, “Why does our faith not work? What is wrong?” </p>
<p>
This is the reason discipleship is so important because it gets us all, at an early stage of Christian life, to the same mindset of understanding God’s purpose in our lives. Discipleship helps young believers learn how to live out Christ’s life. Without this training, we will face enormous misunderstandings of God, the gospel, and our life, thus causing much misunderstanding, making us even more susceptible to the evil one’s devious devices.</p>
