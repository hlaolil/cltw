  <h1>
We Cannot Please God Without Faith
</h1>
<h3>
Faith is Trusting God
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him. (Heb 11:6)</font></p>
<p>
To understand this verse we first have to understand that faith is “trust.”<br> Once we understand that, we can understand why it is impossible to please God without faith. If we could please God without faith, we could please God without trusting Him. Have you ever had someone distrust you? Have you ever had someone you had helped again and again distrust you? That is a very painful experience.</p>
<p>
No one has given more, loved more, or done more for people than God. <br>He is constantly loving and helping people, and even sent His only begotten Son to be tortured and killed for us. If after all He has done, someone still does not trust that He exists and that He rewards those who seek Him, then God is not pleased with that person. God cannot help and bless the person the way He would like to, and the person will not be able to love God and work for Him as he should. That is not to say that God is not pleased when an unbeliever starts to seek God and his faith is building. Of course He is pleased with that.<br> Scripture tells us that,<font color= "blue"> “... there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance” <br>(Luke 15:7).</font></p>
<p>
Christians need to take Heb 11:6 seriously, because our God did create the heavens and the earth, and He did send His Son, and He will give everlasting life to those who are saved. It is “politically correct” in these times to pray to “God” as long as it is not specifically to the Christian God. God has given us free will, and people can choose not to believe, but we Christians must be honest and up front about the fact that persistent unbelief displeases God.</p>
<h3>
God Wants Us to Trust and Appreciate Him
</h3>
<p>
When it comes to wanting to be trusted and appreciated, God is no different from the rest of us, which makes sense, because we are created in His image. Let’s say someone works very hard to be the hostess and prepare for a friend’s party. She makes calls, decorates, arranges entertainment, and bakes desserts. But when the party is going full steam, the guest of honour gives all the credit to someone else. Would the hostess be hurt? Surely. Displeased? Certainly.<br> That is what happens in God’s heart when we give credit for what He has done to evolution, or other gods, or pray to other gods, or to a “God” that is politically correct but is not actually the true God. <br>Christians are “ambassadors” (2 Cor 5:20) for God and His Son. <br>So Christians should do all they can to build and maintain their faith, and also boldly and lovingly defend their faith in God when the opportunity presents itself.</p>
<p>
Also, Christians must realise that faith is the key to receiving many of the blessings and promises of God. God wants Christians to have faith so He can bless us. What would prevent us from having faith? Why would we not trust God? Christians must guard against mental laziness or anything else that stands in the way of receiving all the blessings of God, and be willing to press forward, ever growing in the Lord. God has so much He wants to give us, let’s do our part and trust Him so the windows of heaven are open to us.</p>
