The Elements
</h1>
<p>
No one but God can control the Elements as we can see from the following nine examples from Scripture:
<p><i><font size="+1">1</i></font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“then I will give you the rain for your land in its season, the early rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, your new wine, and your oil. And I will send grass in your fields for your livestock, that you may eat and be filled.” (Deut 11:14-15)</font></p>
<p>
God sends rains in their proper seasons. This is indicative of the steps of our life being ordered by the Lord. (Psa 37:23) It is leading us to His Goodness and Faithfulness according to His Plan that does not change even when His People do. If you want God’s Best for your life, you will find it His Way. If I plant flowers in the middle of summer and expect it to rain, I am being silly. But if I plant them in spring when showers are expected, then I am using knowledge and understanding that has become wisdom.</p> 
<p>
If you are living in the past immersed in sin, how will God ever make it to you? He cannot tolerate it. But if you repent stepping out of sin and darkness into His Light, His Blessing can be found. It sounds so simple but many are caught in the drought of life because they do not understand the importance of God’s Way or His Timing. Like living in the natural ignoring the spiritual will result in reaping and sowing without God’s Favour, simply living in His Provision. But for those who choose to live in God’s Kingdom led by His Spirit, there is an interesting development in obedience.</p>
<p><i><font size="+1">2</i></font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“If you walk in My statutes and keep My commandments, and perform them, then I will give you rain in its season, the land shall yield its produce, and the trees of the field shall yield their fruit. Your threshing shall last till the time of vintage, and the vintage shall last till the time of sowing; you shall eat your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely". (Lev 26:3-5)</font></p>
<p>
Obedience brings about a change of season when one is preparing for an outpouring of God’s Spirit. Through knowing God’s Word and doing it, the seasons begin to overlap and now you can live in a continual, perpetual season of God’s Favour and Prosperity. Harvest overlaps with planting and there is always provision. You will eat your fill and live securely. With a struggling economy most families have been forced to budget and save to survive, but for those who live in an outpouring of God’s Spirit – there is no famine or drought just perpetual prosperity. Obedience is the key!</p>
<p><i><font size="+1">3</i></font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
You visit the earth and water it, You greatly enrich it; The river of God is full of water; You provide their grain, for so You have prepared it. You water its ridges abundantly, You settle its furrows; You make it soft with showers, You bless its growth. (Psa 65:9-10)</font></p>
<p>
For those not quite ready for such abundance, God will use the rain to prepare us for fertility and develop our faith. His Faithfulness never leaves you in settlement but provokes you to His Best. Satisfaction is elusive for one who is thirsty until the need is met. Contentment can be found no other way for the one whose heart is after God. No matter how many substitutes we accept, eternity has been placed in our heart (Eccl 3:11) so superficial, temporary things do not work. Do you need some rain to break up your hardened heart?<br> God will drench you, if you only ask. He will pour out His Spirit preparing you to receive His Very Best. He loves you that much!</p>
<p><i><font size="+1">4</i></font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
You, O God, sent a plentiful rain, whereby You confirmed Your inheritance, when it was weary. (Psa 68:9)</font></p>
<p>
An outpouring of the Spirit of God will refresh your weary land. It will restore your soul. Relieve desperation. Revive devastation. Don’t run from the rain but step into it today. This world has nothing for you. It will never satisfy you. <br>It cannot find contentment. God has everything you need!</p>
<p><i><font size="+1">5</i></font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
As they pass through the Valley of Baca, they make it a spring; the rain also covers it with pools. (Psa 84:6)</font></p>
<p>
Whatever you are going through today has hidden blessings. The problem is we cannot find them through our tears sometimes. God has provided His Spirit to be our Comforter. By His Spirit, we discover the refreshing springs and restoring rain God has provided through Jesus Christ to all of His People.<br> Do not stop walking or run away from the storm just keep your faith and walk through it – there are blessings there.</p>
<p><i><font size="+1">6</i></font></font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Then He will give the rain for your seed with which you sow the ground, and bread of the increase of the earth; it will be fat and plentiful. In that day your cattle will feed in large pastures. (Isa 30:23)</font></p>
<p>
Rain is reserved for planting time. If you are not ready to sow and reap, then rain will wash away your preparation. It is for an appointed time. <br><font color= "blue">“For the earth which drinks in the rain that often comes upon it, and bears herbs useful for those by whom it is cultivated, receives blessing from God; but if it bears thorns and briers, it is rejected and near to being cursed, whose end is to be burned.”(Heb 6:7-8)</font> <br>It cannot be any more plain than that. Only those preparing to harvest and planting seeds of faith will see productivity in the rainy season. <br>Otherwise the field is useless. Do not allow your life to be wasted by a lack of productivity. Plant seeds of faith found in the Word of God, His Will and His Way. Then when the rain comes you will be blessed!
This is how to make God’s Blessings rain in your life:</p>
<p><i><font size="+1">7</i></font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Now, therefore,” says the Lord, “Turn to Me with all your heart, with fasting, with weeping, and with mourning.” So rend your heart, and not your garments; return to the Lord your God, for He is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness; and He relents from doing harm. Who knows if He will turn and relent,and leave a blessing behind Him— a grain offering and a drink offering for the Lord your God? (Joel 2:12-14)</font><p>
<p>
Repentance is the turning point when sin no longer keeps us from God’s Best. Our lives have the potential to become productive. It will open the windows of Heaven for you! No longer is there a barrier between you and the blessings God has reserved for you.</p>
<p><i><font size="+1">8</i></font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Be glad then, you children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God;!<br> For He has given you the former rain faithfully, and He will cause the rain to come down for you—
The former rain, and the latter rain in the first month. <br>The threshing floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall overflow with new wine and oil. (Joel 2:23-24)</font></p>
<p>
Now that you access to God’s Presence, allow the Lord to begin to restore your life by remaining in the overflow He is sending. His Love is amazing.<br> It is definitely overwhelming. As God demonstrates His Faithfulness, decide in your heart to remain faithful to the Lord as well. It is in this place you will experience total restoration that will then become prosperity!<p>
<p><i><font size="+1">9</i></font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“And it shall come to pass after wards that I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh;
Your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions. And also on My menservants and on My maidservants I will pour out My Spirit in those days.” (Joel 2:28-29)</font></p>
<p>
Once you tap into the Kingdom of God and receive the overflow of God’s Spirit in your life – look out. You are about to experience a flood of all the provision, blessing, promise, prosperity and favour that Your Father has been keeping safe for you as you found your way back to Him. Now He can release His Full Potential in your life. You will be blown away. His Love will sweep you off your feet like a swift current carrying you faithfully through all the Goodness that He has.<br> Ask the Lord to rain in your life today. (Zech 10:1) Be prepared and pray for it. (James 5:17-18) Wait for it until it comes, it will be worth it. (James 5:7-8) Make it rain!</p>
<p>
 These teachings are good and beneficial for everyone.</p>
