Salvation
</h2>
<p>
The doctrine of salvation by faith in Jesus Christ alone means that no one can, through human effort, become "good enough" to merit eternal life.  Only the merits of the God-Man, Jesus Christ, applied to a sinner's spiritually bankrupt account, will make that person worthy to stand before a holy God in the final Judgement.  Christ paid the penalty for sin when He shed His blood on the Cross.  Salvation is granted to those who place their faith in Jesus Christ alone rather than in their own merits.</po>
 <p>
This is the way of salvation that is set forth by God in Scripture, as opposed to the inadequate human methods of trying to be good through personal effort and/or obeying the man made rules of a religious organisation.  The Bible states that God has made this way of salvation open to all who come to Christ in faith.</p>
 <p>
The doctrine of salvation by faith alone is sometimes misconstrued as permission to live as one pleases with a guarantee of heaven as long as one holds to a mental belief in Christ.  This is not saving faith.  Correctly understood, the Scriptures teach that through faith in Christ a person becomes a child of God with a new nature that enables him/her to live a holy life.  Without the new birth, it is impossible to do the works that truly please God.  For this reason, Jesus said, <font color= "blue">“Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.” (John 3:3)</font></p>
<p> 
In Scripture, God's plan of salvation is presented in Paul's letter Rom 3-5.</p> 
<p> 
Salvation is not a matter of performing an outward religious act but rather a matter of inward repentance for sin and receiving by faith God's forgiveness and gift of eternal life.  If you too will sincerely repent of your sins, you may trust that the blood of Jesus will cover all of your sins and that Christ's righteousness will imputed to you.  God has promised in many places in the Bible that He will not refuse any who come to Him in this way.</p>
<p> <font color= "blue">
The Lord is near to those who have a broken heart, and saves such as have a contrite spirit. (Psa 34:18)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
For thus says the High and Lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy:“I dwell in the high and holy place, with him who has a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.  (Isa 57:15)</font></p>
<p>
Let us then joyfully accept His salvation, look for all our happiness from Him, and devote our selves to His service. Let us glorify Him with our bodies and spirits, which are His; by obeying His commandments, following His example, recommending Him and His salvation, by word and deed, to all around us.</p>

The Holy Spirit
</h2>
<p>
An important verse in understanding the filling of the Holy Spirit is where Jesus promised the Spirit would indwell believers and that the indwelling would be permanent. (John 14:16) It is important to distinguish the indwelling from the filling of the Spirit. The permanent indwelling of the Spirit is not for a select few believers, but for all believers. There are a number of references in Scripture that support this conclusion. </p>
<p>
First, the Holy Spirit is a gift given to all believers in Jesus without exception, and no conditions are placed upon this gift except faith in Christ (John 7:37-39).</p> 
<p>
Second, the Holy Spirit is given at the moment of salvation (Eph 1:13). Gal 3:2 emphasises this same truth, saying that the sealing and indwelling of the Spirit took place at the time of believing. </p>
<p>
Third, the Holy Spirit indwells believers permanently. The Holy Spirit is given to believers as a down payment, or verification of their future glorification in Christ (2 Cor 1:22; Eph 4:30).</p>
<p>
This is in contrast to the filling of the Spirit referred to in (Eph 5:18). We should be so completely yielded to the Holy Spirit that He can possess us fully and, in that sense, fill us. He dwells within every believer, (Rom 8:9; Eph 1:13-14) but He can be grieved (Eph 4:30), and His activity within us can be quenched (1 Thess 5:19). When we allow this to happen, we do not experience the fullness of the Spirit's working and His power in and through us. </p>
<p>
To be filled with the Spirit implies freedom for Him to occupy every part of our lives, guiding and controlling us. Then His power can be exerted through us so that what we do is fruitful to God. The filling of the Spirit does not apply to outward acts alone; it also applies to the innermost thoughts and motives of our actions. <font color= "blue">"Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in Your sight, O Lord, my strength and my Redeemer." (Psa 19:14)</font></p>
<p>
Sin is what hinders the filling of the Holy Spirit, and obedience to God is how the filling of the Spirit is maintained. We are commanded to be filled with the Spirit; (Eph 5:18) however, it is not praying for the filling of the Holy Spirit that accomplishes the filling. Only our obedience to God's commands allows the Spirit freedom to work within us. Because we are still infected with sin, it is impossible to be filled with the Spirit all of the time. When we sin, we should immediately confess it to God and renew our commitment to being Spirit-filled and Spirit-led.</p>

Healing
</h2>
<h3>
What is Divine Healing and is it for Today?
</h3>
<p>
Divine healing is the act of God through the person of Jesus and the prayers of the saints where a person is healed physically and/or delivered from emotional, mental, or spiritual affliction. Most often, it is seen as a physical healing of sickness such as cancer, diseases, deformities, etc., but it is not restricted to the physical.</p>
<p>
Sometimes such healings are accompanied by rituals such as specified prayers and fasting, and often by anointing the sick with oil. The one who is afflicted is supposed to faithfully trust and expect a healing to occur as he or she prays to God in Jesus' name. In all Christian groups that seek divine healing, it is always associated with the atoning work of Christ where, it is said, He purchased healing for us. So, those church groups that emphasise divine healing also emphasise the idea that the redemption of the soul also purchased redemption of the flesh which includes healing. Some of the verses used in support of this doctrine are as follows:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; The chastisement for our peace was upon Him, And by His stripes we are healed." (Isa 53:5)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"When evening had come, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed. And He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick, 17 that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying: “﻿﻿He Himself took our infirmities and ﻿﻿ bore our sicknesses." (Matt 8:16-17)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness—by whose stripes you were healed." (1 Peter 2:24)</font> </p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing psalms. Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven." (James 5:14-15)</font></p>
<p>
Jesus did buy us healing while on the cross, because in the resurrection all of our infirmities will be healed. But this does not mean God owes us healings right now. After all, there's always going to be one ailment we never recover from, and that is our last one.</p>
<p>
Furthermore, sometimes God does not heal us for our benefit. I think we can make the case that when we are suffering but praising God through it, keeping our eyes on him and exalting his holy and precious name, that this brings great glory to God. He is worthy of our praise, and our adoration of him should not depend on our circumstances or our personal condition. He is always worthy of worship. So, our ailments which are not healed in this lifetime can be the things that show us what we are made of before God. It could be that enduring an ailment is something God desires for us because it glorifies him more, and it could bring us greater rewards in heaven. After all, the eternal aspect of things is more important than the temporal.</p>
<h3>
Expect Healing According to God's Will
</h3>
<p>
Not everything we ask for in prayer will be accomplished the way we want. I'm thankful that God has not answered all of my prayers according to my desires. I can look back in life and recognise some bad choices that I'm glad didn't go my way at the time. The same thing goes with healing. We don't know what is best for us, but God does.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us." (1 John 5:14)</font></p>
<p>
God wants us to pray and ask great things of Him, but we must always ask in accordance with His will. We must always seek to desire what God desires. Now, there are those who would say that God has promised us healing in the atonement, and that God desires for all to be healthy. But, this is simply not the case. When we look to Scripture we can find that it is not always God's will to heal somebody. Take Paul the apostle for example:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
And lest I should be exalted above measure by the abundance of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I be exalted above measure. Concerning this thing I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might depart from me. And He said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. (2 Cor 12:7-9)</font></p>
<p>
Now, there's a lot of debate on what the thorn in the flesh is, but it could be what Paul refers to here:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Brethren, I urge you to become like me, for I became like you. You have not injured me at all. You know that because of physical infirmity I preached the gospel to you at the first. And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise or reject, but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus. (Gal 4:12-14)</font></p>
<p>
Whatever the thorn in the flesh was, apparently the apostle Paul was not healed physically according to his desires. So, if the apostle Paul was not healed are we to say we are better than he, or had more faith, and we should be healed? Of course not.</p>
<p>
But, let me say again, we serve a loving God who wants the best for us. He does not enjoy our suffering and He most certainly sympathises with it. Our prayers, in the humility of our suffering, can break our hearts to a deeper fellowship and dependence on God. In our dependence, we ask God to heal us and we can have the confidence that He can heal and that He may very well do that for us. Remember, our faith is only as good as that which we put it in, and we put it in God. It's a great faith, and great faith often results in miracles.</p>
