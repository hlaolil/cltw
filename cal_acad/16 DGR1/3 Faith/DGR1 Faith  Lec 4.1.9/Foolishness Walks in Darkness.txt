Foolishness Walks in Darkness

<h3>
Results of the Lack of Knowledge
</h3>
<p>
“The wise man's eyes are in his head, but the fool walks in darkness” (Eccl 2:14)</p>
<p>
The fact is, the ignorant person doesn’t know that he is ignorant. He doesn’t have enough information to prove to himself otherwise. Nothing shines a light on the uneducated person’s ignorance. For many, the lack of knowledge becomes a source of pride. In speaking about making plans for the future when we don’t know what the future holds, James states,<font color= "blue"> “But now you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil” (James 4:16).</font> To make plans without adequate knowledge is arrogance because we are assuming we have more control over the future than we do.</p>
<p>
The arrogance of ignorance often leads to fights. <font color= "blue">“It is honourable for a man to stop striving, since any fool can start a quarrel” (Prov 20:3). </font> An ignorant person doesn’t see things from another point of view. He assumes his point of view is the only correct one that exists. Put several such people in a room and it would not be long before a conflict arises.</p>
<p>
The ignorant person focuses only on the present and doesn’t consider the future consequences of his actions. <font color= "blue">“A prudent man foresees evil and hides himself, but the simple pass on and are punished” (Prov 22:3).</font> He is unaware of possibilities beyond his own knowledge and, thus, never seeks out alternatives. Nor is he watchful for dangers since he is unaware that they might exist.</p>
<h3>
Lack of Knowledge is Dangerous and Foolish
</h3>
<p>
Solomon describes what happened to one naive young man in Prov 7:6-27. He was caught in the prostitute’s snare because he was unaware of the danger. <font color= "blue">“He did not know it would cost his life” (Prov 7:23).</font> I have had parents tell me that they didn’t want certain matters, such as sexual sins, to be discussed with their children, even those past puberty. I can understand the desire to hang onto the past and strive to preserve the innocence of our children.</p>
<p> 
But Satan isn’t stopped by ignorance. Ignorance will not keep a child out of his traps. Let me illustrate: suppose you are strolling through a field. Would you be grateful if a passer-by shouted out, “Don’t you know you are walking through a mine field?” Or, would you rather not know and continue your stroll in ignorance? Knowledge can be a two-edged sword, but the lack of knowledge is far more dangerous. Parents need to protect their children from temptation, not information.</p>
<h3>
The Gospel is Spread through Knowledge
</h3>
<p>
Finally, for the Christian, we must keep in mind that the Gospel cannot be spread through ignorance. <font color= "blue">“Now the purpose of the commandment is love from a pure heart, from a good conscience, and from sincere faith, from which some, having strayed, have turned aside to idle talk, desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say nor the things which they affirm” (1 Tim 1:5-8).</font> Christianity is spread by teaching (Matt 28:18-20).</p>
