  <h1>
The Power of the Name of Jesus
</h1>
<h3>
The Power of a Name
</h3>
<p>
The name of Jesus is so powerful that ignorance of it is robbing many of God’s blessings and fulfilment in life. The enemy will do anything to keep man in the dark so that he can continue to oppress him. The truth is that the power in the name of Jesus brings deliverance from all oppressions of the devil and delivers dominion to mankind.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved." (Acts 4:12)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
And His name, through faith in His name, has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. (Acts 3:16)</font></p>
<p>
God understanding the power of names carefully chose the name of Jesus to reflect His purpose while on earth and after resurrection.<br> The name of Jesus means Saviour</p>
<h3>
Salvation Means
</h3>
<p>
Deliverance from sin and its consequences.<br>
Preservation or deliverance from harm, ruin, or loss.<br>
Therefore, there is no deliverance from sin and its consequences nor preservation or deliverance from harm, ruin, or loss except through the name of Jesus.
For you to enjoy the benefits, including healing in the name of Jesus you need to understand the power in the name.</p>
<h3>
What there is to Know about the Name Jesus
</h3>
<p><font size="+1">
1. His Name gives us our Identity</font></p>
<p>
<font color= "blue">“And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.”  (Acts 11:26)</font><br>
As a Christian, you are identified with God because you believe in the name of Jesus and are expected to live like Him
<p><font size="+1">
2. Jesus’ Name is Above every Other Name</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father (Phil 2:9-11)</font><br>
The name of Jesus is above the name of any sickness or disease or situation. Whatever has a name is below the name of Jesus and must give way to it, no matter where it may come from: heaven, earth or hell.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
3. Only Through His Name can You Ask any Thing of God</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"And in that day you will ask Me nothing. Most assuredly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give you. Until now you have asked nothing in My name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full."<br> (John 16:23-24)</font><br>
God has designed it that after the death and resurrection of Jesus, no man can relate with Him for any reason whatsoever except through Jesus. He is now the gateway to God and His blessings: you can only go in and get your blessings, including healing through Him.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
4. All Authority is in Jesus' Name</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; they will take up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it will by no means hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover." (Mark 16:17-18)</font><br>
Whatever Jesus can do, the power in the name will do it when you use it. Whatever God can do you can do in the name of Jesus. You can say – let there be in Jesus name and there will be. We exercise our God-given authority only in the name of Jesus.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
5. His Name is Always at Work </font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. Amen. And I have the keys of Hades and of Death." (Rev 1:18)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” Amen. (Matt 28:20)</font></p>
<p>
Because Jesus lives forever and He is with us always, His name is never on break. Look for Him, or call Him at any time, anywhere and the power in the name will work.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
6. The Enemy knows the Power of Jesus' Name</font></p>
<p>
He trembles at the name Jesus.<br>
<font color= "blue">"And suddenly they cried out, saying, “What have we to do with You, Jesus, You Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?” (Matt 8:29)</font><br>
The devils trembled at the presence of Jesus. They still tremble at the name of Jesus.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
And she did this for many days. But Paul, greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.”<br> And he came out that very hour. (Acts 16:18)</font><br>
Command healing or deliverance over your life or loved one in the name of Jesus and the spirit of infirmity will leave immediately.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
7. The Name of Jesus is a Strong Refuge</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
The name of the Lord is a strong tower: the righteous run to it, and are safe. (Prov 18:10)</font><br>
The power in the name provides protection, covering for them that believe in it. When you call His name in time of danger, Jesus quickly shields you from any imminent evil.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
8. His Name Commands Instant Delivery.</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
And Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus the Christ heals you. Arise and make your bed.” Then he arose immediately. (Acts 9:34)</font><br>

When you call His name for help, the answer is dispatched immediately.<br> Most of the time you see instant manifestation but some other times you see the result after a while as you walk in obedience to God’s word.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
9. The Power in the Name of Jesus is Invoked through Faith</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
And His name, through faith in His name, has made this man strong, whom you see and know. Yes, the faith which comes through Him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all. (Acts 3:16)</font><br>

If you call Jesus’ name in unbelief or carelessly, it will not work. Therefore, any time you mention Jesus’ name do it in faith and with the understanding of the power that lies in His name. Don’t call His name in vain; it is not acceptable to God.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
10. You may use His name Only if you are Born Again</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists took it upon themselves to call the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, “We exorcise you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches.” Also there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did so. And the evil spirit answered and said, “Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?” Then the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. This became known both to all Jews and Greeks dwelling in Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.  (Acts 19:13-17)</font></p>
<p>
It is very dangerous to use the name of Jesus if you have not identified with Him. You have to give your life to Jesus first before you can exercise the power in the name.</p>
<p>
In conclusion, there is healing, deliverance amongst other things in the name of Jesus. With all you have read above, you are now in a better position to exercise authority over that illness or situation in Jesus name.
