<h1>
The Seed
</h1>
<p>\
The Word of God often refers to itself as a seed. There are a total of forty four verses in the New Testament where the Greek word <i>sperma</i> was translated “seed.” This is the same word from which we derive our English word “sperm.”
To conceive and give birth, whether it’s for a miracle you need in your body or for the vision God has given you, you must first plant God’s Word like a seed in your heart. Conception, which eventually produces the fruit, cannot take place without first planting a seed.</p>
<h3>
Frustrated Christians
</h3>
<p>
I constantly meet Christians who pray and believe for God’s intervention in their lives, but remain frustrated with their results. Why? Because they have never conceived their miracles by planting the seed of God’s Word in their hearts. That’s like a woman who prays to get pregnant and then is confused when it doesn’t come to pass even though she has never had a relationship with a man. The seed has to be planted for conception to take place.</p>
<p>
In Mark 4, the Lord taught three parables that illustrate that the Word is to the kingdom of God what a natural seed is to a harvest. The first of these parables, the story of the sower, is the key to unlocking all the others <font color= "blue">And He said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables? The sower sows the word. And these are the ones by the wayside where the word is sown. When they hear, Satan comes immediately and takes away the word that was sown in their hearts. These likewise are the ones sown on stony ground who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with gladness; and they have no root in themselves, and so endure only for a time. Afterwards, when tribulation or persecution arises for the word’s sake, immediately they stumble. Now these are the ones sown among thorns; they are the ones who hear the word, and the cares of this world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful. But these are the ones sown on good ground, those who hear the word, accept it, and bear fruit: some thirtyfold, some sixty, and some a hundred.” (Mark 4:13-20).</font> 
<h3>
Process of Seed Time and Harvest
</h3>
<p>
If we don’t understand these truths, Jesus said, we won’t understand any of His other parables.
There are many life changing truths in these parables, but one fact must be understood to get the full benefit of this teaching: The Lord used the comparison of His Word to a law of nature, which is unchangeable, not an institution of man.
Here’s what I mean: Nearly all systems that people have created can be cheated or manipulated. The legal system can be beaten, letting the guilty go free. The educational system can be beaten, passing students who haven’t really learned the material. But the process of seed time and harvest can’t be changed.
What if a farmer waited until he saw his neighbours reaping their crops before he sowed his seed?
Regardless of how sincere he was or the justification for not sowing his seed at the proper time, he would not reap a crop overnight. The law of seed time and harvest cannot be violated.</p>
This is why our Lord chose to compare the way His Word works to a seed. The germination process of the Word of God in your life takes time and can’t be avoided.
In the second parable of Mark 4, <font color= "blue">He said, “The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground,and should sleep by night and rise by day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he himself does not know how. For the earth yields crops by itself: first the blade, then the head, after that the full grain in the head. But when the grain ripens, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come.” (Mark 4:26­29).</font></p>
The seed is the Word of God (Mark 4:14), and the ground is our hearts (Mark 4:15). Our hearts were created by God to bring forth fruit when His Word is planted in them. Just as a seed has to remain in the ground over time to germinate, so the Word of God has to abide in us.
Jesus said:<font color= "blue">
“If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you.” (John 15:7)</font></p>

What would happen if you planted a seed in your garden and then dug it up each morning to see if anything was happening? It would die and never produce fruit. You have to have faith that the seed is doing what God created it to do.
Some people put God’s Word in their hearts for a day or two, but if they don’t see fruit almost immediately, they dig up the seed through their words and actions and wonder why it didn’t work. It must be left in the ground over time. Then, there are also different stages of growth.
<font color= "blue">“First the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear.” (Mark 4:28)</font></p>
<p>
Many people are impatient, wanting to bypass the growth cycle and get the full ear right now. I’ve actually had to tell people what they were believing God for was not going to happen, not because the vision wasn’t good, but because they were expecting a complete ear of corn immediately.</p>
There has to be “first the blade, then the head, after that the full grain in the head.”</p>
<p>You may think that was too harsh, but it was the truth. <br>
God’s kingdom operates on laws, like the laws that govern the fruit bearing process of a seed. God will not give you the full ear of corn if you haven’t seen the first blade. That’s the way God’s kingdom works.
This is precisely the reason most people don’t see God’s best come to pass in their lives. They have lottery faith. They think that since God loves them, He will just grant their request regardless of whether they put the miracle of the seed to work or not.</p>
<p>
I cannot tell you strongly enough how important it is that you know God’s Word and that you plant the
seed of His Word in your heart long before you need the fruit of the harvest. It could mean the difference
between prosperity and poverty, or even life and death.</p>
