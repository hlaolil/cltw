<h1>
A Look at the Biblical Fool
</h1>
<p>
When we think of “fool” we may think of someone silly.  Perhaps we envision a jester in the king’s court, or someone going around doing stupid and silly things. This is not necessarily the biblical picture of a fool.<br>  In the scripture, fools are self-confident (Prov 28:26);<br> self-centred (Luke 12:20);<br> full of words (Eccl 10:14);<br> they vent their anger (Prov 29:11). <br> They are slanderers (Prov 10:18);<br> they rage (Prov 14:16);<br> and are clamorous (Prov 9:13).<br> A very good description of a fool is: “the fool speaks folly, his mind is busy with evil; He practices ungodliness and spreads error concerning the Lord; the hungry he leaves empty and from the thirsty he withholds water.” (Isa 32:6)</p>
<p>
We also see that fools are quick to start a quarrel (Prov 20:3);<br> it is a sport for them to do mischief (Prov 10:23)<br> and abominable iniquity (Psa 53:1). <br>They reproach others (Psa 39:8);<br> and are adulterous (Prov 6:32). <br> They despise instruction and have no heart for wisdom (Prov 17:16).<br>  They say in their heart or by their lifestyle that there is no God (Psa 14:1).<br> They are not prepared (Matt 25:2),<br> and they will not stand (Psa 5:5). <br> The fool’s house will come tumbling down.</p>
<p>
What will bring the fool’s house down?  Quite frankly, it would probably fall in by itself if given time because it was built by a fool.  Still, the Bible tells us that there is something coming that will destroy the fool’s house.  The Bible speaks of an evil time that will come upon the earth in the end days.  In that time there will be winds, rains, and floods that will test the lives of people.  John speaks of it as “the hour of trial that is going to come upon the whole world to test those who live on the earth” (Rev 3:10).  Jesus no doubt refers to this when  he  says: “Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold, but he who stands firm to the end will be saved” (Matt 24:12).  Finally, Paul exhorts us to “put on the full armour of God, so that when The Evil Day comes, you may be able to stand your ground” (Eph 6:13).</p>
<p>
Paul gives us some colourful details of what the last days will be like.  
<font color= "blue">“For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, 3 unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good, 4 traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, 5 having a form of godliness but denying its power. And from such people turn away!.” (2 Tim 3:2-5)</font></p>
<p>
It should not surprise us that virtually all of these qualities are hallmarks of the biblical fool.  What is surprising is that these fools have a form of godliness.  We didn’t know this about the fool who built his house on the sand.  In Matt 7:22, we learn something else about these end-day fools. They will call Jesus “Lord.” We know by this that they are really Christian fools.  They have, no doubt, gone to many Bible conferences and seminars.  Perhaps they have even taught some of them. They sing all the choruses and shout “hallelujah!” They make a profession of faith, but they are not obedient to the Lord’s commands.  Because of this they are sent away to their destruction.</p>
<p>
These end-day fools could have easily cured their folly by giving heed to the simple commands of the Bible.  To the lovers of money it is commanded, <font color= "blue">“Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, ...”  (Matt 6:19);</font> to the boastful it is commanded, <font color= "blue">“let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath;” (James 1:19);</font> to the proud it is said, <font color= "blue">“Therefore humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God,” (1 Peter 5:6);</font> to the abusive the Bible commands, “And be kind to one another, tender hearted, ...” (Eph 4:32).  The Bible commands go on and on.  If the end-day fools had only taken the time to put them into practice they could have been saved from their folly.</p>
<p>
While we know from the scriptures that fools will abound in the last days, we also know that God will have His wise people.  In Rev 12:17, we see a group of Christians who hold the testimony of Jesus and obey God’s commands. The church has almost felt that these two things, grace and law, were mutually exclusive.  Yet here they are bound together in perfect unity.  It is to such as these the Lord will speak.  He will not say “well said,” or “well thought,” or even “well taught,” but he will say to each one, “Well done, good and faithful servant!” (Matt 25:21).</p>
