Full Assurance

"let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water". (Heb 10:22)</font></p>
<p>
According to the preceding verse, one must fulfil four requirements in order to approach the mercy seat and the throne in the Most Holy Place.<br> 
First, one must have a “true heart”; <br>
Second, one must have a “full assurance of faith”; <br>
Third, "our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience”; and,<br> 
Fourth, "our bodies washed with pure water".<br> 
Let’s look very briefly at each of these.</p>

A True Heart</font></p>
<p> 
We approach God with our hearts, not with our heads. God is not the answer to an intellectual riddle, but He will meet a sincere, longing heart. We must come without pretence, exposing ourselves to God just as we are without hiding anything.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Full Assurance of Faith</font></p>
<p>  
<font color= "blue">“But without faith it is impossible to please Him [God], for he who comes to God must believe.” (Heb 11:6)</font> We must come with absolute faith in God’s faithfulness—not faith in our own abilities or righteousness.</p>

Our Hearts Sprinkled from a Guilty Conscience</font></p>
<p> 
A guilty conscience results from committing wrong, sinful deeds. But through the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus, we have assurance that our evil deeds have been forgiven and that our hearts are pure from sin.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Our Bodies Washed with Pure Water </font></p>
<p> 
1 John 5:6 says that Jesus came by water and by blood. In Heb 10:22, we see both these elements: the blood that sprinkles from an evil conscience and the water that washes our bodies. </p>
<p>
I believe that the water represents Christian baptism. In the New Testament, Christian baptism means sharing in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. So, the “new and living way” mentioned in Heb 10:20 is Jesus. We are to identify with all that He endured when He died for our sins and rose again.</p>
