   <h1>
Acting on the Word
</h1>
<h3>
Practice What You Preach 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"But why do you call Me "Lord, Lord," and not do the things which I say? <br>(Luke 6:46)</font></p>
<p>
You see, here the persons have the right words, but their actions don't match the words. They have committed themselves to being a disciple of Jesus Christ by submitting to His Lordship. At least, this is the public declaration they have made. They call Him Lord. But their actions and behaviour do not match their words.  Many Christians are committed to becoming disciples of Jesus Christ. They call Jesus Lord. They publicly confess His name and submit their lives to Him. But their actions don't match their words.  This doesn't mean that they are unsaved. We are saved by grace through faith apart from works. <br>Just as works do not save us or keep us saved, nor do they reveal who is saved and who is not.</p>
<p>
When someone says they are a Christian, but do not act like it, the most we can say about them is that they are not acting like a Christian. Whenever you or I sin, we are not acting like Christians. And since we all sin every day, we are all guilty of Luke 6:46 every single day.  We attend church on Sunday, and sing, "He is Lord, He is Lord," and then follow that with, "I have decided to follow Jesus, no turning back, no turning back." But then on Monday, we yell at our spouse, we cut corners at work, we mutter that whispered curse, and then close out the day by watching impure images on television. So whatever we said on Sunday is certainly not being acted out in our lives.<br> We talk like Christians, but we certainly don't act like Christians.</p>
<p>
In this final section of Christ's discipleship manual, He tells us that true disciples obey His Words. Are you His disciple? Do you obey what He says? <br> Sometimes we are tempted to think that obedience doesn't matter. <br>If, after all, we are saved by grace through faith apart from works, then why should we obey God? If we get to heaven simply by believing in Jesus Christ for eternal life, then of what benefit are works?  The benefits are numerous.<br> There is the benefit of eternal reward. There's the benefit of loving and glorifying God because of His great love for us. There's the benefit of answered prayer and experiencing God at work in your life. There's the benefit of living the abundant life that God has for you.  Christ gives us another benefit in Luke 6:47-49. Obeying God provides protection from life's storms.</p>
<h3>
Obedience Provides Protection 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue"> 
Whoever comes to Me, and hears My sayings and does them, I will show you whom he is like: He is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently against that house, and could not shake it, for it was founded on the rock. <br>But he who heard and did nothing is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, against which the stream beat vehemently; and immediately it fell. And the ruin of that house was great.” (Luke 6:47-49)</font></p>
<p>
In these three verses, Christ presents a picture of two men who build homes. When a storm comes, one home collapses, while the other stands firm. <br>Most Christians have heard this story before.</p>
<p>
The wise man built his house upon the rock, and the rains came down and the floods rose up, and the house on the rock stood firm. The foolish man built his house upon the sand, and when the rains came down and the floods rose up, the house on the sand was washed away.</p>
<p>
Although most Christians are aware of the story, most Christians do not really know what separates the wise man from the foolish man. It seems to indicate that one man  was wise because he was a Christian, whereas the foolish man represents all non-Christians. There is truth to that. <br>It is the foolish man who says in his heart, "There is no God." <br> And it is amazingly foolish for a person to trust their eternal destiny in some theory of good works. Most people do less research on how to get to heaven than they do on a diet plan. That is foolish.  But that is not the difference between the wise and foolish man in this passage.</p>
<p>
What is the difference between the two men? It is found in Luke 6:47.<br>
"Whoever comes to Me, and hears My sayings and does them, I will show you whom he is like":<br>
Jesus provides three descriptive actions. This man comes to Jesus, hears His sayings, and does what Jesus says.
<p><font size="+1">
Coming</font></p>
<p>
The first action, coming to Jesus, probably refers to coming after Jesus daily as one of His disciples. Jesus says later in Luke 9:23 that if anyone would come after Him, that person must take up his cross daily and follow Him. <br> Are you coming after Jesus every single day? Are you coming before Jesus praying, asking, seeking to learn from Him that day? If you want to weather life's storms, but you are not coming to Jesus for instruction and training in righteousness every day, it's not going to be very long before your house falls. Your house will come crashing down faster than a house of cards in a hurricane.</p>
<p>
It amazes me how many Christians think they can live the Christian life without ever coming to Jesus for their daily bread, without ever performing a spiritual work out, without ever building the Word of God into their lives.<br> It cannot be done. The storms of life are too strong.  Do you want to know why so many Christians turn away from God, and reject Christ, and fall so easily to temptation and sin? For most, it is because they have not been coming to Jesus daily to hear from Him. It's so simple. It's so important. And it's so neglected.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Hearing</font></p>
<p>
But Jesus goes on to say that this first man does more than just come to him; he also hears Christ's sayings. The Greek word for sayings is <i>logos</i>, so this man hears Christ's word. The word for hearing is more than just having the sound waves resonate off our eardrums. It implies hearing with understanding. <br>Hearing with comprehension.</p>
<p>
Approach the Word of God seeking to hear it with understanding as this wise man does. If you don't, you are abandoning the very thing God has provided to help you weather the storms of life. If you refuse to hear and understand God's instructions, there is nothing that can help you. You're already sunk, and you haven't even put your boat in the water yet. Don't think you find your way through life unless you hear and understand God's instructions in His Word.</p>
<p>
The first descriptive term in Luke 6:47 was coming to Jesus. <br>The second is hearing what He says. What is most amazing about this second descriptive term is that it is also true of the foolish man. <br>In Luke 6:49 we read that he also heard.  
So what is it that separates the two builders if even the foolish builder hears and understands?
The descriptive term that separates the two builders is the third item in Luke 6:47. <br>The wise builder comes to Jesus, hears His words, and does what Jesus says.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Doing</font></p>
<p>
As important as the coming and hearing is, Christ's emphasis is on the doing. Here is the key to weathering life's storms. You come to Jesus for instruction. Hear what He says. Then, go out and do it. It is obedience to the Word that keeps your life safe and well protected in the storm.</p>
<p>
Obedience is the key that keeps you strong in life's storms. It is this obedience to God's Word that Jesus illustrates in Luke 6:48. The one who does God's Word is the one who builds his house on the rock.<br>
<font color= "blue">
He is like a man building a house, who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. (Luke 6:48)</font></p>
<p>
Just as there were three descriptive terms for the man, there are three descriptive terms for his construction. Before he constructs his house, he digs deep, then lays a foundation. The progression is to dig deep, lay a foundation, then build the house upon the foundation.
The wise builder does what Jesus Christ says. And a storm does come at the end of Luke 6:48.<br>
<font color= "blue">
And when the flood arose, the stream beat vehemently against that house, and could not shake it, for it was founded on the rock. (Luke 6:48)</font></p>
<p>
Once the house was built by obeying Jesus Christ, it was able to weather the storms of life, not because it was a strong house, but because it had a strong foundation. I don't know what storm is in your life right now. I don't know what storm you will have to face in your future.  But a storm will come. <br>Jesus said that in this world, you will have trouble. Don't think, "Oh, that would never happen to me." It will happen. And if you are not prepared, your life will crumble around you.</p>
<p>
But if you have built you life on Jesus Christ, and obedience to His Word, when the storm comes, no matter how severe it is, no matter how the winds rage, no matter how the torrents of rain fall, no matter how high and violent the river gets, you will stand strong. You will stand firm. Why? Not because you are so strong, but because Jesus Christ is. <br> The end of Luke 6:48 says that the reason the house stood firm was because it was founded on the rock. The person who is obedient to Jesus Christ weathers the storms of life. The opposite is true of the person who is disobedient.<br> Luke 6:49 reveals that those who are disobedient invite destruction upon themselves.</p>
<h3>
Disobedience Invites Destruction 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
But he who heard and did nothing is like a man who built a house on the earth without a foundation, against which the stream beat vehemently; and immediately it fell. And the ruin of that house was great." (Luke 6:49)</font></p>
<p>
Remember, there are many similarities between this builder and the first builder. Both were students of the Word. Luke 6:49 says this builder also heard. He too memorised Scripture, and took sermon notes and engaged in Bible Study. So once again, if you are not doing even those things, you are more foolish than this builder.  He did not fail to study and hear God's Word.<br> His failure was obedience. The text says he heard, but did nothing.<br> He is like the man in James 1:23-24 who looks at his face in a mirror, but once he has looked, goes away and immediately forgets everything he saw. <br>The one who benefits most from the Word is the one who hears it and does what it says.</p>
<p>
What about your life? Are you preparing for the disaster? Preparing for the storm? Dig your foundation deep. Get rid of that sin and that bad habit.<br> Repent of your sin. Dig a hole in your life. Pull out some gnarled stumps of sin, roots and all, then lay the foundation. Out with the old, in with the new.<br> Put Jesus into your life where the sin and bad habits used to be.<br> Obey Him. Love Him. Serve Him. Honour Him. Do what He says.<br> In this way, you will build a house able to weather any storm.</p>
