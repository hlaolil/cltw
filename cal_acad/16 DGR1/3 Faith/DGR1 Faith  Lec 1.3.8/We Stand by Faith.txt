<h1>
We Stand by Faith
</h1>
<p>
Because of unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by faith. Do not be haughty, but fear. (Rom 11:20)</p>
<p>
The olive tree is the place of privilege that was first occupied by the natural branches (the Jews). These branches were broken off because of unbelief but can be grafted on again by faith in Jesus.</p>
<p>
The wild branches are Gentiles who, because of the unbelief of Israel, now occupy the place of privilege. The root of the tree is the Abrahamic covenant that promised blessing to both Jew and Gentile through Christ. </p>
<p>
If we stand at all, it is by faith; we are guilty and helpless in ourselves, and are to be humble, watchful, afraid of self-deception, or of being overcome by temptation. Not only are we at first justified by faith, but kept to the end in that justified state by faith only; yet, by a faith which is not alone, but which works through love to
God and man.</p>
