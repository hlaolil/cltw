   <h1>
Believe that you Receive 
</h1>
<p>
Let's first look at this scripture and break it down for a clear understanding
of how it works:<br>
<font color= "blue">"Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them." (Mark 11:24)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">
Whatever Things You Ask ...</font></p>
<p>
First, make sure what you ask for is in line with God's will. His Word, the Bible, is His will for your life. If you are asking for something out of God's will, then don't expect to have that prayer answered.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures." (James 4:3)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">
When You Pray ...</font></p>
<p>
Next, who do you pray to? You direct your prayer to God the Father.<br> You ask Him for what you want, always using the name of Jesus.<br> 
Example:<br>
"Heavenly Father, I ask you in Jesus' name to give me favour on this job interview."</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Believe That You Receive Them ...</font></p>
<p>
This portion of the scripture has been the stumbling block to so many Christians. Why? They have failed to believe they have received their prayer answered the moment they prayed. You must believe you've got it the instant you pray, even before you can see it with your physical eyes. That's called faith. <br>
Faith is now, not sometime in the distant future. No! You must believe when you prayed in faith, God heard and answered your prayer. 
It's a done deal. <br>It belongs to you now. He has given it to you. You've got the title deed for it. </p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him." (Heb 11:6)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">
And You Will Have Them.</font></p>
<p>
You prayed in faith, asking God the
Father for what you wanted in Jesus' name. You believe He heard
and answered your prayer the moment you prayed.<br> You have
stayed in faith each day, thanking, praising and worshipping God
because you believe you received the title deed for what you asked 
God to give you. Now, it is manifested. You can see it, touch it, hold it. 
Your waiting in faith has paid off. Now you can testify to others how 
God is so good. <br>He manifested the answer to your prayer.</p>
