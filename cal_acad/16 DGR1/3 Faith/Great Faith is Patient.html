  <h1>
Great Faith is Patient
</h1>
<h3>
Exercising Patience
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“For you have need of endurance (patience), so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise:” (Heb 10:36)</font></p>
<p>
If we do not exercise patience, we can lose out on what God has promised us while it was developing in the unseen. Just as planting a natural seed takes time, planting a spiritual seed based on God’s word and His promises also takes time for it to take root and mature.
After we have done our part to stand in faith and trust God, He will get involved with the process and work with us as we exercise patience.</p>
<p>
Patience is a real force that allows us to be totally unlimited through God. Exercising patience changes the way we think, how we speak and also the way we act.<br>
<font color= "blue">“But those who wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint.” (Isa 40:31)</font><br>
Putting patience to work causes you to gain strength. But hoping to receive something without patience and through instant gratification only will weaken you and leave you in a position to eventually be in want.</p>
<h3>
God's Promises
</h3>
<p>
When we receive God’s promises through faith and patience, we do not have to suffer through the caveats (certain acts) that come through the world’s system. The world attempts to offer us ways to get the things we want quicker and without God, but it only leads to side effects that will affect us in the future.</p>
<p>
So, choose today to place your faith in God and exercise patience while He is working for you. By applying the spiritual force of patience to work in your life, it will only be a matter of time before you see God’s promises come to fruition in your life.</p>
