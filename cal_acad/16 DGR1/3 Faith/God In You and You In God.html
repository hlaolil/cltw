God In You and You In God
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
“for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure.” (Phil 2:13)</font></p>
<h3>
God is With You
</h3>
<p>
No matter what you’re going to face this next week, you’re not going to face it alone. God is with you, He is in you, and He is for you.</p>
<p>
“God is working in you.” The word “working” in Greek is the word <i>energos</i>, from which we get the word “energy.” God is the energy driver in your life. <br>You’re not just going on willpower. You’re not just going on your own power. God says He will give you the power you need, no matter what you’re facing.</p>
<p>
Not only is He in you, He is with you. <br>The Bible says,<font color= "blue"> “I will not leave you orphans; I will come to you. At that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you” (John 14:18,20).</font>  That’s quite a promise! The Bible says Christ is in you; the Bible says you’re hidden with Christ in God; and the Bible says you’re sealed with the Holy Spirit. That means for the devil to get to you, he’s got to get through the Trinity!<br> That’s a pretty good protection. That is a great fear reliever.</p>
<h3>
Trust God
</h3>
<p>
Not only is God with you and in you; God is also for you.<br><font color= "blue"> “If God is for us, who can be against us?” (Rom 8:31).</font></p>
<p>
The Bible says we can trust God to treat us with goodness and mercy.<br> 
Because of His goodness, God gives us things we don't deserve, such as forgiveness and salvation. Because of His mercy, God doesn't give us things we do deserve. For instance, because we've sinned, we deserve to go to hell, but through the blood of Jesus Christ, God doesn't give us what we deserve.</p>
<p>
Do you ever feel the smile of God in your life? If you don’t, you don’t really know God. Some people think God is like the angry parent who’s mad at them all the time. No. God is for you!
If you want to be happy, you need to get up every morning and say, “God, Thank You that You’re going to be with me today, You’re going to be in me today, and You’re going to be for me today.”</p>
<p>
Isn’t that great news? If God is with you, and God is in you, and God is for you, what in the world are you doing being depressed?</p>
<h3>
Talk It Over
</h3>
<p>
How do you think God wants you to access His power that is available to you?
When do you doubt God’s presence the most? Ask God for faith to see Him at work in your life.
How will your perspective on a difficult situation change now that you know God is on your side?</p>
