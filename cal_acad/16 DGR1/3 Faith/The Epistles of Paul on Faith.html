The Epistles of Paul on Faith
</h1>
<h3>
Romans - Faith
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? Of works? No, but by the law of faith." (Rom 3:27).</font> </p>
<p>
When we look at natural or scientific laws, like the law of gravity, or the law of aerodynamics, or Newton's laws of motion, they are laws that work consistently every time without fail (assuming nothing supernatural intervenes).<br> Faith also is a law which when operated properly works every time without fail. By using the law of faith we can obtain any of the promises of God, including healing, deliverance from sin, forgiveness of sins, justification, and salvation.<br> It works on the same basis as natural laws such as the law of gravity work, and that is that God ordains that it works, <font color= "blue">"upholding all things by the word of His power," (Heb 1:3).</font> <br>Faith is the means by which we can obtain any of the promises of God, and there are some basic conditions for faith in God to work. These do not all apply in every case, but most of them will.</p>
<p>
(1) We must base our faith on what God has said, or on what we know he will &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;do.<br>
(2) Sometimes we must ask God for it.<br>
(3) Sometimes we must command it to happen.<br>
(4) We must believe that we receive what we ask for or command to happen.<br>
(5) We must confess what we believe.<br>
(6) We must act upon what we believe and confess, by fulfilling any conditions &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;which apply to the situation concerned.<br>
(7) We must endure through any time period that God ordains before the &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;manifestation of the promise.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us; and if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions we have asked of Him." <br>(1 John 5:14-15)</font></p>
<h3>
Corinthians - Faith
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
For we walk by faith, not by sight (2 Cor 5:7)</font></p>
<p>
Such a short verse, but it sums up the Christian life so powerfully.</p> 
<p>
The way we conduct ourselves is by spiritual sight, seeing things through the Spirit with an eternal perspective. A few verses earlier, Paul had written something quite similar:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal.” (2 Cor 4:18)</font></p>
<p>
A faith perspective marks all mature disciples. </p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” (Heb 11:1)</font></p>
<p>
We live out our lives here on earth tethered to heaven by the umbilical cord of the Holy Spirit, guided by the teachings of Jesus and His apostles, and expectant that God's promises will surely come to pass.</p>
<h3>
Galatians - Faith
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith working through love.” (Gal 5:6)</font></p>
<p>
That is to say, faith which is not pretended nor hypocritical, but true and lively. This is faith which exercises and requires good works through love. <br>Which means, he who wants be a true Christian, or one of Christ’s kingdom, must be a true believer. But he isn't a true believer, if works of charity do not follow his faith. So on both hands, as well on the right hand as on the left, Paul shuts hypocrites out of Christ’s kingdom.</p> 
<p>
On the left hand, he shuts out the Jews, and all who want to work out their own salvation, saying, “In Christ neither circumcision,” that is to say, no works, no service, no worshipping, no kind of life in the world, but faith, without any trust in works or merits, avails nothing before God.<br> 
On the right hand he shuts out all slothful and idle persons, who say, if faith justifies without works, then let us not work, but let us only believe and do what we wish.</p> 
<p>
Not so, you enemies of grace; Paul says otherwise. And although it is true, that faith alone justifies, yet he speaks here of faith in another respect; that is to say, that, after it has justified, it is not idle, but occupied and exercised in working through love. Paul, hereby, sets forth the whole life of a Christian man, namely, that inwardly it consists in faith towards God, and outwardly in charity and good works toward our neighbour.</p>
<h3> 
Ephesians - Faith
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; <br>it is the gift of God," (Eph 2:8)</font></p>
<p>
Without faith there is no salvation. We cannot think that those without faith will somehow come to be saved. This is folly. We dare not depend on God’s general goodness by thinking that Christ has died so that it will end up being fine for all. Clearly not. Without faith, there is no salvation. Having said this, there is also a dangerous distortion of this teaching in Christian circles.</p>
<p>
I have been horrified by what I have heard evangelicals say about this verse. <br>It is common to say that faith is our contribution to our salvation.<br> Many Christians have made faith their deserving mark to gain salvation.<br> Because I believe, therefore I am saved. This is opposite of what this passage says.
Although faith is necessary for salvation, it is not our spiritually-inclined nature to respond in faith that saves us. It is not as if we have been awarded salvation due to our faith. Man is so corrupt that he looks anywhere to pride himself in his higher and good status. </p>
<p>
It is quite clear from our general and immediate context that we cannot in any way save ourselves nor make ourselves worthy of salvation. Man, even a good man or religious man, cannot muster enough faith to save himself. I fear for those who think that that they have been awarded salvation due to their faith, as if their confidence is in their faith rather than in Christ.</p>
<p>
Faith should not be understood as our qualifications for being chosen but as a gift from God which brought about new life. In other words, God saw that we were spiritually dead. We could not in any way contribute anything to our salvation or even a more sensitive spiritual heart. We were spiritually dead. <br>God then gives us grace through faith. </p>
<p>
This is what this passage clearly teaches us.<br>
He awakens us with His Spirit and enables us to see what we never saw before. Repentance is the first sign of this newly given faith. We have nothing to give Him. Faith is the next. Faith is something God gives us due to the new life that He makes us alive with. Without His work in us, we have not way to respond just as a dead person cannot respond to light or sound. With Him, we start to see and respond to Him and others.</p>
<h3>
Philippians - Faith
</h3>
<p>
Paul understood that salvation is based upon "the righteousness that comes from God," which is given to those united with Christ (see below), not upon human attainments of obedience to the law (Rom 1:16-17; 3:21-26).<br> Christ alone is the object of the Christian's faith - <font color= "blue">"by faith in Jesus Christ," <br>(Gal 2:16).</font> <br>Paul trusted Christ alone and abandoned all reliance on his own credentials <br>(Phil 3:7-8).</p>
<p>
Faith is the "means," not the "ground," of salvation. Paul declared that we are saved "through" faith, never that we are saved "on account of" faith. The merit of Christ is the ground of salvation. Faith is the instrument that links believers to Christ and His merit. </p>
<p>
We say that we are "saved by faith" or "justified by faith." <br>
What does that mean? Faith, after all, is something we do. We are the ones who believe, not God. But isn't salvation entirely of God? Isn't it entirely by God's grace? Or is faith the one thing we do in order to merit God's forgiveness? Certainly not. It's important to be precise about this, to see what faith does and what it doesn't do for us.</p>
<p>
First, faith is not the ground of our salvation. The ground is what entitles us to eternal life. The sacrifice of Christ is the only ground of our salvation.<br> His righteousness, not ours, entitles us to fellowship with God. Nothing we do is good enough to gain God's forgiveness and fellowship. <br>Not even our faith is worthy of Him.</p>
<p>
For the same reason, our faith is never the cause of our salvation.<br> The cause is the power that brings us into relation with Christ. <br>As we've seen, this power does not come from ourselves; it comes from the power of the Spirit, making us believe the Word and trust in Christ. <br>We cannot do anything to save ourselves, to bring about our own salvation.</p>
<p>
So, what is the role of faith? Theologians struggle for words here, but the word that Reformed theology has settled on is instrument. By this we mean to say that faith, even though imperfect and unworthy, is the means ("instrument" = "means") by which we reach out and receive God's grace. Some have compared it to an empty hand reaching out to be filled. As the hymn "Rock of Ages" puts it, "Nothing in my hand I bring, simply to the cross I cling."</p>
<p>
Rather than tying yourself in knots trying to understand these technical expressions, it is better just to remember that faith is trust. Jesus has died for you; that is your only hope, the only means by which you can be saved. Your faith is simply trust in him. Your trust is not going to earn you anything, but it connects you with Christ, who has earned everything for you.</p>
<p>
Last, Paul uses the phrase, "and is by faith." This phrase might be translated, "given by God in response to faith." Faith receives God's gift of righteousness (Rom 3:22; 5:17), and the exercise of faith precedes God's verdict of justification (Rom 4:3; 5:1; Gal. 3:6). In Reformed theology it has traditionally been said that "faith precedes justification," not in terms of time, but in terms of logical priority. One's justification is dependent upon faith, not one's faith upon justification, although the two occur simultaneously.</p>
<h3>
Colossians - Faith
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"rooted and built up in Him and established in the faith," (Col 2:7)</font></p>
<p>
When you hear the word “rooted” you usually think of a tree. When you plant a tree, it is easy to pull it out of the ground after the first few days. But it will be nearly impossible to pull the tree out once it is properly rooted.</p>
<p>
In his letter to the Colossians, Apostle Paul advises being firmly rooted in the Lord: “[Be] rooted and built up in Him and established in the faith” (Col 2:7). <br>If this can be said of us, then nothing can cause us to be uprooted.<br> It is therefore important that we are firmly rooted in our faith. Anyone who tries to pull us out then will be unsuccessful. Then no spirit can stand a chance against us because we are firmly rooted in the doctrine of Jesus Christ.<br> But this is not always easy because Satan is constantly at work, and he seeks to pull us out of this firm grounding.</p>
<p>
I am reminded of John the Baptist. He was a great man, and had been selected by God for a specific purpose. But he was not properly rooted in the Lord.<br> When he found himself in prison he began to doubt, and sent messengers to ask the Lord if He was truly the one for whom he and his followers had been waiting, or whether they should wait for another. He was not firmly rooted.<br> His faith was not strong enough. He gave room to doubt. Let us not do this.</p>
<p>
When doubts arise, let us reject them and pray to our heavenly Father for the necessary strength.</p>
<p>
Many of the disciples who had heard Jesus say:<br><font color= "blue"> “He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him.” <br>(John 6:56)</font> did not understand these words. And indeed, these words were difficult to understand. Today we have a clear understanding of what these words mean, but for the disciples of that time they were incomprehensible.<br> For this reason, many of them became annoyed and said: “This is a hard saying; who can understand it?” And so they left the Lord Jesus. They were not firmly rooted. They were torn out of the ground because they did not understand properly. <br><font color= "blue">"Jesus said to the twelve, “Do you also want to go away?” "But Simon Peter answered Him, “Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.” (John 6: 67-68).</font> He was firmly rooted in the doctrine of Jesus.</p>
<p>
The disciples on the road to Emmaus had left Jerusalem because they were disappointed. Holy Scripture relates that the Risen One joined them on their way. They did not recognise Him, however. He asked them what they were talking about and why they were so sad. They told Him that the Lord Jesus, who they had believed would redeem Israel, had died. Then the Lord Jesus gently opened their eyes. In the end they recognised Him, but at first they had been uprooted, as it were. After the Lord had spoken to them however, they came to the right understanding and stopped running away (cf. Luke 24: 13-33).</p>
<p>
If we are disappointed, persist in our own opinions, or no longer heed the word of the Lord, we run the risk of being uprooted, or “pulled out of the ground”.<br> Let us be aware of this danger, because the Devil never sleeps. He seeks to uproot us. Let us be firmly rooted in the ground of Jesus Christ and in the teaching of the Apostles. Then we will remain firm and sure in our faith.</p>
