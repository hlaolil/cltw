   <h1>
The Biblical Definition Of Faith 
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen (Heb 11:1).</font></p>
<p> 
This is probably the most concise definition of faith found in the Bible. <br>It is considered the classical definition of faith.</p> 
 <h3>
Faith Is Substance 
</h3>
<p>
The New Testament was written in <i>Koine</i> [common] Greek. The Greek word translated "substance in Heb 11:1 is <i>hupostasis</i>, literally, "that which stands under." The derived meaning is "that which has real existence, the basic essence, the actual reality, the substance of something" </p>
<p>
It is a condition of the human heart that is as real to God as the thing we asked for will be to us when we receive it. It is the exact image of the thing for which we ask (<i>hupostasis</i> is translated "image" in Heb 1:3).<br> When we receive what we have prayed for the image is replaced by the actuality.
 <h3>
Faith Is Evidence 
</h3>
<p>
The Greek word translated "evidence" is <i>elegchos</i>, which basically means "conviction."<br> John writes,<font color= "blue"> "Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him". (1 John 5:14-15)</font>. </p>
<p>
The existence of the God-kind of faith in the human heart is the evidence that what we have prayed for exists. Faith, based on the Word of God, is the evidence—not what we see or don't see—not good or bad circumstances.<br> Faith is not based on human feeling but rather it is based squarely on the fact of what God says. <br>
The evidence is not found in the feeling, rational, visible or sense realm. </p>
<h3>
What Faith Is Not ... 
</h3>
<p><font size="+1">
Faith is not mere Human Hope</font></p>
<p> 
Faith is based on the Word of God alone. Human hope may be based on the sands of wishful thinking or human desire, rather than on the rock of the Word of God. Doubt and hope raise the question, "What shall I do?" Faith says, "I have done!" The common phrase, "I am hoping and praying" is incorrect. <br>"I have prayed and am believing" is more scriptural. <br>Faith is not natural human faith. In order to function in life, we must exercise a natural faith. We have faith in natural laws such as gravity and inertia and assume that they will work the same every day. If the universe were unpredictable and untrustworthy, chaos would reign and life as we know it would be impossible. We trust inanimate machines. By turning an ignition key, flipping on a light switch, boarding an aircraft, we exercise faith in machines. </p>
<p>
We trust vegetables and animals—we assume they will perform according to our past experience. We trust other human beings. We trust our surgeon, our spouse, our pilot, etc. However, faith in God is supernatural—a gift from God. We will examine the nature of faith in God in the next chapter.<br> Faith is not mental assent. John Wesley warned in his time that there was a dangerous substitute for faith that he called "mental assent." He was caught in this dangerous trap and only escaped after failing as a missionary in America. </p>
<p><font size="+1">
Faith is of the Heart</font></p>
<p> 
Our human spirit and not merely our head (human reason). Simply agreeing that God exists and that His Word (the Bible) is true is not Biblical faith.<br> James states that demons believe in this manner and tremble in fear of judgement: <font color= "blue"> You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe—and tremble! (James 2:19).</font><br> Faith is not a psychological attitude. Mere positive thinking may have some good results, but it is not Biblical faith. </p>
<p><font size="+1">
Faith is not sight</font></p>
<p>  
Faith is not based on mere sensory perception or human reasoning. <br>Paul says, We live by faith, not by sight (2 Cor 5:7).</p> 
<h3>
Attributes of Faith 
</h3>
<p><font size="+1">
 Faith Thanks God Beforehand</font></p>
<p> 
If a husband tells his wife that he has placed a hundred Rand note in her purse for her birthday, she thanks him immediately. Why? Because she trusts him. She knows it is hers before she sees it. <br>
Jesus says, <font color= "blue">Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them. (Mark 11:24).</font> <br>God does not answer biblical prayer with "No" or with substitutes.<br> Paul says, <font color= "blue">For all the promises of God in Him are Yes, and in Him Amen, to the glory of God through us. (2 Cor 1:20).</font></p> 
<p><font size="+1">
Faith will Endure to the End</font></p>
<p> 
Abraham waited 25 years for Isaac to be born.<br> Caleb waited 40 years for his land.<br> Noah waited 120 years for his physical salvation.<br> Faith does not look at the calendar, but to Christ. Hope may last a few minutes or a few months. Faith will endure until it is replaced by the thing for which we are believing.<br> D. L. Moody said, Faith that fizzles out at the finish, had a flaw in it from the first.</p> 
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p><font size="+1"> 
Faith is not Hope</font></p>
<p>  
Faith is the means by which we receive those things we pray for. <br>Neither is faith sight. Faith is the evidence of things not seen. Faith can only operate in the realm of the invisible concerning those things we believe in and do not yet see. Faith cannot exist in the visible realm. When the things we pray for are manifested to our sight, then faith, the invisible "substance," having done its work, is supplanted by the visible substance, that is, the things we believe for. When the actuality comes into view, then the image (faith) vanishes. Biblical faith is an absolute requirement for answered prayer. </p>
<p>
The writer of Hebrews states, <font color= "blue"> But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him. (Heb 11:6).</font></p>
