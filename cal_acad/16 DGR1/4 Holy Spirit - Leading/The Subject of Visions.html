The Subject of Visions
</h1>
<h3>
Visions Old Testament
</h3>
<p>
Visions occur frequently in the Bible as instruments of supernatural revelation. They are audiovisual means of communication between a heavenly being and an earthly recipient.</p>
<p>
The terms used to designate visions in both Testaments have to do with seeing or perceiving. The Old Testament terms for vision (the Hebrew verbs <i>raa</i> and <i>haza</i> and their several noun derivatives) mean simply to look at or to see.<br> In the New Testament, <i>horao</i> is one of the Greek verbs for see, observe, or perceive, but its related noun <i>(horama</i> is the common term for "vision."</p>
<p>
Revelatory visions portray scenery or dramatic circumstances to the human recipient while the human is awake. The distinction between a vision and a dream has to do with whether the human is awake or asleep; the result is the same. The prophetic use of dreams and visions is summarised in the Lord's dramatic defence of Moses in the face of Aaron and Miriam's revolt: <br><font color= "blue">"If there is a prophet among you, I, the Lord, make Myself known to him in a vision; I speak to him in a dream." (Num 12:6).</font></p>
<p>
Visions are most frequently found in the prophetic portions of the Old Testament. A prophetic work could be titled as a vision (Isa 1:1; Nahum 1:1), and certain prophecies Ezekiel, Daniel, Zechariah developed a greater capacity for visionary revelation.<br> The extensive use of the term in nearly all the Old Testament prophets implies that visions were a normal medium for receiving the divine word.<br> As such, the "vision" of the Old Testament prophets represents not just a visionary drama perceived by the eyes (as in Isa 6, for example), but also a distinctive world view or perception of reality that was proclaimed through the prophets. So the prophetic vision may be both a scenic, visual communication and a more general prophetic world view. Sometimes a prophetic sermon is introduced as a burden (or "oracle, "massa,). But even this is something that the prophet "sees, " usually using the term <i>haza</i>: <br><font color= "blue">"The burden which the prophet Habakkuk saw". (Hab 1:1).</font></p>
<p>
Visions are also central to the biblical literature known as apocalyptic.<br> There are many definitions of apocalyptic and exactly what we mean by the term can only be explained in sweeping generalities. Ezekiel, Daniel, Zechariah, and Revelation are the biblical books that exhibit the traits of apocalyptic material most clearly, though there are other passages in the Bible and other books from the ancient world that have similar features. In these books, God has revealed details of future events to a seer (human recipient), making heavy use of dreams and visions. The seer is permitted to peer into the heavens to witness scenes that determine future events, and the vision is usually explained by an angelic interpreter.</p>
<h3>
Visions New Testament
</h3>
<p>
Besides the Book of Revelation, visions in the New Testament are concentrated in the writings of Luke.<br> Gabriel appeared to announce the births of John (Luke 1:8-20) and Jesus <br>(Luke 1:26-37).<br> Ananias and Paul received visions to prepare Paul for baptism (Acts 9:10-19). Likewise, Peter and Cornelius received visions to prepare them for Peter's ministry among Gentiles (Acts 10:3-35).<br> Angelic visions freed Peter from prison (Acts 12:9) <br> Paul was called to a European ministry (Acts 16:9), and encouraged Paul in his ministry at Corinth (Acts 18:9). So the visions of Luke-Acts announce God's plans for the immediate future or empower the church for the present.</p>
<p>
The Book of Revelation is a record of prophetic visions given to John, who was exiled on the island of Patmos. <br>The book is in the form of a letter (received address, Rev 1:4-7, and concluding blessing, Rev 22:21), the main body of which consists of a single, yet highly sectioned, visionary experience (Rev 1:9-22:5). The vision was revealed by a heavenly messenger, whose purpose was to point out:<br> <font color= "blue">"the things that must soon take place" (Rev 1:1;22:6).</font><br> The visions of the book reveal the struggle between God and Satan and their servants in heaven and on earth, in addition to visions of God's care for His people.<br> John as the human recipient, <font color= "blue">"saw and heard these things." (Rev 22:8).</font> and responded with appropriate reverence </p>
<p>
Throughout the Bible, visions of God and His sovereign Lordship are needed in order to propagate His truth among humankind.<br> <font color= "blue">"Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint;" (Prov 29:18).</font> Proclamation of God's will among His people ceases, and civilisation itself is jeopardised</p>
