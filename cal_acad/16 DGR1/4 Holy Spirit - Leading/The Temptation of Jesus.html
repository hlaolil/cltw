 <h1>
The Temptation of Jesus
</h1>
<h3>
The Spirit Leads Jesus into the Desert
</h3>
<p>
Luke begins by noting that the Spirit who descended upon Jesus at His baptism (Luke 3:22) leads Him into the desert (Luke 4:1). Empowered by the Spirit Jesus faces the diabolic forces from which the temptations arise.<br> Jesus will also vanquish the devil by the power of the Spirit.<br> The desert is the place where Israel of old had to prove her faithfulness to the God of the covenant. Therefore, it is God Himself who had led Israel into the desert (Deut 8:2) where she was tempted.<br> The duration of time indicated here as forty days is probably symbolic of the forty years of Israel’s wanderings in the desert (Deut 8:2). <br>It is to be understood, in any case, as a symbolic round number meant to convey the idea of a prolonged period of time.</p>
<h3>
The First Temptation
</h3>
<p>
The first temptation consists of a challenge thrown at Jesus by His opponent, the devil, to prove His divine power as God’s Son.<br><font color= "blue"> “If you are the Son of God” (Luke 4:3)</font> has reference to the heavenly declaration, <font color= "blue">“You are My beloved Son;” (Luke 3:22)</font> at the baptism. <br>The devil, therefore, questions or challenges Jesus' divine son ship and, thereby the messianic mission given by His Father. In Luke 23:35-39 we find a similar challenge in the form of a taunt. The nuance of the challenge in this first temptation scene is that Jesus should use His divine power to change a stone into bread in order to satisfy His hunger (cf. Luke 4:2), namely, for His own personal need. The devil thus tempts Jesus to depart from God’s plan whenever His personal needs conflict with God’s will. Jesus refuses to succumb to the temptation. His short answer, <font color= "blue">“man shall not live by bread alone;” (Deut 8:3).</font> Deut 8:1-16 recalls the desert journey of Israel and their temptations<br> (cf. Ex 16; Num 11), how they were humbled and disciplined, and why, therefore, they should trust in God’s provident care.<br> Unlike Israel, Jesus trusts in God with a detachment from His self and His personal needs and with an attachment to God’s will.</p>
<h3>
The Second Temptation
</h3>
<p>
In the second temptation gospel Luke does not specify the place of the temptation as does gospel of Matthew. Nor is there a transfer of Jesus from one place to another as suggested in gospel of Matthew. Besides, by the phrase <br><font color= "blue">“in a moment of time” (Luke 4:5)</font> Luke suggests that it was a matter of a vision. The devil attributed to himself mastery and lordship over the whole world, falsely claims for himself what is exclusively God’s own universal dominion<br> (cf. John 12:31;14:30;16:11; Rev 13:2). <br>Jesus is tempted to receive universal power, dominion and glory from the devil by worshipping him. This implies that Jesus should renounce the Father’s dominion and Lordship. In terms of real life, it means that Jesus should seek power and glory as the Messiah from the devil, that is, by yielding to the popular expectations of a worldly and political Messiah.</p>
<p>
Jesus comes out victorious. He replies again with a answer from Deuteronomy <font color= "blue">“You shall fear the Lord your God and serve Him,.” (Deut 6:13)</font> <br>The context of this text in Deuteronomy recalls the temptation of Israel in the desert to follow after other gods (Ex 23:23-33). But unlike Israel, Jesus rejects the false promises of the devil. He affirms the sovereignty of God, His Father, and chooses to serve Him (Luke 4:8). Jesus' mission itself consists in bringing about the universal reign or the kingdom of His Father over all people.<br> He will be faithful to His identity as the Son and Servant of God as proclaimed at the baptism.</p>
<h3>
The Third Temptation
</h3>
<p>
Here again the temptation is in the form of a challenge to prove Jesus' divine Son ship by feats of superhuman power and unreasonable and presumptuous trust in God. Note that the words “If you are the Son of God” of the first temptation are repeated here. The devil tries to ensnare Jesus by quoting the Scripture, namely, Psa 91:11-12. <br>The background of this challenge, probably, was the current practice of some of the false prophets who claimed superhuman and miraculous powers <br>(cf. Acts 5: 35-37). Jesus' response to this challenge is expressed in the words of Deut 6:16, the context of which was Israel putting God to the test<br> (Ex 17:1-7). Moses exhorted the Israelites not to put God to the test; he warned them saying, <font color= "blue">“You shall not tempt the Lord your God as you tempted Him in Massah” (Deut 6:16).</font> <br>The meaning of this saying on the lips of Jesus is that Jesus does not want to protect His life by using miraculous powers or by testing God. <br>Consequently, He does not succumb to the temptation to use divine power to escape from the consequences of His God-given mission, namely, His suffering and death. He knows that the Messiah must suffer and He is ready <br>(Luke 24:26). Later Jesus will refuse to save Himself from the Cross by any miraculous act and give a crushing defeat to the devil.</p>
<p>
The concluding verse looks forward to the ministry of Jesus; it tells the reader that the devil departs from Jesus only for a while, <font color= "blue">“until an opportune time.” (Luke 4:13)</font> <br> This phrase refers to the passion of Jesus. Luke thus alerts the reader to what is going to happen again, especially at the time of Jesus' passion, when the diabolic forces will do everything possible to thwart God’s plan of salvation in Jesus (cf. Luke 19:47;23:3,53).</p>
<p>
Scholars point out the messianic significance of this narrative, even though the title ‘Messiah’ does not appear here. This narrative is not told primarily to exhort Christians how to act in time of temptations. But its purpose rather is to reveal what Jesus as the Messiah and the Son of God is up to in undertaking to obey God’s plan.</p>
