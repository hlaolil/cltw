 <h1>
The Heart of Flesh
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will keep My judgements and do them. (Ezek 36:26-27)</font></p>
<h3>
The New Covenant and The Holy Spirit
</h3>
<p>
It is only through participation in the new covenant and reception of the promised Holy Spirit that the believer is enabled and empowered to please God, fulfil His law of love, and put to death the deeds of the flesh <br>(Heb 8:7-12; 10:10-18).<br>  Paul powerfully describes this aspect of the new covenant promise in Rom 8.  Through the power of the indwelling Spirit (received by faith) the believer can now put to death the misdeeds of the flesh and live according to the Spirit.</p>
<h3>
Set Free From the Law of Death
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death.  For what the law could not do, weak as it was through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and as an offering for sin, He condemned sin in the flesh, in order that the requirement of the Law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.  For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. Because the  carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be. So then, those who are in the flesh cannot please God. But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His. <br>And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you. Therefore, brethren, we are debtors—not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh. For if you live according to the flesh you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. <br>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. <br>(Rom 8:2-14)</font></p>
<p>
Through the working of the Spirit within us, our desires are turned away from the flesh to the ways of God.  The Spirit regenerates and re-orientates our being so that we are now devoted to pleasing God rather than our fleshly passions.  The Spirit of God gives us the desire and power we need to overcome the flesh and live for God (Gal 5:17-26; 6:7-9).  This is the fulfilment of the promise given in Ezek 36:26-27, and the fulfilment of that promise is dependent on the power of the indwelling Holy Spirit who is received by faith (Gal 3:14).</p>
<h3>
Conclusion  
</h3>
<p>
We can therefore conclude that Ezek 36:26-27 fails as a proof text for the doctrine of regeneration preceding faith.  Ezekiel 36 looks forward to the time of a new covenant effected by Christ’s blood through which believers are cleansed of sin and made new in Christ (2 Cor 5:17; cf., Eph 2:8-10).  <br>It tells us that those who will participate in the new covenant (through faith in Christ) will receive the promised Holy Spirit, through whom the new covenant believer will be empowered to live for and please God by overcoming the passions and desires of the flesh.<br>
When we compare the promise of Ezek 36:26-27 to the fulfilment of that promise in the New Testament, we find that all of the promises and benefits described in Ezek 36 are conditioned on faith.  Therefore, it is impossible to construe this passage in such a way as to teach that one receives a new heart empowered by the indwelling Holy Spirit prior to putting faith in Christ. <br>Rather, the passage is in perfect harmony with the New Testament teaching that the promises and benefits of the new covenant (which includes a new heart and the reception of God’s Spirit) are received by faith.</p>
