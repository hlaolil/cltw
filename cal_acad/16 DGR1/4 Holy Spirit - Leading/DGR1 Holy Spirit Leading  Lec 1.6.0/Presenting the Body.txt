<h3>
Exhortation to the Renewal of the Mind
</h3>
<p>
Paul tells us that God's will is us being willing and able to please Him and serve Him. This is accomplished when we are on guard, that the distractions of the sinful life to not entice, motivate or divert us from Him and His plan for us! The call is simple, be willing to allow God to transform you and not the world, simple yes, but it takes diligence of our efforts from the trust we have in Christ to succeed! When we do this our thinking, attitude, mindset, all the we are in thought, will change and then impact all that we do in life.</p>

"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service." (Rom 12:1)</font></p>

1. I Beseech You/ I Urge You</font></p>
<p> 
Paul's main concern was whether his teaching would be applied, or just studied, or ignored. The apprehension was that Christians would turn out like Pharisees, having the knowledge, but ignoring the application. The irony as that many of us are! Being a living sacrifice is a key aspect into maturity, and growth in the faith. The purpose of doctrine and study of His Word is not just the knowledge, (which is very important), but it is what we do with that knowledge that is our supreme goal.</p>
<p>
a. Brethren/ brothers, meaning in Christ, we as Christians are to be deep friends that are bonded as family.</p>
<p>
b. Present /offer, our relationship with the Lord must be transparent and not secretive (unless you live in a closed Muslim country)!</p>
<p>
c. Mercies of God, flows from our obedience and trust and gratitude for what our Lord has done and for who He is (Luke 10:36-37; Eph. 4:23); they are the compassion for the needy, and the lost. Our lives must be motivated by who we are in Christ and nothing else!</p>
<p>
d. Living Sacrifice, for the ancient Jews, this meant to praise God as a continual lifestyle of worship. This motive continues and refers to the fact that we belong solely to God, not to ourselves or anything else (Rom. 3:25; 6:12-17; 8:13; John 15:13-15; 37-38; 1 John 3:16), His shed blood paid for us! That you are truly have dedicated your right to yourself to Christ! That we give Him are all. It is easy to die for a cause, but are you willing to live for Him? In perfect obedience, so your life is poured out, that your strength is gone and you rely on His?</p>
<p><font size="+1">
2. Reasonable Service</font></p>
<p> 
Means a Rational/Spiritual act of worship to think without distractions or personal agendas; this means our judgements must be logical and concise upon God as Lord and Motivator.</p>
<p>
a. Service meant the work of the priests in the Temple, holy before the Lord. In context, this refers to being a sacrifice and extending mercy to others, this is a part of our worship to Christ, part of who we are and must be. As the Jews placed a lamb on the alter, as Christ was our Lamb, we should place ourselves on the alter too. Not because we have too, or to earn something, but because we are dedicated to live for our Lord.</p>
<p>
b. Do not be conformed ... refers to that our mind and thinking must be based on Christ and Scripture, that the Spirit guides us in (2 Cor. 4:18; 1 John 2:17). If not, the culture and pleasures of life will sweep us away from God's best for us. This is our Christian life and purpose!</p>
<p>
c. Age, refers to "evil powers" and "amoral acts" the worldly sinful temptations in our human culture, whether it is tradition, custom, ritual, or rational.</p>
<p>
d. Our standing before our Lord is solely upon His mercy, thus we are to reciprocate it; such as since God forgave us we need to forgive others .... Thus, do not just ask God to use you, but rather give yourself to Him to use!</p>

3. Renewing of Your Mind</font></p>
<p> 
Means changing our pagan or even Christian mindset away from our selfish nature to His character. Until we do, the deeper things of God's will, will not be available to us. Our ideas and attitudes directly shape our values and lifestyle. To get it right, we are to be shaping our mind to God's Word (Rom 8:5-9; 13:11-14; 2 Cor 4:18; 1 John 2:17).</p>
<p>
a. Transformed, the opposite of obedience is not just selfishness or laziness but rather, creating your own opportunities with zeal instead of the Lord's. That is, misplacing your passion on the wrong things (1 Sam. 15:22; John 7:17; 13:17). We are to cling to His highest standard, not compromise to the flow of the group we hang out with (peer pressure). Will you obey?</p>
<p>
b. Prove, when we allow God's standard to be our "carrot on a stick", then our paths will be straight. So that every aspect of our life is governed by our Lord, in perfect harmony.</p>
<p>
c. Acceptable, means God accepting a sacrifice. When we debate with God and refuse His guidance we lose sight of His path, and fall in rocky terrain, stop, drop to your knees, and wake up to Him (Eph. 4:30). The question is well we be dedicated to our Lord or to ourselves (1 Cor. 6:19; 9:27; Gal. 2:21; Phil. 2:12)?</p>
<p>
d. Being freed from sin must show a response and a responsibility, so what is yours?</p>
<p>
e. God's will, see theological note below.</p>
<p>
Theology is our boot camp and the army is our duty in application. Yet, it is the least thing considered by the average Christian's pursuit, especially those who never take ownership of their faith, who grew up in a church and see it as cultural and duty, and not devotion and lifestyle. The danger is for the Christian to sit in a pew, learn all that they can, and take comfort in that knowledge, but never do anything with it. It is the church that refuses to evangelize, the Christian that refuses to share their faith, or model Christ on Mondays, as well as Sundays: Be aware you will be harshly judged, you are no better than that of the Pharisees (Hos.6:6; Mica. 6:6-8; Matt. 12 9-14; James 1:21-27)! The proof test is if you use people, or serve them? Do you just gather information, or do you apply it?</p>
<p>
When we become a Christian either by birth in a Christian family or through evangelism as an adult, a time must come when the reality of who we are in Christ hits home in power and conviction. To completely change the black dirty oil of the mind with the new golden anointing oil of His love and precepts. This will transform into a practical application of our faith just does not happen on it own, something wondrous must take place within us to transform us so we can. In other words, we must become the people of God in order that we are capable and wiling to do the work of God.</p>
