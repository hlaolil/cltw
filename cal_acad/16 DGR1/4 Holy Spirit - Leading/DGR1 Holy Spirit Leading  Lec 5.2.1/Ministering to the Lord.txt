<h3>
New Testament
</h3>
<p>
The passages related to “ministering to the Lord” in the New Testament are limited.</p> 
<p><font color= "blue">
The  passage: As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, “Now separate to Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” (Acts 13:2) </font> might equally be translated “while they were worshipping the Lord”.</p>
<p>
There are few instances where Jesus is “ministered to:” the first is after the temptation account in the wilderness <font color= "blue">"and behold, angels came and ministered to Him." (Matt 4:11).</font>  Another is Jesus being anointed in the house of Simon the leper by the adulterous woman (Matt 26:6-13), and a general reference to the women that offered help to Jesus and the disciples (Matt 27:55-56) and the anointing of the Lord’s body after the crucifixion might be considered in this same light (Mark 16:1). With the possible exception of the adulterous woman, which might be considered worship as well as service, the instances revolve around meeting the physical needs of Christ. The motivation for doing so was no doubt out of love.</p>
<p>
In the Apostle John’s Revelation, the idea of ministering seems to centre around a constant recognition of the character and nature of God, from the angelic beings that proclaim His holiness (Rev 4:8-11), and His work of salvation, who in response bow down before the throne <font color= "blue">saying with a loud voice: “Worthy is the Lamb who was slain ...” (Rev 5:12-14).</font></p>
<h3> 
General Summary and Conclusions
</h3>
<p>
The common thread seems to be an awesome recognition of the greatness and majesty of the character of God and the recognition of His gracious redemption of His people through His great acts. Ministering to God would then involve an obedient response to God’s character and work, or how worship itself may be defined: “The obedience response to the revealed nature, character, and work of God.” As we worship God then, we are ministering to Him. The more that we understand about who God is and what He has done, the more that we can allow Him to renew and remould our minds and our thinking, the more that we will be better able to minister or worship Him.</p>
<p>
God needs nothing, so there is no need in Him that we might possible meet, however God does have desires: He desires to have a relationship with us. He knows that the most satisfying relationship that meets our inmost needs is found in our recognition of who He is and our submission to the plan that He has for us. We can only come to that relationship through the confession of our sins and recognition of God’s saving act of redemption through His Son, Jesus. We must come to realisation of the absolute power and authority of God over everything, and begin the process of grasping the depth of His love for us in what He did through Christ in redemption.</p> 
<p>
Our submission and obedience are tied to our understanding of who God is and what He has done. As we live our lives allowing His love and work as our point of reference, we joyfully submit our wills and lives to the One who loved us enough to give His own life to reclaim us, rising from the dead, showing His power and authority over even death itself. We respond in obedience to His nature and work. We can do nothing less than worship Him.</p>
