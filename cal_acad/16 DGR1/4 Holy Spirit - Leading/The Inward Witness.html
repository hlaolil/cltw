 <h1>
The Inward Witness
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, (Rom 8:16)</font></p>
<h3>
To Whom Does He Bear Witness?
</h3>
<p>
The Holy Spirit bears witness along with our human spirit that we are children of God. But to whom does He bear witness? The answer is clear in the context that we (i.e., our human spirits) cry out, <font color= "blue">"Abba, Father." (Rom 8:15) </font> In other words, our witness is to God the Father. If the Spirit is bearing witness with our human spirits, then He, too, must bear witness to God the Father. This conclusion is confirmed by Rom 8:26 which asserts that whenever we pray the Holy Spirit intercedes for us. Clearly the Person to whom He is interceding for us is God the Father.
God the Father is the One to whom our human spirits, and the Holy Spirit, bear witness.</p>
<h3>
It Happens As We Pray
</h3>
<p>
The Holy Spirit's witness does not occur constantly. Rather, it happens as we pray. Whenever our human spirits cry out to God saying:<br> <font color= "blue">"Abba, Father" (Rom 8:15; Gal 4:6)</font> see also the Lord's Prayer, <font color= "blue">"Our Father ...")(Luke 11:2),</font> the Holy Spirit witnesses to God the Father that we are indeed His children.
To call God our Father is a way of reminding Him that we are His children. Whenever that greeting is true-that is, whenever a genuine child of God is praying, the Holy Spirit confirms its validity.</p>
<h3>
The Spirit's Witness Is Undetectable
</h3>
<p>
While we are aware when our human spirits cry out to God in prayer, calling Him our Father, we are unable to monitor the Holy Spirit's confirming witness. <br>We cannot infallibly feel, see, hear, or in any way tune in to the witness of the Holy Spirit to God the Father that we are His children-even though in our experience of prayer we might have a general sense that the Holy Spirit is at work. The only sure way we know that He does this is because the Bible tells us that He does.
God Delights in These Reminders.</p>
<p>
God takes pleasure in this twofold testimony of our status as His children. This should motivate us to do our part.
And what is our part? Our part is to pray.<br> As we say, "Our Father," the Holy Spirit says, "Yes, this is a child of God."</p>
<p>
What a joy it is to realise that God delights in being reminded by us, and by the Holy Spirit, that we are His children.</p>
<h3>
God's Promises Are All We Need
</h3>
<p>
According to the Apostle John, if we accept the testimony of God concerning His Son, then we know that we have eternal life (1 John 5:913).<br> Assurance is objective. It is sourced in the Gospel. If we accept Jesus' claim that <font color= "blue">"He who believes in Me has everlasting life" (John 6:47),</font> then we know that we have everlasting life!
It goes without saying that if we can know we have eternal life simply by accepting the testimony of God, then nothing else is needed.</p>
<h3>
Assurance Is the Backbone of Confident Prayer
</h3>
<p>
Those who search for the so called inner witness of the Spirit do so in vain since that is His witness to God the Father, not to us.
Feelings can be deceptive. Liver quivers are unreliable.</p>
<p>
Look to the biblical promise that he who accepts the testimony of God concerning His Son has ever lasting life. That and that alone is the only way to know for sure that you are a child of God. The Scriptures are the real witness of the Holy Spirit to us. The Spirit's work in assurance is through the Word, not through feelings.</p>
<p>
Only on the basis of the promises of God as found in His infallible and inerrant Word can we know for sure that we are His children. And only with such assurance can we confidently call God our Father.</p>
