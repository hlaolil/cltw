"For assuredly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, "Be removed and be cast into the sea," and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that those things he says will be done, he will have whatever he says. Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them." (Mark 11:23-24)</font></p>
<p>
The things you speak consistently are what will come to pass in your life. What you continually say with your mouth is what you believe in your heart. Your words are your faith speaking. If there is a mountain in your way, don't ask God to do something about it. You speak to it. You speak to the sickness or disease. You speak to the symptom coming at your body: "Pain, I speak to you in the Name of Jesus and I command you to leave my body. </p>
<p>
When you pray is when you believe you receive. Believe you receive your healing when you pray, not when you feel better. This is how faith works. You receive, not according to how much better or worse you feel, but according to what the Word says. Accept the Word and don't go back on it. Give your attention to God's Word, not the symptoms of sickness or disease. Make up your mind to stand, no matter how long it takes. Determine to be steadfast in the faith.</p>
<p>
If the symptoms of sickness or disease continue to linger, this is the time that you must hold fast to a fearless confession of the Word of God. <font color= "blue"> "Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has great reward. For you have need of endurance, so that after you have done the will of God, you may receive the promise: (Heb 10:35-36)</font></p>
<p>
For you have need of steadfast patience and endurance, so that you may perform and fully accomplish the will of God, and thus receive and carry away [and enjoy to the full] what is promised."
It is so important that you learn to be steadfast. Once you learn to be steadfast in your faith concerning healing, you will know how to be steadfast in other areas. When you learn to be moved by God's Word— not by circumstances, not by how you feel or what you see—you can receive anything that God's Word offers. Healing is a good place for you to learn steadfastness. When you can be steadfast on the Word of God with pain in your body, then you can certainly be steadfast on the Word of God with your bank account or anything else. When you stand steadfast until you receive the answer, you will always get results.</p>

Do not waver. Abraham did not waver. No unbelief or distrust made him waver. Doubt will keep you out of the blessings of God. Wavering is doubt. Train yourself to rely only on what God's Word says. Train your eyes and your ears to be obedient to the Word.
What your eye sees does not discount the Word of God. What your ear hears does not discount the Word of God. Bad news does not discount the Word of God. Your heart is established, trusting in the Lord. The thing that should be in authority in you is the Word of God. Go by what God's Word says. It is the key to victory in any situation. Learn to rely on God's Word.</p>
