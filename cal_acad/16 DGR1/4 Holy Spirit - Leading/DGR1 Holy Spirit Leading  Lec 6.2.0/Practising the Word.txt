Practising the Word

<h3>
Understand and Apply Scripture
</h3>
<p>
Live according to the Word of God.<br>
All Scripture must be diligently studied and accurately applied. The Bible says:<br> <font color= "blue">“Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth” (2 Tim 2:15).</font><br> 
<font color= "blue">“But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves” (James 1:22).</font></p>
<h3>
Consider the Context
</h3>
<p>
As part of a thorough, accurate application of Scripture, it is wise to ask questions such as these:<br>

To whom was it written? By whom?<br>
What were the circumstances?<br>
What are the precise meanings of the words in the original language?<br>
What related Scriptures might provide additional insights?<br>
<h3>
Meditate on the Passage
</h3>
<p>
Studying to show ourselves “approved unto God” involves more than simply learning the facts. Meditation on the text is the next step. Only as you meditate on Scripture—a verse, several verses, or a passage—will you begin to see underlying principles that can be applied in your life. <br>
The psalmist testified, “I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy testimonies are my meditation.” (Psa 119:99)</p>
<h3>
One Interpretation and Many Applications
</h3>
<p>
There is only one interpretation of Scripture, but there are unlimited applications of Scripture. The Holy Spirit will guide you into all truth and show you how to apply God’s Word in your life. (See John 16:13–15)</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul presented an application of a teaching in the Old Testament. He emphasised the right of ministers of the Gospel to receive a living wage. To support his instruction, he cited Deut 25:4 <font color= "blue">“You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain.” (1 Cor 9:9)</font> At first glance, it may appear that this verse had nothing to do with the subject at hand. However, upon closer examination, it is clear that Deut 25:4 offers an excellent illustration of the principle Paul was teaching.</p>
<h3>
Understand Christ’s Commands
</h3>
<p>
Paul told Timothy that he based sound doctrine on two things: Christ’s own words and that which leads to Christlike living. (See 1 Tim 6:3) A powerful way to apply Scripture is by first studying Christ’s words, including the commands He gave to us, and then finding their foundation in the Old Testament and application in the New Testament Epistles. Discovering this threefold witness will increase your understanding of the Bible. (See 2 Cor 13:1)

For example, Jesus spoke of honouring parents:<font color= "blue"> “For God commanded, saying, "Honour your father and your mother";  and, "He who curses father or mother, let him be put to death.” (Matt 15:4)</font><br> 
His statement echoes: <font color= "blue">“Honour your father and your mother, that your days may be long upon the land which the Lord your God is giving you.” (Ex 20:12)</font> <br>
The Apostle Paul reinforced these concepts: <font color= "blue">“Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. “Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. “Honour your father and mother,” which is the first commandment with promise: “that it may be well with you and you may live long on the earth.” (Eph 6:1–3)</font></p>
