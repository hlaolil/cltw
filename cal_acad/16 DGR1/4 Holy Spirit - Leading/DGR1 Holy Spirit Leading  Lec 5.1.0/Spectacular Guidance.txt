Struck by Lightning
<h3>
<p>
As Saul <font color= "blue">"journeyed he came near Damascus, and suddenly a light shone around him from heaven. Then he fell to the ground, ...” (Acts 9:3-4).</font> While it is not certain what struck Saul, in our experience lightning is as close as we can get. In that circumstance, one would surely end up on the ground. In any event, if you or I were struck by lightning, it would get our attention. We would seriously re-examine whatever we were doing at the time. And that is just what God did with Saul. He got his attention!</p>
<p>
Moments after being struck to the ground, Saul got up only to discover that the intense light had left him blind. We read that “Then Saul arose from the ground, and when his eyes were opened he saw no one.” (Acts 9:8). This was but a metaphor of Saul’s spiritual state. He thought he knew what he was about. However, his physical condition revealed the truth about his soul. God wanted to show him how truly blind he was. He wanted him to think about what he was doing. And He arranged for him to have some time to think over his intentions.</p>
<h3>
Saul, Saul, Why do you Persecute Me?
</h3>
<p>
Through the spectacular event on the road to Damascus, we discover what Jesus wanted to teach Saul. He had gotten his attention by the flash of incandescent light which dazed Saul and left him temporarily blind. While on the ground, he was astounded further by a voice with a question: “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?” (Acts 9:4) Although blinded and disoriented, there was no doubt this was no human voice. Saul responded, “Who are You, Lord?” (Acts 9:5)</p>
<p>
We now come to the incredible statement from Jesus which was to transform Saul’s life and would give direction to the church for the rest of its existence. To the blinded man laying on the ground came the answer, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.” (Acts 9:5) Like the blazing light that stunned and blinded him, this one statement uprooted Saul’s entire religious education and experience.</p>
<p>
Yet, think for a moment. The light Saul saw was “from heaven.” Even the men who were accompanying Saul couldn’t figure it out. We read they remember <font color= "blue">“hearing a voice but seeing no one” (Acts 9:7).</font> The last time Jesus was visible on earth was shortly after His resurrection. Luke recorded that after His final charge to His disciples, <font color= "blue">“He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight” (Acts 1:9).</font> Obviously, Jesus was not on earth. Stephen, in the last moments of his life, also had a vision of the risen Christ. Where was Jesus? He said, ““Look! I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!” (Acts 7:56).</p>
<p>
In that instant on the Damascus road, Saul realised that Jesus was indeed risen. The resurrection story was not a myth. Yet God had even more to reveal to him through this encounter with His Son. So He gave Saul more time to think. (See the rest of Acts 9)</p>
