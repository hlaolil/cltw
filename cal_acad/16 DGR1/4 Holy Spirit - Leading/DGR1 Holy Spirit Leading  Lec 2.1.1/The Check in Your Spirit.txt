The Check in Your Spirit

Now when they had gone through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia. After they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit did not permit them. (Acts 16:6-7)</p>

Did you ever wonder how Paul and Timothy knew it was the Spirit talking to them? Maybe they acted on a subtle but definite inner prompting and only in retrospect did they realise it was the Holy Spirit. Alternatively, as my Quaker friends would say, the "way would open." Or not. And that's often how the Spirit guides us still.
I love that the Spirit seems so very practical and yet so powerful.</p>

How about this passage preceding Peter's church-changing encounter with Cornelius: <font color= "blue">"While Peter thought about the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Behold, three men are seeking you. Arise therefore, go down and go with them, doubting nothing; for I have sent them" (Acts 10:19-20).</font> After that, we read of Peter, welcoming Gentiles without first requiring circumcision: <font color= "blue">"Then Peter opened his mouth and said: “In truth I perceive that God shows no partiality. But in every nation whoever fears Him and works righteousness is accepted by Him. ... Can anyone forbid water, that these should not be baptised who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?" (Acts 10: 34-35;47).</font></p>

This same practical and powerful Spirit is active everywhere in our world today. But we seldom notice. This column is dedicated to noticing. I want to notice places and people rich in Spirit and places and people in need of Spirit.
There is a simplicity about God-in-the-person-of-the-Spirit that is both disarming and attractive.</p>
<p>
This is how the Spirit does things. In whatever situation we find ourselves, the Spirit is as committed to our own growth into the God-Mystery as to the success of the mission we have been given. In fact, as nearly as I can tell, they are two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>
Thank You, Holy Spirit, for just this incomprehensible work that You’ve done, not just in creation but in regeneration. You gave us life. You gave us salvation, forgiveness, You empower us, and You guide us, now please sanctify us and You’ll bring us to glory.  We’ll be glorified by Your power.  We’ll be changed by Your power.  We’ll be fit for heaven by Your power. In the meantime, You’re there producing fruit and energising our gifts and empowering our witness and fighting against our flesh and praying for us and making everything work together for good, securing us and sealing us to the day of redemption.

How amazing. How loving. How simply Spirit.</p>
