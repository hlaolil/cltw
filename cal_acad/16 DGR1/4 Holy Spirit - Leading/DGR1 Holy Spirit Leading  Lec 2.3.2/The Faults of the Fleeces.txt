The Faults of the Fleeces

<h3>
Putting a Fleece before the Lord?
</h3>
<p>
The idea of putting a fleece before the Lord comes from the story of Gideon in Judges 6. He asked for a sign from God proving that God would do what he had promised. First, he put out a fleece and asked God to make the fleece wet but the surrounding ground dry. When God did this, he asked for a second sign, this time making the fleece dry and the surrounding ground wet.</p>
<p>
Notice a few important details in this story:</p>
<p> 
(1) Gideon wasn’t trying to find God’s will. God had already told Gideon what he wanted Gideon to do. <br>
(2) Gideon knew exactly who was giving him these instructions. There was no uncertainty on his part that God was speaking to him. <br>
(3) God had already given Gideon a sign (at his request). God had caused fire to flame up from a rock and consume the meat, bread and broth Gideon had placed there (Judges 6:21).</p>
<p>
So if Gideon knew this was God, and knew what God’s will was for him, why did he insist on putting out a fleece? Read his own words:<br>

Then Gideon said to God, “If you are truly going to use me to rescue Israel as you promised, prove it to me in this way. . . . then I will know that you are going to help me rescue Israel as you promised.” (Judges 6:36-37) 
This doesn’t demonstrate Gideon's faith in God, but his lack of trust. God had already given His promise to Gideon, and even graciously demonstrated His power. That should have settled the issue; all that was left was for Gideon to trust and obey. His putting out a fleece, demanding proof from God, is certainly not an example we want to follow.</p>
<h3>
But it works!

<p>
Many of us have stories of doing something like I’ve described above, and it seems as if God responded. Maybe you’ve used one of these methods, and everything turned out well. You got the right job, the right spouse, the ministry that was meant for you. But we need to be very careful how we interpret our experiences. Often all a good outcome proves is the mercy and grace of God.</p>
