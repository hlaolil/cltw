The Standard of Testing

<h3>
A Test for Evil Spirits
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed, and no one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit.(1 Cor 12:3)</font></p>
<p>
There is great interest today in the power of spirits. However, many people have not understood that many spirits are evil. The actions of those spirits are completely opposite from the work of God’s Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>
Here, Paul gives a simple test to show whether a person is speaking by the power of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit always gives honour to Jesus.<br> So, whenever a person gives honour to Jesus as their Lord (master and God), the Holy Spirit has helped that person to do that.</p>
<p>
The Holy Spirit never opposes Jesus, because there is only one God, Father, Son and Spirit. So whenever anyone says evil things about Jesus, that person cannot be speaking by the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>
It is the nature of evil spirits to lie. Such spirits often cause people to say things that are not sincere. That explains why people sometimes seem to say good things by the power of evil spirits.<br> For example, <font color= "blue">“Let us alone! What have we to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Did You come to destroy us? I know who You are—the Holy One of God!”<br> (Luke 4:34)</font> and,<br> <font color= "blue">
This girl followed Paul and us, and cried out, saying, “These men are the servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation.” <br>(Acts 16:17).</font></p>  
<p>This shows Jesus' reaction to this behaviour:  <br><font color= "blue">And demons also came out of many, crying out and saying, “You are the Christ, the Son of God!” And He, rebuking them, did not allow them to speak, for they knew that He was the Christ. (Luke 4:41) </font></p>
<p>
Those evil spirits were not trying to give honour to Jesus. Instead, they were trying to attract attention for themselves. We see that also in the loud shouts and wild behaviour of people whom evil spirits controlled.<br> When spirits attract attention to themselves, they take attention away from Jesus.</p>
<p>
So, although evil spirits may seem to give honour to Jesus, that is never the reality.<br> When someone insults Jesus, those evil words never come from the Holy Spirit. And a person can only give honour to Jesus with the help of the Holy Spirit.</p>
