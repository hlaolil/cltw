Ignorance
</h3>

“Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent,” (Acts 17:30). </p>

Peter applied this same theme of excused ignorance to the Jews who rejected Jesus (Acts 3:17).</font>  Johnson writes, “It is of fundamental significance that they [the Gentiles] are called from where they began, just as were the Jews. Their times of ignorance are not treated any differently than the ignorance that excused the first rejection of Jesus the Prophet by the Jewish people”.</p>

Paul notes that God patiently tolerated human ignorance in ages past (Rom 3:25). In Lystra, Paul says that God <font color= "blue">“let all nations go their own way” (14:16).</font> While God “overlooks” sin, there is also retribution for people who suppress the truth about his eternal power and divine nature — he lets sin have its natural results (Rom 1:18-32).</p>
<p>
But times have changed; a new beginning in God’s dealing with the human race has begun. Forgiveness for sin and intimate contact with God through the Holy Spirit is possible. Repentance and acceptance of Jesus as Saviour is commanded. The days of groping in the dark and spiritual ignorance are over. The day of repentance is here and the time of judgement is coming.</p>

Paul now warns the Areopagus that his speech is not idle philosophical speculation. His call to repentance is serious because God <font color= "blue">“has set a day when he will judge the world with justice” (17:31).</font> (The quote is from Psa 96:13.) The New Testament makes clear in many places that a “day of judgement” is coming. The offer of salvation in Christ is counterpoised with the warning of judgement for those who reject him. </p>
