The Carnal Man

And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual people but as to carnal, as to babes in Christ. I fed you with milk and not with solid food; for until now you were not able to receive it, and even now you are still not able; for you are still carnal. For where there are envy, strife, and divisions among you, are you not carnal and behaving like mere men? (1 Cor 3:1-3)</font></p>

We need to begin this study by answering the question – ‘What is a carnal Christian?” The word carnal means – flesh. Paul often used this word as a reference to our old fleshly nature. When God created man, He gave man certain appetites of the body and soul. Emotions such as love, passion, anger and fear are all a part of our human nature. Before man’s fall into sin, these emotions were good because they were under the control of God’s Spirit. But after man fell, he became spiritually dead and therefore these emotions of the body and soul were left to run wild without any type of godly influence or control. Thus we have what scripture calls the flesh or a carnal nature. <font color= "blue">Because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be. So then those who are in the flesh cannot please God. (Rom 8:7-8)</font>  Spiritual carnality is living in sin.</p>

So what is a carnal Christian? Some believe that there is no such thing. To them, if we are acting carnally – we’re not saved. Yet we know that all Christians sometimes sin. The Apostle John writes –  <font color= "blue">If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. (1 John 1:8-9)</font> Christians sometimes sin and fail the Lord. Yet true Christians do not choose to wallow in sin. True Christians feel a sense of guilt and shame concerning their sin and they seek forgiveness.</p>
<p>
Only God knows for sure whether a carnal man is born-again or not. Rather than judging other men, you and I should be judging ourselves. Though we may not be doing some of the things others might do, are there things in our lives that are displeasing to the Lord? Is there a carnality to our Christianity that needs correcting? It is God’s will that every believer live not as the carnal man but rather as the spiritual man. </p>

Only God knows what is in someone’s heart. Only He knows if someone is saved or not. I pray that if there are any among us who question their salvation, they will seek out spiritual guidance so that they can know for sure. How sad it would be to expect to go to heaven and hear our Lord say – <font color= "blue">“I never knew you; depart from Me,” (Matt 7:21-23)</font><p>
