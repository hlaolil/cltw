“For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.” (Rom 8:14)</font></p>
<p>
Romans 8 offers profound, eternal comfort to Christians. In it Paul assures us that all true Christians shall ultimately be glorified and conformed to the image of Christ (Rom 8:29,30) and that nothing in the entire created universe can separate them from God’s love (Rom 8:31-39). After the lament in Romans 7 that even the redeemed still battle with sin, Romans 8 assures all Christians of ultimate victory. In the midst of this chapter of hope, Paul tells us that “sons of God” are led by the Spirit of God.</p>
<h3>
Who are the Sons of God?
</h3>
<p>
Romans 8 begins with this promise:  <font color= "blue">“There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus/” (Rom 8:1).</font> Condemnation means to be ultimately condemned by God at the last judgement because of one’s sin. Paul assures us that if we are “in Christ,” we are free from ultimate, eternal death. Here is the reason: <font color= "blue"> “For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and of death” (Rom 8:2).</font> In the Greek, the verb “has set” is in the aorist, meaning something that happened at a point in time. That point in time is conversion. All who believe the Gospel, trusting the finished work of Christ who died and was raised bodily from the grave, have been set free! The “me” in “set you free” (Romans 8:2) is all true believers, all who are regenerate. Condemnation, as we will see later, does not mean, “feeling condemned,” but means being condemned however one might feel. Freedom likewise is objective. Having been set free from the penalty of sin, the believer stays in this state of freedom, even when feeling “wretched” (Rom 7:24).</p>
<p>
So far Paul has been talking about all true believers. Let us see if he continues to do so. In Rom 8:5-8, Paul takes up a discussion of the flesh and the Spirit. He speaks of the mind set on the flesh and the mind set on the Spirit. Some have become confused at this point and thought that Paul was speaking of two classes of Christians, the “carnal Christians” and the elite, “spiritual” ones. For example, <font color= "blue">“For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace” (Rom 8:6).</font> They assume that some elite Christians listen to the Holy Spirit’s inner promptings and thus experience more life and peace, and other carnal Christians listen to the flesh and experience “death” -- lack of spiritual vitality. However, the next two verses show that this interpretation is untenable. The mind set on the flesh is not just lacking inner joy, it is hostile to God and unable to submit to His law: <font color= "blue">“Because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be. So then, those who are in the flesh cannot please God” (Rom 8:7,8).</font></p>
<p>
Being hostile toward God and unable to please Him does not sound like a description of born again believers. But it is a perfect description of the unregenerate. Consider what Paul wrote elsewhere: <font color= "blue">“But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.”(1 Cor 2:14).</font></p>
<p>
The context of this passage shows that the “things of the Spirit of God” have to do with the message of salvation through a crucified Messiah which is considered foolishness to the Greek mind. If a person cannot accept that message, he or she is lost. The cross is the only way to salvation. So those in the flesh who cannot please God are the unregenerate. The next verse says so explicitly: <font color= "blue">“But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His.” (Rom 8:9).</font> One either has the Holy Spirit and belongs to Christ, or does not have the Spirit nor belong to Him. All true Christians are born of the Spirit and belong to Christ. He calls us “His own” (John 17:9,10).</p>
<p>
Therefore, in Rom 8:1-9 Paul is clearly talking about all true believers. He is not writing about two classes of Christians -- the carnal ones and the elite, spiritual ones. He is contrasting the redeemed and the condemned, with the former having the Holy Spirit and the latter not. Those who have the Spirit belong to Christ and are truly alive. They all have the same hope, which is the resurrection from the dead and conformity to the image of Christ. Paul continues his thought: <font color= "blue">“And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you.” (Rom 8:10,11).</font> The fact of being indwelt by God’s Spirit assures us that these mortal bodies will be transformed even as Christ’s was, He being the “first fruits” of those to be raised from the dead.  Those without the Spirit mind the things of the flesh and cannot please God. The flesh in this context means “all that one is outside of Christ, in his sinful nature.” It is not an anatomical term, but describes the nature of the entire person.</p>
<p>
The answer to the question, “who are the sons of God?” is “all true believers, all the regenerate.” Nowhere in the context of Rom 8 is Paul making a distinction between elite “spiritual, mature sons” and “carnal, immature” ones. Rom 8:9 specifically says that one either has the Spirit and belongs to Christ or has neither the Spirit nor Christ. There is no two tier version of “have and have not” Christianity taught here or anywhere else in Scripture. This goes for the entirety of Romans 8, all the way through to the glorious “Christian’s Triumph Song”5 of Rom 8:31-39 . No blood bought child of God is excluded. All who are justified shall be glorified (Rom 8:29, 30 ) and constitute the “sons of God.”</p>
