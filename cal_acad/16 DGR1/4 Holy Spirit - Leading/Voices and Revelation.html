 <h1>
Voices and Revelation
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
“For I testify together to everyone who hears the Words of the prophecy of this Book: If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that have been written in this Book, and if anyone takes away from the Words of the Book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the Book of Life, from the holy city, and from the things which have been written in this Book.” <br>(Rev 22:18-19)</font></p>
<h3>
A Warning
</h3>
<p>
These verses contain a warning to anyone who tampers with the biblical text and
the question is whether these verses refer to the whole Bible. </p>
<p>  
This warning is given specifically to those who distort the message of the Book of Revelation.<br> Jesus Himself is the Author of Revelation and the giver of the vision to the apostle John (Rev 1:1). As such, He concludes the book with a confirmation of His testimony to the finality of the prophecies contained in Revelation. <br>These are His words, and He warns against distorting them in any way, whether through additions, subtractions, falsifications, alterations, or intentional misinterpretations. The warning is explicit and dire. The plagues of Revelation will be visited upon anyone guilty of tampering in any way with the revelations in the book, and those who dare to do so will have no part in eternal life in heaven.</p>
<p>
Although the warning in Rev 22:18-19 is specific to the Book of Revelation, the principle applies to anyone who seeks to intentionally distort God's Word.<br> Moses gave a similar warning in Deut 4:1-2, where he cautioned the Israelites that they must listen to and obey the commandments of the Lord, neither adding to nor taking away from His revealed Word.<br> Prov 30:5-6 contains a similar admonition to anyone who would add to God’s words: he will be rebuked and proven to be a liar. <br>Although the warning in Rev 22:18-19 applies specifically to the Book of Revelation, its principle must be applied to the entire revealed Word of God. <br>We must be careful to handle the Bible with care and reverence so as to not distort its message.</p>
<h3>
The Seekers after More Revelation
</h3>
<p>
Yet, there are always those who seek for "more." More spirituality, more emotion, more revelation. There are those contemplatives and those mystics who teach that if one will only sit still long enough and be quiet enough, they may actually hear the voice of God. There are those who maintain that the Lord still sends prophetic dreams and visions. It is as if God still has more to say, that He didn't quite finish His sentence when the Apostle John closed the book on Rev 22:21.</p>
<h3>
The Seekers after Personal Revelation
</h3>
<p>
To these it may be asked, "Do you write down these personal prophecies and revelations given to you by "God" in the back of your Bible? <br>Are you in the midst of composing the Book of Beth or John or Bill?" <br>Such questions usually will be met with scoffing and exasperation, but are they not appropriate? After all, when God speaks, does He not speak authoritatively? Surely it is impossible for the God of the universe to speak with only partial authority!<br> Either God speaks reliably and with supremacy, or He does not speak at all.</p>
<p>
Those who seek after personal revelation, whose ears must be perpetually strained to hear the mumblings and whispers of "God" surely must be forgetting the words of the Apostle Peter. Peter, who himself witnessed the Transfiguration of the Lord Jesus Christ, says this about the importance of God's Word:
<p><font color= "blue">
For He received from God the Father honour and glory when such a voice came to Him from the Excellent Glory: “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” And we heard this voice which came from heaven when we were with Him on the holy mountain.
And so we have the prophetic word confirmed, which you do well to heed as a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts; knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. <br>(2 Peter 1:17–21) </font></p>
<p>
It is truly amazing, is it not, that God would offer to men such a Word as revealed through His Son, Jesus Christ? <br>How dare the creature demand anything more when He has already provided all that is necessary</p>
