Put the Spirit First

<h3>
Spiritually Minded 
</h3>
<p>
People can quickly tell if we are spiritually minded by what we like to talk about ("out of the overflow of your heart the mouth speaks"). We cannot hide it. Being spiritually-minded means thinking and meditating on the word of God very often. If we do that, we will also want to talk about what we are often meditating on. We will love Bible discussions and Bible studies, not avoid them. Also, we should encourage spiritual-mindedness in others by often discussing matters of the spirit with our Brothers and Sisters. Encouraging one another spiritually is a command for all God's people.</p>
 <h3>
Not Being Spiritually Minded	
 </h3>
<p>
Having a spiritual mind is of paramount importance. Why? <br>
Because, according to Rom 8 (discussed below) God does not consider those who are not spiritually minded to be His children.<br> 
Obviously, if we are not His true children, we won't be receiving an eternal inheritance from our Heavenly Father. <br>
That certainly puts a premium on the spiritual mind, doesn't it? </p>
<p>
In other words, we can faithfully attend public assemblies, give lessons at church, conduct Bible studies, be law-abiding citizens, and the like ... But if we fail to have spiritual minds, we are not part of God's true family (more on this later). <br>
Therefore, we should all strive to be spiritually minded—according to God's definition (not our own), because He's the One Who will be providing our inheritance, if we remain faithful until death (Rev 2:10). </p>
<h3>
What Exactly is a Spiritual Mind
</h3>
<p>
The Bible says:
<font color= "blue">"For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace". (Rom 8:5-6)</font></p> 
<p><font color= "blue">
"If then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God. Set your mind on things above, not on things on the earth." (Col 3:1-2)</font></p> 
<p>
Plainly, for you or me to be "spiritually minded," we must have our minds very often on spiritual matters—in contrast to things of this earth.<br> 
Therefore, we must work to keep our minds "camped" on spiritual thoughts throughout the day. In so doing, we will be able to also <font color= "blue">"live according to the Spirit" (Rom 8:5).</font><br> 
In other words, if you get your mind right, your body will follow. </p>
<p>
Or on the other hand, having an "unspiritual" mind means simply not setting (or "camping") your mind often on the things of the Spirit, on the things of God, on the things of the Bible. 
Please note that being "unspiritually minded" doesn't necessarily mean continually dwelling on evil thoughts. That's having an "evil mind." </p>
<p>
Likewise, being "spiritually minded" should not be confused with having your mind continually thinking about administrative matters of the church (advertising meetings, accounting work, organisational work, lawn mowing, secretarial work, kitchen cleaning, etc). 
Although performing administrative activities may indeed be doing part of God's work (though teaching and preaching God's word is of greater value: see Acts 6:3-4, Luke 10:38-42 [Mary & Martha]), thinking about such to the significant exclusion of truly spiritual thoughts is of little value.</p> 
<h3>
Why you Can't be Saved Without a Spiritual Mind
</h3>
<p>
Please consider the following verses:
<p><font color= "blue">
For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. (Rom 8:5)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. (Rom 8:6)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
So then, those who are in the flesh cannot please God. (Rom 8:8)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His. (Rom 8:9)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
For if you live according to the flesh you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live. (Rom 8:13)</font></p>
 <p><font color= "blue">
For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. (Rom 8:14)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father. (Rom 8:15)</font></p>
 <p><font color= "blue">
The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, (Rom 8:16)</font></p>
 <p><font color= "blue">
and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified together. (Rom 8:17)</font></p>
<p>
From these (and other) Biblical verses, we can quickly derive the following conclusions:<br>
Being saved means "inheriting" eternal life (Matt 19:20). <br>

We inherit eternal life by obtaining our Father's (God's) inheritance. <br>

For God to be our Father, He must first "adopt" us into His family. <br>

To be "adopted," we must have spiritual minds. <br>

Having "spiritual minds" means "setting our minds on things of the Spirit."<br> 

Having "spiritual minds" also means "living in such a way as it's clear that we are being led by the Spirit"—in other words, "living according to the Spirit." <br>

Therefore, to obtain eternal life, we must "set our minds on things of the Spirit." It's hard to get much plainer, isn't it? <br>

Only those who have spiritually-dwelling minds, and Spirit-led actions, are going to receive God's inheritance of eternal salvation. <br>

Therefore, developing and possessing a spiritual mind is of paramount importance. </p>
<h3>
Examples of what spiritual, and unspiritual minds will dwell on 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
John said that "the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but he who does the will of God abides forever." (1 John 2:17) </font>

Therefore, I hope you would agree that it makes little sense for us to invest large amounts of time and energy to earthly matters. 
Christians who spend a lot of time talking about—and being involved in—church assemblies, Bible studies, Bible discussions, Bible reading, Bible meditation, visiting the sick, encouraging others spiritually, and the like—leave a picture of where their hearts likely reside.</p> 
<p>
On the other hand, people who spend a lot of time involved in—and talking about—sports, shopping, hunting, fishing, hiking, skiing, vacations, and the like—leave a troubling picture of what's going in their minds as well. (There is sometimes value in such activities when in moderation.) </p>
<p>
Spending a lot of time involved in, or thinking about, meaningless entertainment, doesn't really make a lot of logical sense—since, again, "this world and its desires are passing away." 
Furthermore, a person who is developing a spiritual mind takes on an entirely different outlook toward things (and people) they may have considered uninteresting. As they increase their wisdom and understanding, they come to realise that where they really need to be "investing" is in heaven. That's where their treasures need to be securely stored, rather than on this earth.</p> 
<p>
And the spiritual mind also starts valuing those who value these things. Instead of giving precedence in their lives to rich clients or the future of their businesses, they are quick to respond to, communicate with, and encourage their brothers and sisters in Christ. Such valuable people—who are God's adopted children—move to the "front burners" of their lives. 
If your mind isn't set on spiritual things, your decisions and actions will likewise follow. That's why we should be very careful about what we allow to continually access our minds—be it inappropriate content from TV / movies / music / internet / books / novels / magazines—or the like. 
Surely we must understand that all this is of satanic origin. </p>
<h3>
How to Tell if a Congregation is Unspiritual 
</h3>
<p>
Just as individuals cannot hide spiritual (or unspiritual) minds, so is the case with congregations.</p> 
<p>
Some of the signs a congregation that is unspiritual:</p> 
<p>
One example is this: When a congregation is eager to attend non-spiritual events (such as organised church games, church dinners, cookouts, and the like)—but lacks interest in spiritual activities (Bible studies, Bible discussions, praying together, mutual spiritual encouragement, attending all church assemblies, or the like)—that's a troubling sign of a spiritually dead congregation.</p> 
<p>
Churches, and individuals, that fail to support the complete cause of Christ (reminder: Christ died to purchase the church–Acts 20:28), because they don't want to miss a Sunday afternoon NFL game or some other meaningless event or program, will have to answer to the One who died for their sins. </p>
<p>
Here's a troubling reminder to such congregations: In Rev 2 and 3, Jesus addressed entire congregations that needed to repent. 
I truly believe there are many today that need to do the same. </p>
<p>
Sadly, many congregations pattern themselves after those who would call themselves "leaders." If leaders set wrong examples, their congregations are in trouble. Conversely, leaders must not only set proper examples of spiritual-mindedness, but encourage and rebuke those whose commitment level is not where it should be. </p>
<p>
The Holy Spirit warned church leaders as follows:
<font color= "blue">"Obey those who rule over you, and be submissive, for they watch out for your souls, as those who must give account". (Heb 13:17)</font>
Church leaders will one day have to "give an accounting" to God for the direction they took their churches. And considering the spiritual state of many modern churches, that is a chilling thought indeed.</p>
<h3>
Final points to ponder
<h3>
<p>
Physical Israel was commanded to impress God's teachings on their own hearts, and the hearts of their children (Deut 6:6-7). However, they became complacent, which led to a lack of knowledge <font color= "blue">"My people are destroyed due to a lack of knowledgefor lack of knowledge" (Hosea 4:6),</font> which meant they were not dwelling on the commands and teachings of God, which meant they did not have spiritual minds. God therefore destroyed His people, who were religious, but not spiritual—much like their successors, the Pharisees, who were responsible for crucifying their own Messiah.</p> 
<p>
David was described as a "man after God's own heart." He was unsurprisingly the one who wrote: <font color= "blue">"But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in His law he meditates day and night." (Psa 1:2).</font> Is there any question upon reading the Psalms of David that he was indeed spiritually minded? </p>
<p>
The Bible says: <font color= "blue">"Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord" (Col 3:16).</font> If we do this, we will have spiritual minds.</p>
