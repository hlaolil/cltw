Fasting Before The Lord
</h1>
<h3>
Problem Fasting
</h3>
<p>
There was a problem with fasting in Jesus' day. He had to give instructions to correct the abuses and to give His people insight on how to fast when led to do so.</p>
<p>
Fasting is a spiritual self-discipline that focuses on God. Unlike prayer and giving, it is not commanded. The only fast commanded in Scripture is the fast that was part of the Day of Atonement (Lev 16,23).</p>
<h3>
The How and Why of Fasting
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Moreover, when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, with a sad countenance. For they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men to be fasting. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward. But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, so that you do not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. (Matt 6:16-18)</font></p>
<p>
The purpose of fasting is not self-promotion, but humility. However, by the time of Jesus, fasting had become a prideful display of self-righteousness. <br>It was a virtually meaningless ritual, devoid of its original purpose. <br>The Pharisees fasted twice a week (Monday and Thursday). They deliberately changed their appearance when they were fasting by wearing old, torn and soiled clothes. They sprinkled ashes or their head and often rubbed ashes on their face to gain both attention and sympathy from onlookers.<br> They took extraordinary measures to show their peers they were fasting. <br>This is the opposite of what God’s people should do when they fast. <br>Jesus told us not to fast like the Pharisees because they have their reward, and there is nothing of spiritual value in that reward.</p>
<p>
Jesus taught us to avoid drawing any attention to ourselves, to groom and go about our lives in a normal manner. Fasting, according to our Lord, is not about seeking attention for ourselves, but sincerely seeking God.<br> When we need to seek God for some particular direction or blessing, we turn aside from food and other distractions. Fasting is meaningful when we are led to fast — not with public displays, but with private and personal motives. </p>
<p>
Fasting and prayer are often mentioned together in Scripture.<br> Some writers have come to the conclusion that Christians can pray without fasting but we cannot fast without praying.<br><font color= "blue"> “When I heard these words, I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed before the God of heaven.” (Neh 1:4)</font><br>
<font color= "blue">
“When they had appointed elders for them in every church, having prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed.” <br>(Acts 14:23)</font></p>
<p>
A few biblical personalities who fasted include Samson, Samuel, Hannah, David, Elijah, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Daniel, John the Baptist, Jesus and Paul.</p>
<p>
Fasting is certainly appropriate for those occasions in life when we need God’s comfort, direction or grace. When we fast, we are not looking for a reward, but for God. It is not a formula for blessing, but a means of grace that can help us during unique and challenging times.<br> In fasting, we seek God, hear from God and then honour God.</p>
