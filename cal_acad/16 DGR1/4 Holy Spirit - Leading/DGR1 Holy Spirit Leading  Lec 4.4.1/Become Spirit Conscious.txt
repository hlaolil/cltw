Become Spirit Conscious

<p>
Become more Holy Spirit conscious and less self-conscious.<br>
Spiritual maturity progresses as you become more Holy Spirit conscious and less self-conscious. For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. (Rom 8:5-6) You are in a process of dying to yourself that Christ’s life may become manifested in you; the more you die to yourself the more of His life is in you. For you who live are always delivered to death for Jesus' sake, that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in your mortal flesh. (2 Cor 4:11) Jesus says, <font color= "blue">“And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me. He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for My sake will find it.” (Matt 10:38-39)</font></p>
<p>
Fortunately God gives you the power to become spiritually minded through the Holy Spirit so that Christ’s life can be manifested in you and through you. There are seven characteristics that you can count on from the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>
The first thing you can count on from the Holy Spirit is that He will be with you forever.<font color= "blue"> “And I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may abide with you forever; the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He dwells with you and will be in you.” (John 14:16-17)</font> So the Holy Spirit will be with you forever, in this life, through death, and in the next life, He is your unity with God.</p>
<p>
You also receive wisdom, and understanding from the Holy Spirit. You receive counsel, which are words from God, and power, which is faith that comes through hearing God’s words. You also receive the knowledge of God, which causes you to have the fear of God. The more you know God the more that you will stand in awe of Him. Notice that you are to delight in the fear of God, the fear of God is like a fence that keeps you safe and close to God and it helps you to keep your heart clean and holy before God. The fear of God helps you to experience the joy of a clean heart before God.</p>
