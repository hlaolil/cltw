Praying With The Spirit

<h3>
Praying in Tongues
</h3>
<p>
Often people misinterpreting 1 Cor 14:14-16, practice praying in tongues. <br>The verses are actually an admonishment against such a practice. <br>The passage says:<br>
<font color= "blue">
"For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful. What is the conclusion then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the understanding. I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with the understanding. Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how will he who occupies the place of the uninformed say “Amen” at your giving of thanks, since he does not understand what you say?" (1 Cor 14:14-16)</font></p>
<p>
Evidently, in the Corinthian church people were praying in tongues.<br> Paul points out that praying in tongues was fruitless because one did not understand what they were praying. Nowhere in God's word is there an example of one praying and not understanding what they praying. <br> Explaining what biblical prayer is about,<br> <font color= "blue">"Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men," (1 Tim 2:1) </font><br>
Jesus said, <font color= "blue">"And whatever things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive." (Matt 21:22)</font> <br>The question is how can one believe when they do not know what they are praying? Never in the Bible is prayer ever presented as being done without one's understanding. When Paul mentions praying in the "spirit" it is an admonishment against the practice. Note the word "spirit" is not capitalised and refers to praying in our thoughts, not through the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>
Paul uses a double illustration saying if he prays in the spirit he prays with his understanding and that in the same way he sings in the spirit it is with his understanding. Nothing in the verse is saying a person should pray and not understand what they are praying. Therefore the verses are not establishing praying in tongues, but reproving those that were doing it.</p>
<h3>
What are Biblical Tongues?
</h3>
<p>
The word translated "unknown tongues" in the New Testament is the one word "glossa." It means a language. It would clear up a lot of misunderstanding if the Greek word was translated "language." In Elizabethan English the word "tongue" was used for the word language. The italicised word "unknown" is inserted in our English Bibles to clarify that the language was not a learned one. <br>The biblical gift of language was a special gift given to Jews with which Jews spoke the Gospel and declared that Jesus was the Messiah to other Jews. <br>The three legitimate times when the gift of speaking the Gospel in an unlearned language occurred was when Jews received the gift and there were Jews present to hear the message. <br>In the case of the Corinthians we must understand that this was a mixed church of Jews and Gentiles. Further the practice was being misused and Paul's discourse in 1 Cor 12-14 was an admonishment and instruction to correct their error.</p>
<p>
God states <font color= "blue">"But even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them." (2 Cor 4:3-4)</font> <br>The foundational truth in God's word is that nothing is done is secret nor is God's word mystical and in any way hidden. God inspired Peter to write,<font color= "blue"> "knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation," (2 Peter 1:20)</font> <br>God's word is His revelation to men and it is given to edify and build up the believer. Never is it presented as being hidden or given to anyone in an exclusive way. Those who were present on the day of Pentecost and in the two other accounts in the Book of Acts heard plainly God's truth in their own language.</p>
<p>
In 1 Cor 14:22 Paul plainly states what were biblical tongues.<br><font color= "blue"> "Therefore tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe but to unbelievers; but prophesying is not for unbelievers but for those who believe." (1 Cor 14:22)</font> The statement cannot be clearer that the biblical sign gift of tongues was not given as a sign to believers, but to unbelievers. Tongues therefore was a sign gift to the lost Jews. If God intended tongues to be a prayer language as the modern Charismatic movement teaches why did He not inspire Paul to include this in the definition? Let us be very clear about this, God gave the sign gifts, one of which was the ability to speak the Gospel in an unlearned language, not to believers, but to unbelievers. <br>If the modern tongues speaker is going to follow God's word, then he or she must conclude that praying in tongues was not what God intended it to be.<br> Nor should they accept that tongues was a sign gift to believers that they had received the baptism of the Holy Spirit. No gift was to be used for one's personal edification, but to be used to enlighten others.<br> In 1 Cor 12:8 the passages show the spiritual gifts given were to benefit others.</p>
