The Sound of God's Voice
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
“And the Lord called Samuel again the third time. So he arose and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you did call me.” Then Eli perceived that the Lord had called the boy. Therefore Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down; and it shall be, if He calls you, that you must say, "Speak, Lord, for Your servant hears.”<br> So Samuel went and lay down in his place. Now the Lord came and stood and called as at other times, “Samuel! Samuel!” <br>And Samuel answered, “Speak, for Your servant hears.”” (1 Sam 3:8–10)</font></p>
<p>
A few people not having been taught that God does in fact speak through His Word, in our spirits, accompanied by Scripture in dreams and visions etc, are keen to know more. The fact is that, the possibility of hearing God’s voice with any reasonable certainty, troubles many Christians. Some will say that it isn't scriptural, although, from cover to cover of the Bible, there is example after example of people hearing God’s voice. I guess, like anything, it only becomes real when you experience it yourself through your meditating on Scripture, in prayer, in your spirit, and in visions.</p>
<p>
I recall a particular story in Acts 10:19-20 where God spoke to Cornelius through an angel, telling him to send for Simon Peter, whilst Peter thought about a vision from God the Holy Spirit told him to go and receive the men sent from Cornelius and to go with them. Like He has to do with most of us, God had to break through Peter’s unbelief, assumptions, and doubt. <br>Does He need to do that with you? Allow Him to!</p> 
<p>
Scripture describes real-life accounts of God speaking, none differently to young Samuel. What we need to be clear on though is that, as we are all wired differently, how you hear God’s voice may very well differ from how I do.<br> The key is to spend time in the Word and asking God questions of the text (that’s why I have recommended journalling to you) and learning to cultivate a quiet, inward, and intimate space of constant listening within a conversational relationship with him. </p>
<p>
One thing is certain; God is not hesitant or reluctant to speak to us.<br> God said to Jeremiah;<font color= "blue">“Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things, which you do not know.” (Jer 33:3).</font>  <br>The key in all of this in your response to this question; “Are you listening?” <br>You will recall Jesus saying; “Whoever has ears, let them hear!” <br>I will always remember the first time I heard God speak into my heart in my teens; perhaps you too can recall a time like that, since that time it has been an ongoing conversation.</p> 
<p>
Samuel learned to do this too. Following on from the first time he prayed; “Speak, for Your servant hears.” (1 Sam 3:10). As we read on through his life he continued in conversation with the Lord and it is clear that he taught David to do likewise.</p> 
<p>
May you determine to be still and attentive to God in the core of who you are, and know, that the more you take God’s Word into you and saturate yourself in it, the more you will recognise His hand moving in your life and your heart. <br>If you seek God’s voice you will be able to hear it, but don't be reluctant to ask God for more answers to give you an awareness of what He is doing.<br> As you continue to do this you will find that it becomes easier for you to recognise God’s voice with clarity and confidence going forward in your life</p>
