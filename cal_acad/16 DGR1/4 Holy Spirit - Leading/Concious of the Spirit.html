<h3>
The Leading of the Holy Spirit
</h3>
<p>
Christian life can be burdensome and uninteresting when we are not following the leading of the Holy Spirit. Your life will be very pleasant and enjoyable if you chose to always be in tune with the Spirit of God. As believers filled with the Holy Spirit, we need to pay attention to the leading of the Holy Spirit.<br> The plan of God is that we should be led by His Spirit, not by our brains or emotions. You are a spirit being and you are filled with the Spirit of God.<br> The Holy Spirit is constantly communicating with your born again spirit.<br> The problem is that most Christians are not paying attention to the leading of the Holy Spirit. Our brains can’t be smarter than the Holy Spirit, and it is to our benefit if we are careful to follow His leading. The Holy Spirit wants to lead you every step of the way but He can’t drag you along with Him, you have to choose to follow Him willingly and deliberately.</p>
<p>
The Holy Spirit has the blueprint for your life and He can show you what you need to do and how to go about it. It’s useless struggling through life with hard labour and nearly nothing to show for it while the Holy Spirit is always inside you and eager to show you what steps to take, what decisions to make, where to go and what to do at every moment John 16:13. <br>Your life becomes stress free when you consistently follow the leading of the Holy Spirit. The bible tells us that God will lead us beside the still waters <br>Psa 23:2. That is a peaceful place. The Holy Spirit wouldn’t lead you into crisis and problems. He would rather show you how to avoid troubles and problems so that you can enjoy your life to the fullest in God. Christians are not to hop in and out of problems. The Holy Spirit wants to lead us through peaceful paths but He will not force us. We have to follow Him by ourselves. He is a peaceful Spirit and He doesn’t impose His will on anybody. He wants us to submit our will to His leading.</p>
<p>
You need to keep in mind that the Holy Spirit is inside you John 14:17.<br> He is not in heaven waiting for you to call on Him. He is right inside your heart (spirit). He wants to lead you every time and He will do that by communicating with your spirit. You will perceive this communication in your heart.<br> The Holy Spirit doesn’t lead through emotions or feelings. Your emotions and feelings are subject to the manipulations of your flesh. God and His Spirit have nothing to do with the flesh. The flesh is a fall out of the fallen human state.<br> The flesh works to produce sin Rom 7:5.</p>
<h3>
Heeding the Holy Spirit 
</h3>
<p>
Any time the Holy Spirit wants to lead you, He will give you the message in your heart. It may come in the form of a perception or a knowing in your heart.<br> It is usually not a loud or dramatic thing. It is often simple and soft. <br>If you don’t pay attention you may not even know that the Holy Spirit is speaking to you. Some other time, the Holy Spirit might give you some kind of restraints or cautions in your heart. These kinds of restraints happen when you are about to take a step or make a decision that may not be the right or the best one. You will do yourself a great deal of good to exercise caution any time the Holy Spirit flashes you the red signal. <br>
If you are about to do something and you suddenly feel a restraint in your heart about it, don’t hurry into error or mistake. Keep in mind that Holy Spirit has the blueprint for your life and if you are about to make a wrong decision or taking a wrong turn, He knows. The cautions and restraints of the Holy Spirit sometimes may be what will save you from danger. The Holy Spirit won’t just watch you walk into danger or error. He will try to stop you.</p>
<p>
If you are about to finalise a business deal and you suddenly feel a check in your heart, put a hold on the business. Take some time to pray in the Spirit to get better clarity on what the Lord want you to do. If the restraint persists, then forget about the business deal.<br> 
If you are in a relationship and the Holy Spirit is flashing you the red light, you might not want to proceed with marrying that person. The Holy Spirit knows what you don’t know. The Holy Spirit knows if the man/woman will abandon you. Pay attention to the leading and the cautions of the Holy Spirit and you will enjoy a beautiful and pleasant life.</p>
