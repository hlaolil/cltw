 <h1>
Hear The Spirit Speak
</h1>
<h3>
Is it Possible?
</h3>
<p>
Is it possible to hear the voice of the Holy Spirit? Jesus told His disciples, <font color= "blue">“However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come” (John 16:13).</font></p>
<p>
The Holy Spirit is available to those who have put their trust in Jesus Christ.<br> He speaks to our hearts and leads us in the right direction when we learn to listen.<br>The Holy Spirit has been described as wind (John 3:8), a dove (Mark 1:10),<br> and a gift (Acts 2:38).<br> The Spirit of God can be grieved and quenched by disobedient believers. However, it is possible to hear the voice of the Spirit when believers humble themselves to:</p>
<h3>
Be Quiet
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Come aside by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while” (Mark 6:31).</font></p>
<p>
We are sometimes too busy to hear the voice of the Holy Spirit. He is gentle and patiently waits for us to hunger for His presence in our lives. Being quiet before the Lord is more than just not talking. It’s quieting your anxious thoughts and meditating on His word as you wait to hear from the Holy Spirit. We need to find a good place where we can sit before God uninterrupted by other distractions.
The voice of the Holy Spirit is gentle and quiet—very difficult for us to hear when we don’t pay close attention.

<h3>
Be Prepared
</h3>
<p>
<font color= "blue">
“Prepare the way of the Lord; make His paths straight” (Mark 1:3).</font></p>
<p>
We must take the time to reflect on our words, actions, and thoughts if we want to hear from God. Our sins keep us from hearing the quiet voice of the Holy Spirit. By confessing and repenting of our sins—we allow the Spirit of God to come into our hearts that has been cleansed by the Lord. The more we grow in our relationship with God, the more sensitive we become to the presence of sin.</p>
 <h3>
Be Aware
</h3>
<p>
<font color= "blue">
“Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, “If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed. And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” (John 8:31-32).</font></p>
<p>
It’s difficult to hear from the Holy Spirit when we don’t know the Bible. <br>We are most familiar with the word of God through hearing and teaching. <br>Also through personal memorisation, meditation, and personal study can believers know the truths of God’s word. Everything the Holy Spirit speaks to our hearts will line up perfectly with Scripture. Through consistent exposure of the Bible, we will gain greater confidence in hearing the voice of the Spirit.</p>
<h3>
Be Open
</h3>
<p>
<font color= "blue">
“Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen” (Heb 11:1).</font></p>
<p>
Faith is the foundation of our walk with God. We believe in Him even though we can’t see or touch the Holy Spirit. Our faith is demonstrated by our solid trust that God will lead us in the right direction even in times of the unknown.can  There needs to be an openness coupled with courage to stepping out in faith when following the direction of the Holy Spirit. The opportunity of faith emboldens us to grow up spiritually and become more acquainted with the voice of the Spirit.</p>
<h3>
Be Ready
</h3>
<p>
<font color= "blue">
“Remind them to be subject to rulers and authorities, to obey, to be ready for every good work, to speak evil of no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing all humility to all men” (Titus 3:1-2).</font></p>
<p>
Our faith in the Holy Spirit is evident when we are ready to obey even when it’s inconvenient. The readiness to follow in obedience gives us the assurance that we are moving in the right direction. The Holy Spirit empowers the obedient with great strength and peace in the midst of difficulty. Believers who hear from God make it a practice of their lives to obey His word.</p>
 <h3>
Be Patient
</h3>
<p>
<font color= "blue">
“Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering;” (Col 3:12).</font></p>
<p>
Hearing from the Holy Spirit requires us to be patient and wait.<br>  The Holy Spirit can’t be rushed into our life situations. He knows the whole story from beginning to end and will move in the appointed time. We need to seek His peace and learn to wait on the Lord with an attitude of expectancy, not complacency.</p>
<h3>
Are you Listening? 
</h3>
<p>
The voice of the Holy Spirit is gentle and quiet—very difficult for us to hear when we don’t pay close attention. We are connected to the Lord through the Holy Spirit allowing the sweetest communion. By choosing to humble ourselves in being quiet, prepared, aware, open, ready, and patient—we will hear His voice more clearly and we will trust Him more freely. The Holy Spirit is a gift of God’s grace to His people—open your gift wisely and be blessed in His presence.</p>
