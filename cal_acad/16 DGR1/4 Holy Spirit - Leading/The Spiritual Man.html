The Spiritual Man
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
"But he who is spiritual judges all things, yet he himself is rightly judged by no one. For “who has known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct Him?” <br>But we have the mind of Christ". (1 Cor 2:15-16)</font></p>
<p>
Perhaps the most important part of Paul’s description of the spiritual man is that he or she has the "mind of Christ". To have the mind of Christ does not mean that we reach a level of perfection or infallibility equal to Jesus.<br> Rather it means that Christ shares with us His spiritual wisdom that enables us to see life from a heavenly perspective and therefore make decisions that are wise for both now and eternity. How does someone become a spiritual man?</p>
<p>
First of all, to become a spiritual man, someone must be born-again by the Holy Spirit. (see John chapter 3) But that is not all. The spiritual man is also someone whose life is under the control of God’s Spirit. Notice what Paul writes:<br>
<font color= "blue">
But as it is written: “Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love Him.” But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God. For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God. Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by God. (1 Cor 2:9-12)</font></p>
<p>This verse is often used as a reference to heaven, but actually it speaks of what is possible for the believer here on earth. The things Paul is referring to are not the walls of crystal and streets of gold, but instead, many wonderful spiritual truths concerning God and His kingdom. To help us know Him better, God has given us His Spirit.</p>
<p>
Through the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit, God reveals to us His deep spiritual truths. Such truths include God’s plan of salvation as well as how to live the Christian life. In brief we may say that the spiritual man is someone who is a Spirit-led man.<br>
Without the Holy Spirit we would not be able to understand the deep things of God. Without His illumination, God wonderful truths would remain to us a mystery. But with the Holy Spirit, we have an intimate guide who not only knows the heart of God, but our heart as well. Through His careful and loving guidance, we are able to receive God’s Word as our bread of life.</p>
