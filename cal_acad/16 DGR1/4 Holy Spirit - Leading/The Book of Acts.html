The Book of Acts
</h1>
<p>
The Apostles Philip, Peter and Paul were all led by the Holy Spirit to preach the Gospel to the Gentiles. Accounts of these events are described in the following Chapters: 
<h2 align="center">
Philip
</h2>
<p>
The account of the Ethiopia eunuch ought to be of interest to all men and women everywhere, for it clarifies how one does, and does not, become a Christian. First, let’s observe some things that are revealed about the man.</p>
<p>
He was a man from Ethiopia with great authority, a treasurer under Queen Candace, and he had charge of all her treasure (Acts 8:27). Surely he was a man of high integrity and honesty. This moral man had been up to Jerusalem to worship. Obviously he was either a Jew or a proselyte under the Jewish dispensation. His commitment to God is evident due to the fact that Ethiopia was a trip of about 1,600 km. Surely his devotion ought to inspire us all and make those of us ashamed who consider a 10km trip too far to attend the worship services of God Almighty.</p>
<p>
Notwithstanding his honesty and sincerity, this man was lost, for he worshipped God under the Mosaic system which had been abolished at the cross of Calvary (Col 2:14; Eph 2:12-16). God, however, was interested in this man’s salvation and steps were taken to bring the eunuch in contact with a preacher of the gospel. Please observe just how the matter was done.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
An angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, (Acts 8:26),</font> not to the man to be converted, but to Philip who was in Samaria preaching the gospel (Acts 8:5-12). May I ask why? Surely the angel could just as easily have gone to the eunuch as he did to Philip 58km away in Samaria. Well, here is the answer.</p>
<p>
From the moment Christ placed the conditions of reconciliation into the hands of faithful men (Matt 28:18-20; Mark 16:15-16; 2 Cor 5:18-20), until this very hour, there has never been one person converted to Christ in the absence of God’s power to save, the gospel of Jesus Christ (Rom 1:16).<br> I know there are people who would deny the truth of that statement based upon some alleged personal experience. Nevertheless, there is not a man alive who can destroy that principle, nor do I fear any contradiction from God’s word, for try as one might, there is not a single case where anyone ever became a Christian without hearing, believing and obeying the gospel of Christ.</p>
<p>
God’s angel instructs Philip to <font color= "blue">“go toward the south along the road which goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza.” (Acts 8:26).</font><br> Just as Philip arrives at his destination there is the chariot before him with the eunuch sitting and reading from the prophet Isaiah. The Holy Spirit, likewise interested in the conversion of this man, does precisely as did the angel and goes to the preacher (not the sinner) and directs him to <font color= "blue">“Go near and overtake this chariot.” (Acts 8:29).</font><br> Philip, as he ran to the chariot, heard the eunuch reading aloud from Isa 53:7-8, </p>
<h2 align="center">
Peter
</h2>
<h3>
Open Door 
</h3>
<p>
Peter opened his sermon to the people in Cornelius’ house by stating a fact that had impressed itself indelibly in Peter's heart:<br> <font color= "blue">“In truth I perceive that God shows no partiality.” (Acts 10:34).</font> <br>This fact had always been true, for from the beginning God had said,<br> <font color= "blue">“If you do well, will you not be accepted?” (Gen 4:7).</font> <br>However, because of Jewish teachings, traditions, and prejudices, Peter had not realised the universal application of this truth before this day.</p>
<p>
In its first appearance, the Church seemed only a Jewish sect; but through the calling of Cornelius and his household, God instituted a great change and showed His will to include the Gentile people into His plan of redemption.<br> The Apostles and disciples had felt that only Israelites, and those Gentiles who came under the influence of the Mosaic Law, were eligible for the worship of God; but now the door of faith was open to everyone who would enter.<br> The restrictions of the Mosaic institution were at an end; and in Christ Jesus there was to be <font color= "blue">“where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcised nor uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave nor free,” (Col 3:11).</font></p>
<p>
Considering the magnitude of the change and the difficulties of long established custom and training that had to be overcome in the Church itself, the reason can be clearly seen why God opened the way with such an abundance of miraculous happenings. The visit of the angel to Cornelius with instructions to send for Peter; and, in addition, God’s vision and counsel to Peter on the housetop which concluded with the words: <font color= "blue">“Go with them, doubting nothing”(Acts 10:19)</font>; together with the descent of the Holy Ghost upon all the people assembled in Cornelius’ house, convinced Peter and the brethren who accompanied him to Caesarea that this was the Lord’s doings. They rejoiced with these people that God had opened the door of the Church to the Gentiles as well as to the Jews.</p>
<h3>
Progressive Gospel 
</h3>
<p>
When Peter returned from Caesarea to Jerusalem, he found there many zealous disciples who contended with him for going into Cornelius’ house and eating with the Gentiles. Such an act was unthinkable to the Jerusalem Christians, for it transgressed their recognised code of ethics; but Peter recounted the matter from the beginning and expanded it to them. Peter ended his defence with the words, <font color= "blue">“Who was I, that I could withstand God?” (Acts 11:17)</font> <br>When they heard these words the disciples no longer questioned but held their peace and glorified God, saying:<br><font color= "blue"> “Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life.” (Acts 11:18)</font> These were true disciples, for they willingly gave up their conflicting opinions when the will of God was shown to them.</p>
<p>
Some people dislike progress, especially religious progress. While the church carries on in the same old pattern of the past, all is well; but when progressive plans to further the Gospel are instituted and carried out these type of people quickly censure the methods being inaugurated.<br> “The church is not as it used to be,” some will say; and others, “A grave mistake is being made”; or, “This has never been done before.”<br> God is the Founder of the Church. Let Him make the changes in church policy that are necessary. Our part is to be stalwart Christians to the point that we can recognise and carry out God’s ordained plans.</p>
<p>
God does not change, nor does His plan of salvation; but the ways and means that God uses to reach the hearts of sinful men sometimes do change.<br> The man or woman who sets his heart against the changes that God institutes will find himself ill at ease in the very place where once he felt the finest fellowship. No one can stop growing in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ and at the same time keep in step with Christ’s progressive Church. The unprogressive church is not Christ’s Church.</p>
<h3>
Originality 
</h3>
<p>
While some men are against a progressive program in the church, other men seem eager to be always original -– never wanting to follow in another’s footsteps. There is great danger of being too radical in either direction.<br> The man will often seem to be original, however, who faithfully carries out the perfect will of God. God will inspire His children to thoughts and actions that could never have been their own; but how careful must the Christian be in these matters to be sure that they are of God. All inspiration that comes from God agrees with the Word of God. Peter did not act on a solitary thought.<br> God made His will clear through a series of demonstrations and inspirations until Peter was sure of God’s intended meaning. Even the dissenters agreed with Peter when they heard his explanation.</p>
<h2 align="center">
Paul
</h2>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Now when they had gone through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia. After they had come to Mysia, they tried to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit did not permit them.” <br>(Acts 16:6-7).</font>
<h3>
Led by the Spirit in Ministry
</h3>
<p>
The Apostle Paul was called and anointed by the Lord to preach the Gospel. Throughout his ministry, he was led by the Spirit. When he was out travelling and preaching in the region of Galatia, Paul had a team with him, and he said “they” wanted to go and preach the Word in Asia, but “they” were forbidden by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h3>
The Majority Can Be Wrong
</h3>
<p>
Notice that Paul had a group of people with him in the work.<br> Paul said, “they” tried to go into Bithynia, but “the Spirit did not permit them.” The majority is not always right. Even a great team of people need to seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit. So what did they do? Did they go anyway?<br>
No, they listened to the Holy Spirit and they stayed out of those areas and instead they went on to Troas. Based upon their own reasoning and judgement, Paul and his team would have gone to those areas. After all, they might have reasoned that there were people there who needed to hear the Gospel in those places.</p>
<h3>
A Wise Team Seeks, Yields and is Led by Holy Spirit
</h3>
<p>
What seemed right to them was over-ruled by the Holy Spirit. <br>They sought out and yielded to the leadership of the Holy Spirit in their faith assignment. This is precisely how you are to be led in your ministry, whatever the assignment.
In the end, Paul and his team went on to Troas and that is where he had a supernatural vision in the night, of a man pleading with him to come to Macedonia. Paul knew then that the Lord wanted them to preach in Macedonia and he went. This was a divine assignment.</p>
