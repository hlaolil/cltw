<h3>
The Voice of the Holy Spirit 
</h3>
<p>
Jesus told His disciples, <font color= "blue">“However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come.” (John 16:13).</font></p>

The Holy Spirit is available to those who have put their trust in Jesus Christ. He speaks to our hearts and leads us in the right direction when we learn to listen. The Holy Spirit has been described as wind (John 3:8), a dove (Mark 1:10), and a gift (Acts 2:38). The Spirit of God can be grieved and quenched by disobedient believers. However, it is possible to hear the voice of the Spirit when believers humble themselves to:</p>

Be Quiet
</h3>

“Come aside by yourselves to a deserted place and rest a while.” (Mark 6:31).</font></p>
<p>
We are sometimes too busy to hear the voice of the Holy Spirit. He is gentle and patiently waits for us to hunger for His presence in our lives. Being quiet before the Lord is more than just not talking. It’s quieting your anxious thoughts and meditating on His word as you wait to hear from the Holy Spirit. We need to find a good place where we can sit before God uninterrupted by other distractions.
The voice of the Holy Spirit is gentle and quiet—very difficult for us to hear when we don’t pay close attention.

Be Prepared

“Prepare the way for the Lord, make His paths straight.” (Mark 1:3).</font></p>
<p>
We must take the time to reflect on our words, actions, and thoughts if we want to hear from God. Our sins keep us from hearing the quiet voice of the Holy Spirit. By confessing and repenting of our sins—we allow the Spirit of God to come into our hearts that has been cleansed by the Lord. The more we grow in our relationship with God, the more sensitive we become to the presence of sin.</p>
<h3> 
Be Aware
</h3>

“Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, “If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed. And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” (John 8:31-32).</font></p>
<p>
It’s difficult to hear from the Holy Spirit when we don’t know the Bible. We are most familiar with the word of God through the hearing and teaching of it. Also through personal memorisation, meditation, and personal study—believers can know the truths of God’s word. Everything the Holy Spirit speaks to our hearts will line up perfectly with Scripture. Through consistent exposure of the Bible, we will gain greater confidence in hearing the voice of the Spirit</p>
