 <h1>
A Supernatural Teacher
</h1>
<h3>
Jesus' Promise 
</h3>
<p>
Jesus had spoken only the Father's words, but His disciples always had trouble understanding Him during His earthly ministry.<br> For example,<font color= "blue">"His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about Him and that they had done these things to Him." (John 12:16)</font><br> Jesus said to His disciples, <font color= "blue">"I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now." (John 16:12)</font></p>
<p>
Now He was turning over His teaching of His disciples to the Holy Spirit, who would dwell in them: <br><font color= "blue">"These things I have spoken to you while being present with you. But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you." <br>(John 14:25-26).</font> <br>For three years Jesus had been teaching them the Father's truth, but they never understood much. Now He would send a Teacher that would dwell within them.</p>
<p>
Because of that wonderful promise, the disciples were later able to recall the precise words Jesus had spoken to them. Once they recorded them as Scripture, those words would be perfect and error free. In addition, the Spirit revealed new truth to them. Those whom God chose wrote it all down, resulting in the Word of God as we have it today. To deny the accuracy or the integrity of the Bible is to deny this crucial aspect of the Spirit's ministry.</p>
<h3>
The Holy Spirit is Still Our Teacher
</h3>
<p>
The Holy Spirit's main role to us is that of teacher. John 14:26 says that the Spirit teaches "all things." That does not mean He imparts to us some kind of omniscience. "All things" is used here in a relative sense. <br>It speaks of <font color= "blue">"all things that pertain to life and godliness" (2 Peter 1:3).</font></p>
<p>
How does the promise that the Holy Spirit will instruct us and bring all things to our memory apply today? The Spirit guides us in our pursuit of truth through the Word of God. He teaches us by convicting us of sin, affirming truth in our hearts, and opening our understanding to the depth of God's revealed truth.<br> As you've probably experienced many times, He often brings to mind appropriate verses and truths from Scripture at just the night moment.</p>
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
Nothing can take the place of the Holy Spirit's work in the life of the believer. Through Him we are <font color= "blue">"heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ," (Rom 8:17).</font> <br>We are infinitely richer than all the billionaires of the world put together because what we possess is an eternal inheritance.</p>
<p>
Paul, quoting the prophet Isaiah, wrote,<font color= "blue"> “Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love Him" (1 Cor 2:9).</font><br> Christians are rich beyond imagination. And the greatest resource of all--the Holy Spirit--dwells in us and is with us forever.</p>
