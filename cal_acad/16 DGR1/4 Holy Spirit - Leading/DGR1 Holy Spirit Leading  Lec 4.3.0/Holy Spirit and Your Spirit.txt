<h1>
Holy Spirit and Man's Spirit
</h1>
<h3>
Guided
</h3>
<p>
Your human spirit guides you by conviction, but the Holy Spirit guides you by revelation and through spiritual gifts to make you walk in God's perfect will for your life.</p>
 <p>
Conviction is about being strong in all things that are within truth and that is right to do in all godliness that you have known and that you have built into your life through faith in God, through Scripture, and by good parental upbringing. Conviction is what you know for sure that makes your life solid in the world and conviction gives you the energy and lifestyle that draws and keeps the kind of people and things around you that are in your life now. But the Holy Spirit guides you around specifics and what you should be doing with your life and guides the steps that you should be taking in life both now and in the long-run. </p>
<h3>
The Direction and Purpose of Your Life
</h3>
 <p>
The culture of your life style and conviction could indicate more than one option of what direction to take and of what you can do with our life. But the Holy Spirit reveals what has the potential for your peace, protection and your overall purpose in God and life.</p> 
 <p>
So, by conviction something might look right and yet might need revelation from the Lord about it for clearance whether or not to go that route with your life or, if or not to marry a certain person. Because everything might look and read right and convincing but might not be what God has in mind for you. The Holy Spirit, as Jesus said, will, Draw from the mind of God to give us the mind of Christ which is God's perfect will to be walking with (John 16:14-15).</p>
 <p>
This means your born again spirit can guide you to proven truth and, what is clear to every believer, according to the Scriptures. But the Holy Spirit on the other hand guides you to what is specific for you, what belongs only to you, your future and your peace, even if (at times) it is not obvious to see. Meaning that, you can get the go-ahead to do something before you are convinced about it, and you can be convinced about a thing because your heart is open to it. Your spirit holds tightly to it but might still need the go-ahead for it from the Holy Spirit as to whether this is God's will for you in order to proceed with it.</p>
 <p>
Both your spirit and the Holy Spirit guide by the truth. But the difference at times is: The truth of your spirit builds your community, while the truth of the Holy Spirit guides your purpose, your destiny and your  spiritual heritage.</p>
 <p>
And also, the Holy Spirit with a holistic eternal knowledge (Omniscience) can guide you to what is the truth, but that is in the future, and it will be your responsibility to feed yourself spiritually to be strong for it and wait for and protect what is true and right for your future. But your human spirit can also be convinced about what is true in the present because of Scripture, principles and what is traditionally and culturally right, but also what could be temporal for you to do, or what could be short-lived and that might not be there in the future. Because your spirit though truthful to you and to your conscience, only has temporal discernment on its own and is not Omniscient. </p> 
<p>
This means your own spirit might be presumptuous at times about what the will of God is, if you don't know how to yield to or hear from the Holy Spirit. Because the Holy Spirit is the Author of the Scriptures you might be quoting, He inspires and guides in the specifics within the will of God for our life. It is only the Holy Spirit that has and that can access the eternal plan of God for you, to give you peace on earth and to help you fulfil your spiritual destiny in Christ in the world.</p>
 <h3>
Relationship with the Holy Spirit 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, Nor have entered into the heart of man The things which God has prepared for those who love Him.” But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit (the Holy Spirit). For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.  For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so no one knows the things (will, plan and purpose) of God except the Spirit of God." (1 Cor. 2:9-11)</font></p>
 <p>
When you feed your spirit man to be strong in and through what is being revealed to you by the Holy Spirit, your spirit will be able to give you the mental, moral and emotional support for the future you should be creating, be entering into or should be waiting for. Because God doesn't deal with your soul directly, but with your spirit, so that your spirit being divinely empowered should become a strong pillar for your soul, by spiritual structure and godly discernment. </p>
 <p>
This means you need a healthy relationship with the Holy Spirit to walk in the perfect will of God and to creating your authentic future or enter it.
<p><font color= "blue">"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God." (Rom 8:14)</font>
Conviction is about the parameters of life and lifestyle that your spirit man gives your conscience peace about. While the revelation, light and guidance are imparted by the Holy Spirit, but most times they come with the power to live them by creating or release in us of a new strength that increases our conviction. So, conviction can be treated as a Part of spiritual truth held by our spirit for us to live by. While revelation from the Holy Spirit is either an Ongoing light that keeps illuminating our path, or a Specific light for clarity on a the particular direction that we need to take in our life.</p>
