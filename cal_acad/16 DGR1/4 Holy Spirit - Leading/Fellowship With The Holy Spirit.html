 <h1>
Fellowship With The Holy Spirit
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit, be with you all." (2 Cor 13:14)</font></p> 
<p>
The Word of God reveals the thoughts of God, concerning all aspects of human life. It follows, therefore, that communion between the believer and the Holy Spirit must be centred upon the Word of God. The Holy Spirit can in no way contradict the Word, for He is sent to bear witness of its truth. <br>That which is contradictory to the Scriptures is not the fruit of communion with the Holy Spirit, so the Word is always the criteria for determining the nature of that which is in question. Emotional feelings, personal preference, or any other aspect of the natural disposition cannot be used as the criteria to determine whether or not something is of God.</p> 
<p>
The eternal communion and divine participation of the Trinity is shared with each believer and by the Body of Christ in "communion with the Holy Spirit." Having communion with the Holy Spirit means thinking with the same thoughts according to God's Word and doing the same type of activities. <br>This sharing and fellowshipping together solidifies the bond between the participants and brings joy into the heart because of righteousness. </p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Therefore if there is any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and mercy, (Phil 2:1)</font></p>
<p>
We should not be misled by the word "if" in the above verse. Paul is not stating a "maybe." He is stating an absolute fact. That word "if" is better understood as "since".<br><font color= "blue"> "Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering; bearing with one another, and forgiving one another," (Col 3:12-13)</font></p> 
<p><font color= "blue">"fulfil my joy by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind." (Phil 2:2)</font></p>
<p>
Because of God's calling, because He granted us repentance and gave us His Spirit, we have already been enabled by His spirit to use these things to make peace, to be of one accord, to be of one mind. "The mark of the beast" can be overcome by God's Spirit in us, but we must sacrifice ourselves to use it. <br>It is already there. Thus, Paul is saying, "Use God's love in you, and be of one mind. Stop fighting with each other to gain the upper hand. Consider the other person better than you, and serve him by looking out for his interest."</p>
<p>
When he says, "Let this mind be in you," what he literally says in the Greek is, "Keep thinking like this." How? As Jesus Christ has already shown us.<br> He is saying, "Don't let your mind be drawn toward what you consider to be the cause of the offence." Or, "Don't dwell upon those things."</p>
