Following the Witness
</h1>
<h3>
Trust
</h3>
<p>
As David talks about the conquest he has in God over his enemies, he offers light on what it means to look to God rather than self in trying times.<br> His illumination will offer the next step we should take once we make sure we keep a clear mind by casting all our insecurities on the cross.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“For You will light my lamp; the Lord my God will enlighten my darkness.” <br>(Psa 18:28).</font> </p>
<p>
David trusts the Lord for continued favour. But the key item I want to connect to our discussion is that God lightens our darkness. David is trusting in the Lord for provision in dark places. Anxiousness is never pleasant; it’s always dark.</p>
<p>
Thus we should trust in the Lord to bring clarity to the areas that sin has covered with darkness. Trusting in God is usually the last thing we want to do when worried about something. It is always an inward focus, one looking to self to evaluate the course of action to take in light of the enclosing circumstance. There tends to be this fog that won’t go away. We are busy, frantic, and worried. We need clarity.</p>
<p>
And more than anything we need clarity because sin covers everything with darkness. In our fallen world, darkness abounds; but as Paul says, where sin abounds, grace abounds all the more (Rom. 5:20). Putting into practice that we must consciously (our mind) choose to trust in the Lord to bring clarity to the areas that sin has covered with darkness, in whatever situation, will prove to be fruitful in our conquest with God to overcome anxiety.</p>
<h3>
Move Forward
</h3>
<p>
Imagine that anxiety is a large enemy force who is coming against you to gain total victory over your life. A lot of times, anxiety plays precisely this role: <br>a dominant force in our lives that offer us no rest because it’s always out on the battle lines, lines we are constantly crossing. Another way to see or understand our sin (anxiety is sin) is by seeing a big wall in front of us that is impossible to get over. Again, while in the battle front of anxiety, we often view it as a wall that can’t be breached or crossed. Just the thought of not being able to overcome this enemy or this wall has an overwhelming affect that greatly discourages the Christian who is the most concerned with getting help.<br> What do we do?</p>
<p>
Like David, we look up to our only help:<br> <font color= "blue">“For by You I can run against a troop, by my God I can leap over a wall” <br>(Psa 18:29).</font><br> We move forward knowing only God can help us and give us success.<br> This is very important. Anxiety is paralysing. Like when a person is frozen in bed because they think they hear someone in their kitchen in the middle of the night, so anxiety puts a hold on healthy decision making.</p>
<p>
An anxious person is an indecisive person. They can never make up their mind. An anxious person is a fearful person; these two are closely related. <br>Someone who is driven by fear is driven with anxiety. And when this happens, the ability to choose the best course of action will be hindered because they will be driven by anxiety that causes them to then fear about what they are doing, and so they can’t decide. Remembering to move forward knowing only God can help you and give you success grants you freedom from an anxious life and to give glory to God for His great power and sovereignty in your overcoming anxiety.</p>
<p>
Jesus Christ is the Lord of a Christian. He is the Master of the whole person. Jesus Christ must take precedence over the mind, emotions, and will. <br>Jesus will use whatever means necessary to have our hearts. Anxiety can be a very useful tool for our gracious Master to employ in order that we look up, as David did, to Him.</p>
<p>
God’s sovereignty reigns over anxiety. God choosing to allow anxiety run our lives for a time is a choice not haphazardly decided, nothing God allows or does in our lives is random. <br>Everyone who is able to rest by being “in Christ” is able to look to God as a gracious Father who deeply cares about their peace.<br> The God of all comfort (2 Cor 1:3) will dominant His children with the love of Christ that even anxiety will have to flee so that the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, might guard their hearts and minds (Phil 4:7).</p>
