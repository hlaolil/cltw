<h3>
God's Gift
</h3>
<p>
God the Father has given God the Holy Spirit as a gift to all disciples of God the Son, Jesus, in the "Age of the Spirit" (Pentecost, until His second coming) so that we have the power necessary to cope with all the Spirit requires of us on a day--to--day, moment--by--moment, event--by--event basis in the physical and the spiritual worlds. He gives us patience to deal with leaky water beds, love so that we can deal with a troublesome neighbour, and wisdom and strength to stand against principalities and powers, the dark forces of the air.</p>
<p>
God the Holy Spirit is given to all of us in the age of the Spirit to cope with reality. He is given to us so that we can see that all that the circumstances which He brings into our lives are God-directed and God-motivated.<br> Nothing just "happens" to the children of God. God is using His Spirit in us to influence His plan of redemption so that people will come to, know Him.<br> Next time you get a flat tyre you should say' "Lord, whom do You want me to meet? How do You want me to react?" We need to be Spirit--conscious because the spirit is in us, using us to the glory and honour of God. <br>What a difference the Holy Spirit makes in our lives!</p>
<p>
What a difference the Holy Spirit made when He came into, the lives of the early disciples! There was a notable difference in them after Pentecost, when the Spirit came upon them. For example, during the post--resurrection period we observed a group of despondent, discouraged disciples. all their hopes and dreams were destroyed, scattered and shattered. They were walking around, rehashing old history about Jesus, the prophet who was.</p>
<p>
When Jesus appeared to them the first time, their hearts were again filled with joy and peace, but they had no power to do what God had asked of them. Before the crucifixion, Jesus had said to them, "You have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you, and appointed you that you should bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain. I command you that you love one another." The disciples had the joy, the peace and the instructions on what to do, but they had no power because the Spirit of God had not yet come upon them. <br>God had another plan in the "Age of the Spirit. </p>
<p>
We found that the disciples had moved from Jerusalem to Galilee where they waited obediently for the Lord to appear. When Jesus appeared they had a time of fellowship, a time of love and tenderness at the breakfast which He had prepared for them. Then there was a time of the Lord's testing of Peter to see if he were still qualified to be shepherd of the Lord's sheep. In that time we discovered that Peter learned humility, but he had no power to be a shepherd because the Spirit had not yet come.</p>
<p>
The disciples went back in Jerusalem on the fortieth day after the resurrection, waiting for what the Father had promised. The Lord had said, "You will be baptised with the Holy Spirit," so that they could be witnesses for Christ before the whole world, Jews and Gentiles. So here are the eleven apostles together with 109 disciples gathered in Jerusalem, available, but having no power to be witnesses that God had called them to be because the Holy Spirit had not yet been given. Let us see what a difference the Holy Spirit makes in the lives of these struggling Galileans, these fishermen, farmers and carpenters, just regular people.</p>
<h3>
A Time Of Waiting 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
The first account I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, until the day which He was taken up, after He had by the Holy Spirit given commandments to the apostles whom He had chosen. to whom He also presented Himself alive after His suffering, by many infallible proofs, being seen by them during  forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God. And being assembled together with them, He commanded them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait the Promise of the Father, "Which," He said, "you heard of from Me; for John truly baptised with water, but you shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit not many days from now. (Acts 1:1-5)</font></p>
<p>
Luke, the Greek physician, may have come to know the Lord under Paul's ministry. He wrote to Theophilus, another Greek (his name means "lover of God"), a very accurate account about all that Jesus began to do and teach. <br>(That first account is called the gospel of Luke.) In this, the second account, Luke amplifies the first 11 verses of the last chapter of his gospel and then goes on to write about the ministry of the Spirit.</p>
<h3>
By the Spirit
</h3>
<p>
By the Spirit, the disciples would continue Jesus' work.<br>
Luke wanted Theophilus to know that the post-resurrection appearances of Jesus were not only to prove to the disciples that He was risen from the dead, but to show them that the Spirit of God would come upon them to continue the ministry of Jesus through them. This would be a ministry of redemption, the calling out of people throughout the whole world, Jews, Samaritans and Gentiles. So Luke is writing to Theophilus a 30-year history of the early church, called the Book of Acts.</p>
<p>
We read in Acts 1:4 that Jesus commanded the disciples to wait. I think the hardest thing in the world is to wait on the Lord. I have so many things that could be accomplished if God would only buy into my program!<br> We don't want to wait because we don't understand what God is doing.<br> But here the disciples are faced with a time of waiting. God had picked them and He would continue to encourage them and instruct them.</p>
<p>
We, in turn, are also encouraged and instructed, because Luke writes and shares with us some of the things that took place then. He tells us that Jesus had given orders by the Holy Spirit to the apostles, whom He had chosen.<br> Here is the key that unlocks the mystery of our Lord's ministry in His humanity, as well as His ministry with us in His; post--resurrection, new, eternal body: Jesus still functioned by the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
