<h3>
Ignorance
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent,” (Acts 17:30).</font> </p>
<p>
Peter applied this same theme of excused ignorance to the Jews who rejected Jesus (Acts 3:17).  <br>It is of fundamental significance that they [the Gentiles] are called from where they began, just as were the Jews. Their times of ignorance are not treated any differently than the ignorance that excused the first rejection of Jesus the Prophet by the Jewish people.</p>
<p>
Paul notes that God patiently tolerated human ignorance in ages past <br>(Rom 3:25).<br> In Lystra, Paul says that God <font color= "blue">“allowed all nations to walk in their own ways” (Acts 14:16).</font> <br>While God “overlooks” sin, there is also retribution for people who suppress the truth about His eternal power and divine nature — He lets sin have its natural results (Rom 1:18-32).</p>
<p>
But times had changed; a new beginning in God’s dealing with the human race had begun. Forgiveness for sin and intimate contact with God through the Holy Spirit was possible. Repentance and acceptance of Jesus as Saviour is commanded. The days of groping in the dark and spiritual ignorance are over. The day of repentance is here and the time of judgement is coming.</p>
<p>
Paul warned the Areopagus that his speech was not just idle philosophical speculation. His call to repentance was very serious because God has <br><font color= "blue">“appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness ...” <br>(Acts 17:31).</font> (The quote is from Psa 96:13) <br>The New Testament makes clear in many places that a “day of judgement” is coming. The offer of salvation in Christ is counterpoised with the warning of judgement for those who reject Him. </p>
