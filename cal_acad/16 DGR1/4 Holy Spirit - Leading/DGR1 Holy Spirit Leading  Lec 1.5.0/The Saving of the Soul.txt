<h1>
The Saving of the Soul
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
Therefore lay aside all filthiness and overflow of wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls. (James 1:21)</font></p>

God's Kingdom and the World

The soul still needs saving or James would not need to write to believers to save their souls. The soul is the mind and personality. Can anyone of us really say that our minds and personalities are completely saved? Not really.<br>
However, when we were born again, our spirits were saved. Our spirits is the part of us that has been saved. So becoming a child of God enables the Holy Spirit to testify with our spirit that we are God’s children. The Spirit does not testify to our minds. Our minds may not receive this testimony, but our spirits can.
Now you can understand how vital it is that your spirit hears from God.</p>

A prevalent strategy that Satan seeks to introduce into your life is to get you to leave the kingdom rule of Jesus Christ and come back over to his. Much of this happens through the division of the secular and the sacred. This is done when you attend and participate in church under one kingdom, then you go out into the world Monday to Saturday and function there under the influence of another kingdom. You might do a Bible study in one kingdom, then do your socialising under the influence of the world view of the other kingdom—Satan’s domain.<br> 
Essentially, when you flip-flop kingdoms depending on the activity you are participating in, or the day of the week, you do not fully actualise or experience the victory and rule that comes with the abundant life in Christ.</p>
<p>
Satan ends up ruling people’s lives because they are yielding the power to him—not by way of any rightful authority that he has but simply because of a failure to align their thoughts and decisions under the Lordship of Jesus Christ. By not giving Jesus Christ the proper place in your home, church, work, relationships, entertainment choices, and wherever, you lose the full presence of His covering.</p>
