 <h1>
Guidance Through Visions
</h1>
<h3>
Old Testament Visions
</h3>
<p>
Throughout the Bible, God communicates with His people through visionary experiences. In Gen 15, the Lord speaks to Abraham in a vision (Gen 15:1).<br> A few chapters later, God speaks to the gentile king Abimelech in a dream <br>(Gen 20:3). So it goes throughout the Old Testament stories. </p>
<p>
If we were to think that things like this happened only for biblical characters, the promise of Joel corrects that misconception. Several centuries before Christ, the Lord spoke through this Jewish prophet:<br>
<font color= "blue">And it shall come to pass afterwards that I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh;
your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions. And also on My menservants and on My maidservants I will pour out My Spirit in those days. (Joel 2:28-29).</font></p>
<h3>
New Testament Visions
</h3>
<p>
The New Testament begins on a similar note, with an angel appearing in a dream to Joseph, telling him that his fiancée is pregnant by the Holy Spirit <br>(Matt 1:20). Not long afterwards, Joseph receives direction to go to Egypt as, once again, an angel speaks to him in a dream (Matt 2:13).</p>
<p>
Seven weeks after Jesus' resurrection, God poured out His Spirit as promised by Joel. <br>Peter, preaching the first Christian sermon on the Jewish festival of Pentecost, quotes from Joel's prophecy to explain what has happened to the followers of Jesus who have just received the filling of the Spirit (Acts 2:16-21). <br>The fulfilment of this prophecy at this time implies that Christians, both old and young, will experience divine guidance through dreams and visions.</p>
<h3>
Holy Spirit Guides Through Visions
</h3>
<p>
The rest of the book of Acts illustrates this implication as the Holy Spirit guides the early Christians through extraordinary visual experiences. <br>In Acts 16, for example, the Spirit at first spoke to Paul and Silas, telling them not to evangelise in the Roman provinces of Asia and Bithynia. <br>Then Paul had a vision in the night, in which a man from northern Greece asked him, <font color= "blue">“Come over to Macedonia and help us.” (Acts 16:9)</font> The evangelists quickly left for that region, believing that God had called them to preach there .</p> 
<p>
Later on, when Paul’s ministry in Corinth brought on Jewish wrath, God inspired and affirmed Paul through another vision:
One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision and told him, <font color= "blue">“Do not be afraid, but speak, and do not keep silent; for I am with you, and no one will attack you to hurt you; for I have many people in this city.” And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them (Acts 18:9-11)</font> </p>
<p>
Of course, as we have noted with respect to other forms of guidance, that which we derive from dreams and visions must also be tested by Scripture in the context of prayerful, reasonable Christian community.<br> Throughout history, heretical theologies have often originated in the visions of their founders, visions inspired by something other than the Holy Spirit. <br>The New Testament letter from Jude refers to false teachers as <font color= "blue">“dreamers” (Jude 1:8).</font> <br>But, for those of us inclined to exalt rationality (reality) far above visions, I will dare to say that most modern heresy stems from thinking, not dreaming.</p>
