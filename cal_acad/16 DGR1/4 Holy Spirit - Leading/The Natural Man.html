 <h1>
The Natural Man
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
And you He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins, in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience, among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, just as the others. (Eph 2:1-3)</font></p>
<p>
In this part of his epistle, Paul shows what sinful people are like. He then shows what we can become by the grace of God. Jesus died, but God raised Him to life. God then put Him in a very high place in heaven. It is just like that for us.<br>  We were dead, but God raised us too. He placed us together with Jesus. <br>We are close to Jesus. We are in heaven with Him. This is true even whilst we live on earth.</p>
<h3>
All people are Sinners. 
</h3>
<p>
Paul first makes this clear in Eph 2:1. He says, "You were dead in trespasses and sins and because you did not obey God." And then in Eph 2:3, Paul says: "We all used to live like them." We are all sinners.<br>
Often you fail to be the person that God wants you to be. That is sin. <br>Often you do not live as God wants you to live. That is sin.<br> You also sin when you do something wrong.<br> But sometimes you do not do something that you should do. That is sin too.<br>
The old way to live moves away from God. This old life, says Paul, is the way that we all used to live (Eph 2:3). Every thing that we did was against God.<br> It moved away from God. It moved in the direction of evil things.<br> Either we can walk with God or we can walk away from him. <br>Paul speaks about this wrong way to live in three ways:</p>
<p><font size="+1">
First</font></p>
<p>
It is when you used to copy the bad ways of the people in the world<br> (non-Christians). In the Greek language, it means people who belong to the age of this world. In the world, there are different systems. They could be political, social or money systems. The age of this world might apply to any of these.<br> It could refer to any system that does not have God in it. The people in these systems do not think about God. They do not discuss things with Him.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Second</font></p>
<p>
For the king who rules the spiritual forces in the air. This means Satan, who is the head of all the evil spirits. We cannot see them. However, they are there and they work in the world trying to influence us.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Third</font></p>
<p>
They belonged to the one who now controls the people who do not obey God’s rules. Paul tells us that, He is a spirit. Again this means Satan.<br>
We have this sinful nature as the result of Adam’s sin. It means that I am at the centre of my life. Apart from God, I live with me at the centre. I think about myself. And I do what I want to do.</p>
<h3>
Our Wrong Physical Desires Anger God
</h3>
<p>
There is nothing wrong with physical desires. We have many of these.<br> Some desires are for food, sleep or sex. God made our body to want these things. But they are wrong when we eat too much. They are wrong when we sleep too much. They are wrong when we have sex outside marriage.<br>
Paul says that we all did what our physical body wanted. God was angry with us. We all have Adam’s sinful nature. It comes to us by Adam’s sin.<br>  By his sin, we share his sinful nature. That is how we are children of Adam.</p>
<p>
We need to understand the meaning of "God was angry with us". It does not mean that He is in a bad temper. Nor that He hates us and He wants to punish us. God’s anger (or wrath) means that He is always an enemy of evil things.<br>  He hates evil things. He hates them very much. He never stops hating them. This is because He is God. He is a righteous God.<br>  By His very nature, He cannot stop being angry against sin.</p>
