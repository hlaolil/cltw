The Basis of Peace	
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
“These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world." (John 16:33)</font></p>
<p>
Jesus spoke these words to His disciples after revealing to them that He would soon be departing from them.  What a comfort we have in the word! <br>Christ’s statement in this verse can be broken down into three parts. </p>
<p>
First, that we may have peace through Him. <br>Jesus told His disciples that He would soon go to the Father. <br><font color= "blue">“In that day you will ask in My name, and I do not say to you that I shall pray the Father for you; for the Father Himself loves you, because you have loved Me, and have believed that I came forth from God. I came forth from the Father and have come into the world. Again, I leave the world and go to the Father.” (John 16:26-28)</font>.<br> With Jesus at the right hand of God as our intercessor we can have peace.</p>
<p>
Second, we are told that we will have tribulation in the world. <br>This is an inevitable reality and should not come as a surprise. <br>Tribulation was certainly familiar to the early Christians. Most were persecuted, even to the point of death. Stephen, Peter, and Paul are obvious examples that come to mind. <br><font color= "blue">"Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you; but rejoice to the extent that you partake of Christ's sufferings, that when His glory is revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy. If you are reproached for the name of Christ, blessed are you, for the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. On their part He is blasphemed, but on your part He is glorified. But let none of you suffer as a murderer, a thief, an evildoer, or as a busybody in other people's matters. Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this matter".  (1 Peter 4:12-16)</font>. <br>Peter suggests that we should rejoice in suffering in Christ’s name as it is a way that we may glorify God.<br> <font color= "blue">"My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials, knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. But let patience have its perfect work, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing. (James 1:2-4)</font>.<br> Here we can see that facing trials can refine us and create in us a more complete Christian. Of course, we cannot ever forget the ultimate suffering that Christ endured on our behalf.</p>
<p>
The last point to draw from this statement of farewell from Christ is that we should be of good cheer, or have courage (in other translations). <br>What could encourage us more than the fact that Jesus had overcome the world? Our Saviour faced all the temptations that we do and never wavered. <br>He lived the perfect life. He knew at this point that He would soon be put to death and then be resurrected, to return to the Father. Thus He conquered death and effectively defeated Satan, the prince of the world. Jesus ransomed us through His death and is able to deliver us from the power of sin in the world. Death no longer holds power over us! Knowing this we should not become overwhelmed by the trials of this world.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Therefore we will not fear, Even though the earth be removed, And though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea; Though its waters roar and be troubled, Though the mountains shake with its swelling. Selah There is a river whose streams shall make glad the city of God, The holy place of the tabernacle of the Most High  (Psa 46:2-4)</font></p>
