Inherit the Earth

The third beatitude puzzles many people in the workplace, in part because they don’t understand what it means to be meek. Many assume the term means weak, tame, or deficient in courage. But the biblical understanding of meekness is power under control. In the Old Testament, Moses was described as the meekest man on earth. <font color= "blue">Now the man Moses was very humble, more than all men who were on the face of the earth (Num 12:3)</font>. Jesus described Himself as <font color= "blue">“gentle and lowly in heart,” (Matt 11:28-29)</font>, which was consistent with his vigorous action in cleansing the temple (Matt 21:12-13).</p>
<p>
Power under God’s control means two things: <br>
(1) refusal to inflate our own self-estimation; and<br> 
(2) reticence to assert ourselves for ourselves. <br>
Paul captures the first aspect perfectly:<font color= "blue"> “through the grace given to me, to everyone who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, as God has dealt to each one a measure of faith.” (Rom 12:3)</font> Meek people see themselves as servants of God, not thinking more highly of themselves than they ought to think. To be meek is to accept our strengths and limitations for what they truly are, instead of constantly trying to portray ourselves in the best possible light. But it does not mean that we should deny our strengths and abilities. When asked if He was the Messiah, Jesus replied, <font color= "blue">“The blind see and the lame walk; the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear; the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached to them. And blessed is he who is not offended because of Me” (Matt 11:5-6)</font>. He had neither an inflated self-image nor an inferiority complex, but a servant’s heart based on what Paul would later call <font color= "blue">“to think soberly” (Rom 12:3)</font></p>
<p>
A servant’s heart is the crux of the second aspect of meekness: reticence to assert ourselves for ourselves. We exercise power, but for the benefit of all people, not just ourselves. The second aspect begins with, <font color= "blue">“Do not fret because of evildoers,”</font> and ends with <font color= "blue">“But the meek shall inherit the earth, ...” (Psa 37:1,11)</font> It means we curb our urge to avenge the wrongs done against us, and instead use whatever power we have to serve others. It flows from the sorrow for our own weaknesses that comprises the second beatitude. If we feel sorrow for our own sins, can we really feel vengeful over the sins of others?</p>
<p>
It can be very challenging to put our power at work under God’s control. In the fallen world, it seems to be the aggressive and the self-promoting who get ahead. “You don't get what you deserve, you get what you negotiate.” In the workplace, the arrogant and powerful seem to win, but in the end they lose. They don’t win in personal relationships. No one wants an arrogant, self-seeking friend. Men and women who are hungry for power are often lonely people. Nor do they win in financial security. They think they possess the world, but the world possesses them. The more money they have, the less financially secure they feel.</p>

In contrast, Jesus said that the meek “will inherit the earth.” As we have seen, the earth has become the location of the kingdom of heaven. We tend to think of the kingdom of heaven as heaven, a place completely different (golden streets, gates of pearl, a mansion over the hilltop) from anything we know here. But God's promise of the kingdom is a new heaven and a new earth (Rev 21:1). Those who submit their power to God will inherit the perfect kingdom coming to earth. In this kingdom, we receive by God’s grace the good things the arrogant fruitlessly strive for in the present earth, and more. And this is not a future reality only. Even in a broken world, those who recognize their true strengths and weaknesses can find peace by living realistically. Those who exercise power for the benefit of others are often admired. The meek engage others in decision making and experience better results and deeper relationships.</p>
