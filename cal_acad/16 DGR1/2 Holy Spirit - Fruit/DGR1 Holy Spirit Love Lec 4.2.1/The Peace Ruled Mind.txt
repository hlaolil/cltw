Peace is active and powerful. It moves by the Spirit. It surpasses natural understanding. This article examines the supernatural power of peace and the role of the peacemaker who brings peace. It shows how peace operates and how it is activated.</p>
<h3>
Introducing Peace
</h3>
<p>
Jesus fought the battle and relies on believers to maintain the peace, as peacemakers. Peace is a fruit of the Spirit and a supernatural force which cannot be understood with the carnal mind. 
<font color= "blue">“The peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.” (Phil 4:7)</font>. 
It stills the heart and mind in the midst of difficult situations. The source of peace is the wisdom which Jesus speaks whether it is the written word of God or his spoken word. <font color= "blue">“These things I have spoken to you, so that in Me you may have peace” (John 16:33)</font>. Believers have been given the same peace Jesus operated with on the earth. <font color= "blue">“Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you;” (John 14:27).</font></p>
<h3>
Peacemakers
</h3>
<p>
Peacemakers are the ones who make peace through the power of the Spirit. Jesus is the ultimate peacemaker. His death and resurrection brought peace between God and man.<font color= "blue"> “Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ” (Rom 5:1).</font></p>
<p>
Some people live peaceably themselves but do not affect others peaceably. A peacemaker denotes a higher level of operation than simply living a peaceable life. A peacemaker deliberately affects other people, bringing peace where it has not existed before.<font color= "blue"> “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God” (Matt 5:9)</font>. Part of the manifestation of the sons of God is to bring peace wherever they go. This is the only verse with the word peacemakers, even though the word of God has much to say about peacemakers. These peacemakers are referred to as sons, who are mature believers. They love their enemies and are good to them and follow the Spirit (Luke 6:35 and Rom 8:14). These are the ones the Lord rewards and blesses above others.</p>
<p>
Every believer is a candidate for being a peacemaker. Faith and the power of the Spirit are required for a peacemaker. This faith is not just faith in the written word of God, but it is also faith in the spoken word of God for peace is proclaimed by peacemakers. Jesus said those who believed in the spoken word had great faith (Matt 8:5-13 and Mark 7:24-30). The power of the Spirit operates in and through peacemakers. The Spirit guides their proclamations and performs them.</p>
<h3>
Movement of Peace
</h3>
<p>
Peace moves like the dove which Noah sent out over the waters after the flood. He released a dove to see if the waters had receded, but it could find no resting place (Gen 8:8-12). The dove returned to the ark and later was sent out again. The second time it returned with an olive branch, indicating dry ground. The third time the dove was released it found a resting place and did not return to the ark. This dove, the Holy Spirit, now resides in every believer.</p>
<p>
When peace is proclaimed by a peacemaker, it moves and discerns and then it either rests or returns to the peacemaker. As believers enter a house, they are instructed to speak peace to it.<font color= "blue"> “Whatever house you enter, first say, "Peace to this house” (Luke 10:5)</font>. Peace is the first thing they are to proclaim. They do not ask permission to speak peace, nor do they determine whether the house is worthy of peace. They always speak peace. If a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; but if not, it will return to you (Luke 10:6). While those who rely on the arm of flesh are unable to receive peace, the sons of peace are inclined to receive peace. They are the ones who belong to the realm of peace, and they are not satisfied to remain in turmoil.</p>
<p>
Peace looks for a place to rest. It discerns when it can rest. When peace rests it makes a difference in lives and situations. If it cannot find rest it returns to the sender. If the gospel of peace is received it abides in a person’s heart, but if it is rejected it comes back to us.</p>
<h3>
Activating Peace by Peacemakers
</h3>
<p>
After the resurrection, Jesus appeared to the troubled disciples and spoke peace to them. <font color= "blue">
“When the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, "Peace be with you.” (John 20:19)</font>. Peacemakers bring peace by speaking peace to sons of peace who truly receive peace. They speak peace in the workplace, the marketplace, schools, hospitals, etc. They are not restricted to religious settings or traditions of men.</p>
<p>
Peacemakers are not limited by speaking peace only to sons of peace, because they can speak peace to any situation. He <font color= "blue">
“rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace, be still! and the wind ceased and there was a great calm” (Mark 4:39)</font>. Peacemakers can speak to the storms of life, as well as natural storms, and they will cease.</p>
<p>
Relationships are often tested through trials. When they are injured or broken, a peacemaker may be needed to restore the relationship. Peacemakers can reconcile those who are contending with each other. <font color= "blue">“... he appeared to two of them as they were fighting, and tried to reconcile them, saying, "Men, you are brethren; why do you wrong one another?” (Acts 7:26)</font>.</p>
<h3>
Conclusions
</h3>
<p>
The peace which Jesus gives is different from the peace of the world. Behind His peace is the power of the Spirit. It is not the absence of turmoil but the inward peace which changes situations when released. His peace is not hindered by anything but prevails over everything. The Spirit empowers peacemakers to speak words of peace which are effective. They proclaim peace out of a heart filled with peace. Their words make a difference in lives and situations. Peacemakers do not worry or discern whether people are worthy of peace. Peace will move, hover and discern whether it can rest. If peacemakers keep sending peace it will find a place to rest.</p>
<p>
Follow the Spirit higher and higher to another realm where peace reigns and joy fills the air. If peace rules your heart, you live above the world’s turmoil. You can live in peace even when everything around you is in turmoil, because Jesus has given you His peace. You can bring peace to others whose lives are in turmoil. Speak peace and end the turmoil!</p>
