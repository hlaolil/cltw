The Athletic Model
</h1>
<h3>
Physical Conditioning and Discipline
</h3>
<p>
To be good enough to win an Olympic medal, whether it be bronze, silver or gold, takes a tremendous amount of talent, skill and, for most of the events, a high degree of physical conditioning.  Preparing for an Olympic competition requires  discipline and perseverance. In the end the award that athletes receive is a medal, along with the distinction of being recognised as the world’s best athlete in their respective sport.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may obtain it. And everyone who competes for the prize is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a perishable crown, but we for an imperishable crown.” (1 Cor 9:24-25)</font></p>
<h3>
Running the Race of Life
</h3>
<p>
Our life as a Christian is like an Olympic athlete training to win a medal. Whereas the prize for the athlete is a medal, our prizes are at least two-fold.</p>
<p>
One prize is the abundant life that we are able to live because we are walking day to day with Jesus and by the power of the Holy Spirit.  The more disciplined we are at incorporating spiritual exercises into our lives on a daily basis, the more rewarding and fulfilling our life can be.  The more we live according to the guidebook that God gives us, the Bible, the sweeter our life can be.<br> God has this “prize” for us on this side of heaven.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly.” (John 10:10)</font></p>
<p>
Paul encourages the Corinthians to run the race of life with endurance and that the crown we will receive will last forever.  He encourages us to press on, to persevere, to endure.  As athletes require discipline in physical training and in what they eat to be competitive enough to win an Olympic medal, we must be disciplined in various forms of spiritual exercises to win the crown of a full and abundant life. (Cor 9:24-25)</p>
<p>
The more disciplined and consistent we are in our spiritual exercises, the more abundance we will tend to receive this side of heaven.  This is one reason Jesus died on the cross for you and for me.</p>
<p>
The other “prize” that God makes available for us is the crown of eternal life that we’ll spend with Jesus after we leave this earth.  It becomes available to us when we accept Jesus in our heart as our Saviour.  Isa 35:10 tells us that everlasting joy will crown the heads of those who walk with Jesus in a personal way.<br> Unlike the tarnish that will probably occur with the metal of the Olympic medals, our crown of everlasting life and our joy will continue forever.</p>
<p>
I encourage you to be disciplined in applying the principles of the Bible in such a way that you’re experiencing a full and rewarding life – the kind God desires for you.  And I pray that you are confident that you’ll live eternally in the presence of God because of a choice you’ve made to invite Jesus into your heart.</p>
