<h1>
A Fruit of Ministers
</h1>
<p>
Paul describes what it means to be a true servant of God.<br> 
<font color= "blue">"But in all things we commend ourselves as ministers of God: in much patience, in tribulations, in needs, in distresses, in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in labours, in sleeplessness, in fasting;" (2 Cor 6:4-5)</font></p>
<p>
I believe that what he was saying is that through all of the above, we as true servants of God go through some awful experiences yet, as a servant of God we express and show others by the way we live that we belong to Him. I am saying that although you crawl through the mud living through your circumstances, as a true servant of God, God's light within you still shines. People around you can still be encouraged, can still feel God's love within you, and still be strengthened through you as the result of the work which God has put in you to give to others. </p>
<p>
Whether you have thought about it, or believe it or not, we were all put on this earth to serve God and bring Him glory through the things we say and do. We are God's servants. The bible talks about this fact from the beginning to the end.</p>
<h3>
Hardships
</h3> 
<p><font color= "blue">
by purity, by knowledge, by longsuffering, by kindness, by the Holy Spirit, by sincere love, (2 Cor 6:6) </font></p>
<p>
How do we show and become true servants of God through our hardships? </p>
<p><font size="+1">
By Innocence and Purity </font></p>
<p>
We seek the innocence and purity of a child as we suffer, and go through all trials and tribulations. We find the purity in the relationship between offence and pain. We look for the innocence of the actions of the one who has hurt us. </p>
<p><font size="+1">
Knowledge and Spiritual Insight </font></p>
<p>
We must pray to God to give us His knowledge and spiritual enlightened as we are suffering. We must spend more time reading the bible and seeking spiritual teachings through books, church sermons, bible study, and through people, like spiritual leaders, and other believers.</p> 
<p><font size="+1">
Longsuffering, Patience and Kindness</font></p>
<p>
Although your pain may be long and your suffering may reach great depths stay in love, kindness, and have patience. </p>
<p><font size="+1">
In the Holy Spirit, in Unfeigned Love </font></p>
<p>
We can only do what is written above correctly through God, and through the Holy Spirit. This surpasses any earthly knowledge, wisdom, or worldly pride one can receive through anything else but through God alone. </p>
<p>
As we go about in our lives we all face things which we wish were not in our lives. We experience many things in our lives for numerous reasons. However, I tell you we can all be victorious with God through these things as well as others: hardships, trials and tribulations, long suffering, illness, and depression. We become victorious through our pain by abiding in God in all ways. We triumph over all things through and by His genuine love. Doing this entails a lot of different things. However, the bible explains how to do them all. </p>
<p>
Seek God's word, and no longer be trampled by the spiritual death which can/will consume you through sin, hardships, and destruction. Seek God, Jesus, and His Holy Spirit and be renewed through all of which you experience in your life! </p>
