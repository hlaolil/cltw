   <h1>
What is Gentleness
</h1>
<p>
The Holy Spirit works in us to be more like Christ (Eph 4:14-16), and part of the fruit, or results, of that work is gentleness.<br> Gentleness, also translated “meekness,” does not mean weakness.<br> Rather, it involves humility and thankfulness toward God, and polite, restrained behaviour toward others.<br> The opposites of gentleness are anger, a desire for revenge, and self-aggrandisement.
It takes a strong person to be truly gentle.</p>
<p>
God wants us to give Him control of our lives. Relying on our own logic, we have no impetus to submit to God's leadership. With the wisdom given to us by the Holy Spirit, however, we begin to see why we should completely submit to God as Lord of our lives. Human power under human control is a half-broken weapon in the hands of a child. But gentleness places our strength under God's guidance; it is a powerful tool for God's kingdom.</p>
<p>
Every person is powerful. We can speak words that influence others; we can act in ways that help or hurt; and we can choose what influences will inform our words and actions. Gentleness constrains and channels that power.<br> To be gentle is to recognise that God's ways and thoughts are high above our own (Isa 55:9). It is to humbly realise that our world views are shaped by exposure to sin and the misinterpretation of experience. It is to accept God's world view, reflecting truth about the spiritual and the material worlds.</p>
<p>
It is to our advantage to have a gentle attitude toward God because He is omniscient and we are not.<br> <font color= "blue">"Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth?"</font> God challenges Job.<font color= "blue"> "Tell Me, if you have understanding" (Job 38:4)</font>.<br> God knows everything of the past, present, and future (1 John 3:20); we can't even get the weather forecast right. Like a petulant teenager to his parents, we may cry out, "You just don't understand!" but God does understand, more than we could possibly know (Psa 44:21).</p>
<p>
When we are filled with the Spirit’s fruit of gentleness, we will correct others with easiness instead of arguing in resentment and anger, knowing that their salvation is far more important than our pride (2 Tim 24-25). <br>We will forgive readily, because any offence toward us is nothing compared to our offences against God—offences He's already forgiven (Matt 18:23-35). Competition and sectarianism will disappear, as the goal becomes less about ourselves and more about preaching the gospel (Phil 1:15-18).<br> John the Baptist was a fiery preacher, yet he evinced true gentleness when he said about Jesus,<font color= "blue"> “He must increase, but I must decrease” (John 3:30)</font>.</p>
<p>
Gentleness also means giving up the right to judge what is best for ourselves and others. God is not as concerned with our comfort as He is concerned with our spiritual growth, and He knows how to grow us far better than we do. Gentleness means that we accept that the rain falls on the evil and the just and that God may use methods we don't like to reach our hearts and the hearts of others.</p>
<p>
Finally, to live in a spirit of gentleness toward God is to accept His judgement on people and issues. We tend to think it is gentle to go easy on people and try to justify actions that God has called sin. Or to let someone continue in sin without speaking the truth.<br> But Paul says, <font color= "blue">"If a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness" (Gal 6:1)</font>. <br>This doesn't mean to be so soft that the sinner doesn't realise he's sinned. <br>It means to confront the brother in a manner that is in line with Scripture—to be mild, loving, encouraging, and clear about the holiness that God calls us to.</p>
<p>
Jesus gave us the perfect picture of gentleness:<br> <font color= "blue">“Behold, your King is coming to you,lowly, and sitting on a donkey,” <br>(Matt 21:5)</font>, and now He offers us His gentleness as a gift. <br>If we allow the Holy Spirit to lead us, we will be filled with fruit of gentleness.</p>
