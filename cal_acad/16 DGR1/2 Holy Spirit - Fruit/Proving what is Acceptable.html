   <h1>
Proving what is Acceptable
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
"for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, righteousness, and truth, finding out what is acceptable to the Lord". (Eph 5:9-10)</font></p>
<p>
Paul saw the heathen life as life in the dark; and the Christian life as life in the light. So vividly does he wish to put this that he does not say the heathen are children of the dark and the Christians children of the light; he says the heathen are dark and the Christians are light. He has certain things to say about the light which Jesus Christ brings to men.</p>
<p>
(i) The light produces good fruit. It produces benevolence, righteousness and truth. Benevolence (<i>agathosune</i>) is a certain generosity of spirit. The Greeks themselves defined righteousness (<i>dikaiosune</i>) as "giving to men and to God that which is their due." Truth (<i>aletheia</i>) is not in New Testament thought simply an intellectual thing to be grasped with the mind; it is moral truth, not only something to be known but something to be done. The light which Christ brings makes us useful citizens of this world; it makes us men and women who never fail in duty, human or divine; it makes us strong to do that which we know is true.</p>
<p>
(ii) The light enables us to discriminate between that which is well-pleasing and that which is not pleasing to God. It is in the light of Christ that all motives and all actions must be tested. In the bazaars of the east the shops are often simply little covered enclosures with no windows. A man might wish to buy a piece of silk or an article of beaten brass. Before he buys it he takes it out to the street and holds it up to the sun, so that the light might reveal any flaws which happen to be in it. It is the Christian's duty to expose every action, every decision, every motive to the light of Christ.</p>
<p>
(iii) The light exposes that which is evil. The best way to rid the world of any evil is to drag it into the light. So long as the thing is being done in secret, it goes on; but when it is taken into the light of day, it dies a natural death. The surest way to cleanse the depths of our own hearts and the practices of any society in which we happen to be involved is to expose them to the light of Christ.</p>
