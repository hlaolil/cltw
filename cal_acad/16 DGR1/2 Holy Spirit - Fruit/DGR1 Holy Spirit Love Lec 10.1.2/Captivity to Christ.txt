<h1>
Captivity to Christ
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
"For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God for pulling down strongholds, casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ," (2 Cor 10:3-5)</font></p>
<p>
Below we will use the acronym “DEMOLISH” as a way to remember not only how to win, but to remind us of what weapons are to be used in this battle for the mind.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Divine power</font></p>
<p>
We do not “wage war” as the world does. We have “divine power” to demolish strong holds. (2 Cor 10:4)
<p><font size="+1">
Evil forces</font></p>
<p>
For although we “live in the world” we do not wage war “as the world does.” A spiritual war requires “divine power.”  (2 Cor 10:3)
<p><font size="+1">
Mental war</font></p>
<p>
This is a mental war as the mind is the battlefield. By taking “every thought captive,” we win this war for the mind. (2 Cor 10:5)
<p><font size="+1">
Obliterate</font></p>
<p>
Jesus Christ is the “divine power” we have to obliterate the assault on our minds by taking “every thought captive” and making it “obedient to Christ.” (2 Cor 10:5)
<p><font size="+1">
Lies</font></p>
<p>
We should not live according to the “arguments” that are set up “against the knowledge of God” or believe the lies that we cannot be victorious in Jesus Christ. (2 Cor 10:5)
<p><font size="+1">
Internal war</font></p>
<p>This internal war causes turmoil if we are not taking captive “every thought.”  (2 Cor 10:5)
<p><font size="+1">
Strongholds</font></p>
<p>
We can either win the battle for the mind, or be taken captive as a P.O.W.! If we do not take our “thoughts captive,” they will take us captive and create a stronghold in our thoughts. (2 Cor 10:4)
<p><font size="+1">
Holy living</font></p>
<p>
This Scripture is a model how to win the battle for the mind using “divine power” to demolish strongholds, “divine power” to demolish arguments, “divine power” to demolish pretensions set up against the knowledge of God, how to take “thoughts captive” and make them “obedient to Christ.” All of which leads us into holy living before a holy God.  (2 Cor 10:3-5)</p>
<p>
For though we live in the world, we do not wage war as the world does. (2 Cor 10:3)</p>
