Become Aware of Your Thoughts
</h1>
<h3>
Our Brains
</h3>
<p>
The fact is, our own brains have their "fallen nature", and the false training they had received prior to becoming saved Christians. There are also the effects of the media, news, propaganda (movies, TV, radio, music, etc) and constant seeds being spat at Christians to attack their faith.</p>
<p>
What we are exposed to can create "pathways" in the brain, that can light up suddenly when a nerve signal fires through it. This can bring up evil we have been exposed to, in a sort of thought form. These thoughts can even mix with our daily life: seeming as if new thoughts, rather than what they actually are: traumatised memories.</p>
<p>
There are countless chemicals in our environment (such as perfume, fragranced laundry products, etc) that are messing with peoples ability to process thoughts properly. There are also evil spirits, enemies, and what the Bible calls "seducing spirits", trying to seduce people into sin and lies. Regardless of which is trying to cause influence, the fact is that no matter how strong and good of a Christian someone becomes, thoughts will come into their mind. These thoughts need to be kept in check. The brain is a wonderful tool for processing information, but it needs to be monitored and kept under control. Keeping our thoughts in check is one of the many differences between saved Christians and the rest of the world.</p>
<h3>
Parables
</h3>
<p>
(Examples) for understanding 2 Cor 10:5 ...</p>
<p><font size="+1">
1. Two people suddenly have blasphemous thoughts</font></p><p>
These thoughts come into their head against Jesus Christ.</p>
<p> 
The saved Christian renounces the thought (rejects it), recognising that it is not the truth, and not part of who he is as a Christian, and reassures (perhaps even proclaims out loud) the truth instead, that Jesus Christ is God and his Lord and Saviour. He has taken his thought in obedience to Christ.<br> 
The other person however, is deceived by the enemy into thinking that this blasphemous thought is what they must truly think about Jesus Christ (thinking: after all it's in their head), thus they have accepted it and it will work to destroy them.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
2. Two people suddenly have sexual lust thoughts</font></p><p>
These thoughts in their head are clearly proclaimed as damnable sin in the Bible.</p>
<p>The saved Christian renounces the thought (rejects it), recognising that it is not acceptable, and not part of who he is as a Christian, and reassures (perhaps even proclaims out loud) the truth instead, that Jesus Christ / God has designed him in truth, and given him the truth about what is and isn't acceptable in His eyes sexually.<br>
The other person however, is deceived by the enemy into thinking that this sexual lust thought in his head must be who he is as a person sexually (thinking: after all it's in his head), thus he has accepted it and it will work to destroy him.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
3. Two people are tempted to steal.</font></p><p>
The saved Christian renounces the temptation / thought (rejects it), recognising that it is not the truth, and not part of who he is as a Christian, and reassures (perhaps even proclaims out loud) the truth instead, that he is not a thief, and God has condemned theft.<br>
The other person gives in to the temptation, steals, and becomes a thief.</p>
<h3>
God / Jesus Know Your Thoughts
</h3>
<p>
God Almighty knows your very thoughts. It's not simply your actions that He will take into account. He needs to know that you reject evil thinking, and do not accept nor act upon it!</p>
<p>
"But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, <font color= "blue">"Why do you think evil in your hearts?" (Matt 9:4)</font>.</p>

"For I know their works and their thoughts. It shall be that I will gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come and see My glory." (Isa 66:18)</font>.</p>
