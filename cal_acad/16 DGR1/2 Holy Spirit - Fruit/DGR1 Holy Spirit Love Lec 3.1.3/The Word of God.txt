The Word of God
</h1>
<p>
In the Word of God, in the Holy Bible, Jesus has given us so much. He says: <font color= "blue">"These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full." (John 15:11)</font>. He wants us to have joy! He wants us to be full of faith and peace! Are we?</p>
<p>
Christians all around the world are suffering trials, tribulation and torment. We suffer constant sexual wickedness temptations (seducing spirits, abominations, Jezebels all over the place). We suffer chemical warfare (pollution, cleaning products, toxic fragrances, laundry products, dryer sheets, perfumes) that are destroying peoples health. We suffer persecution (attacks, lies, wickedness, segregation). We suffer dysfunction (in our families, friendships, relationships, jobs) etc ... In other places, such as blatant anti-Christ countries, Christians are suffering things even worse. The fact is, Christians are suffering! So what is this Joy Jesus is talking about?</p>
<h3>
Real Christians 
</h3>
<p>
(I'm talking about previous Godless sinners, who followed after their own lusts, wickedness and evil ...) Who then found Jesus Christ! When they truly got saved by Jesus, their lives changed. They repented of their sins, changed their ways, and left the darkness into the Light of God. They have gotten reproved, and trained by the Holy Spirit into living Godly lives. These Real Christians know what it means to have the Joy of Jesus Christ! The Joy of knowing that they are saved from eternal Hell and Damnation, saved from the rotting flesh worms who never quit, all because Jesus Christ took their sins to the Cross of Salvation, and paid for them with His death; on their behalf! This joy does not go away. This joy remains for eternity.</p>
<p>
No matter what a true Christian is facing. No matter what trials, tribulations, persecutions and torments, they still have that Joy, that Jesus Christ has saved them, and that they are going to Heaven. And as Jesus says: "these things I have spoken unto you" - He has taught us the Truth about God! He has taught us what is right and what is wrong! He has taught us how to live our lives! He has paved the way to God, and that brings true Christians Joy!</p>
<p>
If you are a Christian, I encourage you today to take some time off of focusing on your problems, and the problems of the people around you, and those you love. Take some time to think about what Jesus Christ has done for you, giving you a eternal seat in Heaven! Think about, and thank Him for all the miracles, healing, help, gifts, miracles that He has given to you (even things you do not know about). Thank Him for this, and allow it to be as Joy in your heart.</p>
