<h1>
Watch What You Hear
</h1>
<p>
If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear." Then He said to them, "Take heed what you hear. With the same measure you use, it will be measured to you; and to you who hear, more will be given.Mark 4:23- 24
If you get the Word in your hearts, you can get anything you need. If you spend enough time in the Word, it will change everything you do.
Jesus said, "If any man has ears to hear, let him hear", so as to perceive and comprehend. And He said to them, be careful what you are hearing. The measure of thought and study you give to the truth you hear will be the measure of virtue and knowledge that comes back to you, and more. We measure to ourselves the blessing of the Lord by the attention, respect and heed we give to His Word. If you give just a little heed to God's Word, that is all you are going to receive. If you give total heed and attention to God's Word, the power that comes back to you will be great and it will produce results in your life.</p>

Jesus said to be careful how you hear. Don't hear through tradition. Don't make the Word of God sift its way through traditional ears. It won't work for you. Receive God's Word willingly. Allow the Word to be unhindered by anything you have ever known or experienced.
To prosper in the faith walk, you must first make a decision that God's Word does not fail. If the Word of God does not seem to be working for you, it is not God's fault. There is something you don't know. More than likely, you are just not standing firm. The Bible says, "... and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore ..." (Eph 6:13-14). It says, "Stand." That's all. It doesn't say how long. If you catch yourself saying, "Well, the Word is not working for me," then you can know automatically that you are not standing. You must have a steadfast faith when it comes to God's Word. If it is not steadfast, it is not faith. One thing you must know is God's Word does not Fail!
