What Hearing Means
</h1>
<h3>
Decisions
</h3>
<p>
Life is full of decisions we must make that do not have absolute, specific-by-name, how-to directions in the Bible. How many hours a day should my kids watch TV? Is it okay to play shoot-up video games? Am I allowed to go on a date with a co-worker? Does God get mad if I miss work because I stayed up too late the night before? We all have notions about the truth, but how do we know for sure that these ideas are coming from a Divine Source? Sometimes distinguishing our own ideas from God’s leading is difficult. And what if our urges are actually coming from the enemy of our souls and not from God? How do we “take every thought captive” (2 Cor 10:5) when we aren’t sure where the thoughts are coming from?</p>
<p>
The most common ways God communicates are through the Bible and the leading of the Holy Spirit. Also, God can use a godly mentor to provide wise counsel (Prov 12:15). If God wants to speak to us, nothing can stop Him.</p>
<h3>
Pray
</h3>
<p>
If we are confused about whose voice we are hearing, it is good to pray for wisdom (James 1:5). We should ask God to clearly make His will known to us. When we pray, we “must believe and not doubt, because the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea, blown and tossed by the wind” (James 1:6). If we have no faith, we “should not expect to receive anything from the Lord” (James 1:7).

Talk to God in prayer and earnestly wait for His response. However, keep in mind that sometimes He doesn’t give us all the answers we desire. He knows what we need to know at any given time, and He will tell us if it is best.
<h3>
Study the Word
</h3>
<p>
Reading the Bible is the primary way God speaks to us. It is also the best way to learn about God’s character and His dealings with people throughout history. All Scripture is “breathed out by God” and is the guide for a righteous life (2 Timothy 3:16). While we speak to God in prayer, He speaks to us through His Word. As we read, we must consider the words to be the very words of God.</p>
<h3>
Listen to the Holy Spirit's Voice
</h3>
<p>
The Holy Spirit is God—a divine Being with a mind, emotions, and will. He is always with us (Psa 139:7–8). His purposes include interceding for us (Rom 8:26–27) and making decisions to benefit the church (1 Cor 12:7–11).</p>
<p>
When we feel that we have received personal instruction from God, we need to remain wise (Prov 4:7). We must “test the spirits” (1 John 4:1). The world is full of noise and distractions, and so are our minds. Life on earth is a spiritual battle. The enemy is eager to supply diversions to distract us from God’s will (1 Peter 5:8). We must be vigilant to ensure that what we have heard is more than a feeling but is truly from God Himself.
Remember, God wants to show us the right path to take. He’s not in the business of hiding His will from those who seek Him.</p>
<h3>
Question the Promptings
</h3>
<p>
Here are some good questions to ask as we examine whether or not promptings are from the Lord: Are the promptings confusing or vague? God is not the author of confusion; He is the bringer of peace (1 Cor 14:33). Do they go against God’s Word? God will not contradict Himself. Will following these promptings lead to sin? Those who live by the Spirit will not gratify the desires of the sinful nature (Gal 5:16).
In addition, you may want to seek counsel from a Christian friend, family member, or pastor (Prov 15:22). </p>
<h3>
Heeding the Right Voice
</h3>
<p>
God does not want us to fail. The more we listen to God, the better able we will be at distinguishing His voice from the other noises in our heads. Jesus, the Good Shepherd, gives His promise: “He goes on ahead of them, and his sheep follow him because they know his voice” (John 10:4). Others may speak, “but the sheep [do] not listen to them” (John 10:8). The better we know our Shepherd, the less we have to worry about heeding the wrong voice.</p>
