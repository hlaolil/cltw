“Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life” (Gal 6:7-8)</font>.</p>
<h3>
Sowing and Reaping
</h3>
<p>
I’ve always interpreted this in very black and white terms. If you sow sin of course that is what you will reap in life. However, the most destructive lies come at you in very non-threatening forms. Many believers are reaping what they’ve been sowing in the flesh under the disguise of ministry and good things; and what they are reaping is exhaustion, burnout and ineffectiveness because the good they’ve been doing hasn’t originated from source of the One who is good. Unknowingly, many of these things are done out of the flesh.</p>
<p>
Do not be deceived. We must protect the foundation of our beliefs. It is Christ in you that makes you good and right and enables you to live a good and holy life. Most start this way. I did. I imagine even the self-righteous Pharisee began in this way, but somewhere along the way, it is easy to buy into the lie that in ourselves we can do something for God and yet Paul says, <font color= "blue">“And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may have an abundance for every good work” (2 Cor 9:8)</font>. God as the source of goodness is the only way for you to abound in every good work.</p>
<h3>
Seek First His Kingdom and His Righteousness
</h3>
<p>
Jesus said to <font color= "blue">“But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you” (Matt 6:33)</font>. If you seek to live by your righteousness, trying to be like God without God, then what you will have in life is exactly that, a life that might look good on the outside but inside there is a void. However, if you seek God and the righteousness that exists because he is God and He is good, then what you will have is unlimited, unrestrained resources to do the things He has called you to do. It will be born of Him, it will flow out of you because of Him and it will be <font color= "blue">“given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over ...” (Luke 6:38a)</font>.</p>
