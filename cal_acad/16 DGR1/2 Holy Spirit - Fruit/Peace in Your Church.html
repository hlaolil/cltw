   <h1>
Peace in Your Church
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
"The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, ... Therefore let us pursue the things which make for peace and the things by which one may edify another." <br>(Gal 5:22, Rom 14:19)</font>.</p>
<h3>
Abusing God's Gifts
</h3>
<p>
Every gift of God, however excellent, is subject to abuse through the subtlety and malice of Satan. Christ's coming, for example, was to set the prisoner free from the bondage of inward sin and the bondage of outward religious ritual and ceremonial. But in New Testament times, through the cunning of Satan, some people stumbled at this liberty and could not accept it.</p>
<p>
Some were false brethren who stubbornly taught against it. Others were weak brethren who just could not see the point. The apostle Paul wanted to ensure that no antagonism developed between firm believers and those who were weaker brethren, so he laid down some rules to show believers when they should stand absolutely firm on a point, or when, instead, they should put the peace of the church first.</p>
<h3>
Three rules
</h3>
<p><font size="+1">
Rule (1) </font></p>
<p>
Bear in mind the weaker members. The doctrine of Christian liberty must give place to love for them. I must rather restrain myself than alarm and spiritually upset my brother. (Rom 14:13-15).
<p><font size="+1">
Rule (2)</font></p>
<p>
Bear in mind the doctrines of the Gospel. Often truths which should be strongly upheld when attacked by hardened critics, should be much more carefully handled when taught to true believers who are just uninstructed or confused when it comes to deeper things. (Rom 14:16-20)
<p><font size="+1">
Rule (3)</font></p>
<p>
Bear in mind the Church of God. Peace and edification are far more important than the rigorous asserting of our private understanding because the building up of the church is God's work and we have no right to spoil it with an unwise intrusion of some less important matter. To avoid disturbance men ought to suppress their opinions in less important matters and enjoy together the precious things they have in common (Rom 14:21-22).</p>
<p>
As certainly as Christ is described in the Scripture as a Captain, a Leader, a Man of War, and the Lion of the tribe of Judah, so He is also called the Prince of Peace.<br> Honoured at birth with the name Emmanuel' (a name of peace), He came into the world with the angels singing a song of peace, and was crowned in baptism with a love (the emblem of peace).<br> When He went out of the world He left His peace with His disciples as a legacy.</p>
<h3>
Contrast
</h3>
<p>
Under what circumstances then, should the church be a place of battle, and when should it be a place of peace? When should the Christian be contending, fighting, and when should he be forbearing - seeking peace?</p>
<p>
The apostle Paul teaches us both to withstand the obstinate, and have compassion for the weak. Out of firmness to some he refused to circumcise Titus (Gal 2:3); yet out of gentleness to others he circumcised Timothy (Acts 16:3). He was rock-like with some (Gal 1:10, 1 Thess 2:4), and yet anxious to give no offence to others (1 Cor 10:23).</p>
<p>
Our Saviour drew a sharp distinction in importance between some spiritual duties and others when He distinguished between the tithing of mint and cumin and a spiritual concern for judgement, mercy and faith. (Matt 23:23).</p>
<h3>
Distinctions
</h3>
<p>
The apostles also drew a distinction between things which were essential to faith, and things which were not essential. Paul distinguishes between meats and drinks and the Kingdom of God. He distinguishes between the foundation of the Gospel, and the superstructure (1 Cor 3:10-11).</p>
<p>
Some truths are the basic and essential gateway to the Kingdom of God, while others are understood with experience of God.<br>

Now this rule is certain: that where the major things of the Gospel are concerned (which are foundation truths, or obviously right next to them) we must<font color= "blue"> Contend Earnestly for the Faith (Jude 1:3)</font>. This was why Paul and Barnabas contended and disputed vigorously with false brethren who taught that certain ceremonies were essential for true faith, when they were not.</p>
<h3>
Preserving Peace
</h3>
<p>
How can peace be preserved amongst Christians?</p>
<p><font size="+1">
(1) Firstly</font></p>
<p>
Let us first remember that knowledge is apt to give birth to pride, and pride is always the mother of contention (1 Cor 12-13; Prov 13:10). It is a very hard thing for an intelligent man to be restrained and humble in the exercise of his gifts. Satan has often used the greatest brains for sowing errors in the church. So my first rule is this: correct and keep knowledge in its rightful place which is alongside your experience of the Way.<br> You are not to look on others as dull, but remember what is lacking in you and be made loving and peaceable.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
(2) Secondly</font></p>
<p> 
Peace is preserved by moderating the heat and fervour of your zeal against those who do not agree with you. It is the nature of many men to have such a reactive spirit that they too readily burst into temper.</p>
<p>
It was zeal in the women which persecuted Paul (Acts 13:50), and it was zeal in Paul which persecuted the church (Acts 26:9). Some men with bad characters have a tepid disposition which makes them harmless. Others have fervent devotion, but if it is not ruled by knowledge and maturity it is the most dangerous. <br>Zeal too often stretches the truth too far. An over-vehement dislike of error on the one side might cause the zealous man to run to the other extreme, so zeal must be ruled. Zeal also, frequently drags into the dispute irrelevant and false accusations so that reasoned argument becomes a debased squabble.
<p><font size="+1">
(3) Thirdly</font></p>
<p> 
Peace is preserved by Christians staying within their spiritual calling and not involving themselves with things for which they are not fitted. <br>Stay <font color= "blue">"within the limits of the sphere which God appointed us--a sphere which especially includes you". (2 Cor 10:13)</font>.<br>
<font color= "blue">
"Are all apostles?"..."are all teachers? ..." (1 Cor 12:29)</font> asks Paul, Has not God accorded to every man his measure? <br>Let us therefore be content with the apostle's rule,<br> <font color= "blue">"Brethren, let each one remain with God in that state in which he was called." <br>(1 Cor 7:24)</font>.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
(4) Fourthly </font></p>
<p> 
We must ensure that we have a brotherly mildness towards anyone we may feel is in the wrong. Acrimony and sharp rebuke is sometimes necessary where men of obstinate and pernicious mind are concerned (Titus 1:13; Gal 2:5), but amongst brethren, those who are not impossible to deal with, there ought to be meekness (Gal 6:1, 5:13; 2 Tim 2:25).</p>
<p>
So if there is sound agreement on the fundamental truths of the Gospel, we ought to put aside our disputes about matters which are only interesting and speculative, and which have no direct effect on faith and godly living.<br> Why spend precious hours in irrelevant argument to score a small point and at the same time shipwreck a great deal of love? Let it never be said of any of us that while we wrangled about scholastic notions, poor souls sinking under the tempest of sin and death were crying out, "Come and help us!"
