   <h1>
Goodness is like Hot Coals
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Beloved, do not avenge yourselves, but rather give place to wrath; for it is written, "Vengeance is Mine, I will repay," says the Lord. Therefore "If your enemy is hungry, feed him; If he is thirsty, give him a drink; For in so doing you will heap coals of fire on his head." (Rom 12:19-20)</font></p>
<p>
An amazing thing happens when you internalise a passage of scripture such as this and start living it out. Once you show consideration for people who disregard you, then enemies can no longer stay enemies. By caring for them, God's love spills out of your heart, becomes an action and people respond to it.</p>
<p>
God's love showed action when He sent Jesus into a hostile world.<br> Rom 5:8 tells us that while we are still steeped in sin, God demonstrated His love for us in the person of Jesus Christ. It is amazing to think that this act of mercy brought us into fellowship with God. It goes on to say: <br><font color= "blue">"For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life." (Rom 5:10)</font>. <br>His act of love brought us to the place where we were no longer enemies. <br>His mercy and goodness was never deserved, but Christ's purpose was to overcome evil and offer us freedom from death.</p>
<p>
In the same way, our actions should resemble this act of love and mercy. <br>Paul is quoting from an Old Testament passage when he reminds us to love our enemies by caring for them when they are in need. (Prov 25:21-22) <br>But Jesus told the disciples something very similar,<br> <font color= "blue">"But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you," (Matt 5:44)</font>. <br>And again in the Gospel of Luke, <font color= "blue">"Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, and pray for those who spitefully use you. To him who strikes you on the one cheek, offer the other also. And from him who takes away your cloak, do not withhold your tunic either. Give to everyone who asks of you. And from him who takes away your goods do not ask them back. And just as you want men to do to you, you also do to them likewise." <br>(Luke 6:27-31)</font>.<br>This attitude shows the genuineness of your faith. Jesus' point is that even sinners love and care for those who love them. But in the same way that He came and rescued His enemies making  us sons and daughters, we should love and care for those who hate us. In doing this we are not only allowing room for God to judge and make right in the end, but we are extending the love and mercy of God to our fellow mankind.<br><font color= "blue">"Or do you despise the riches of His goodness, forbearance, and longsuffering, not knowing that the goodness of God leads you to repentance? (Rom 2:4)</font>. <br>By showing His goodness, love and grace to one another we are opening the door for them to come to God and be fully justified before Him.</p>
<p>
Today, I pray that you understand this amazing truth from God's word.<br> May this revelation of God's mercy toward you extend to those around you and bless them. May God's love flow freely through you as you love and care for your enemies in His name.</p>
