   <h1> 
Maturing in Love
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
If we love one another, God abides in us, and His love has been perfected in us. (1 John 4:12)</font></p>
<p>
As we move to action, and obedience to Gods word, and focus on it, as we love others as He says to do, we will receive greater and greater blessings and comprehend what His love is. We will see how it works in us to others and gain the depth of the walk of love that He intends.</p>
<h3>
Experience Love
</h3>
<p>
Experience brings hope the word says, and we only get experience by our actions.<br>

Jesus, at the cross, broke down every social wall that could ever stop us from loving one another and Him. Only our disobedience or lack of action in love can make Christians appear to be and function like the world. He has given every tool, everything we need so we can be completely victorious. Love brings us out of this world, to a new level of living that will make us stand out to the world and attract them to Christ.</p>
<p> 
Adam lost for us the vision of the spiritual dimension, but Christ bought it back, but we must claim it and attain to it. It is this distortion that can keep us from seeing the Fathers full love, especially in the midst of pain, when the enemy comes to slander God to us. We can't listen, or let him blur the image of a loving heavenly Father.</p>
<h3>
Faith in God's Word
</h3>
<p>
We must be moved by the word of God instead of our senses.<br> Jesus did not allow Satan to trap Him in the sense realm, He stayed in the faith realm, and He consistently walked in love and beat the devil. <br>
Self and selfishness is the foundation of fear; it will always come up lacking.<br> His love is the foundation of faith and soundness to our minds. Fear says what will happen to me? Love says my Lord loves me and will surely take care of me, its in His word, written in His blood, and He will bless me. We partake of His perfect love by faith, and experience His abundant provision based on it.</p>
<p>
This scripture does not come alive in us, unless we attain to it, and believe for it. His perfect love does us no good if we simply read about it, or vaguely perceive it floating in the air, or wait to claim it when we die. God wants us to have it now, to reach its fullness in us now. It must live inside us powerfully every day, take root and grow until we have a total trust in Him. This is kingdom living, this is His idea, and it works perfectly. <br>
It will give us all the fruit in our lives that make us holy and calm and that comes from the dependence and trust we have in our Father in heaven.</p>
