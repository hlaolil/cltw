Examples of Longsuffering
</h1>
<p>
Longsuffering is a fruit of the Spirit: Galatians 5:22 lists it as number four on a list of 10!<br> Now, all of us yearn for the fruit of Love, joy, peace, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness and temperance, but who on earth wants to learn "longsuffering" or patient enduring? No, thank you!<br> And yet, God says longsuffering is a part of His character, a part of His image and a part of His nature. Therefore it's something He wants us all to learn.</p>
<p>
Paul tells us that he, himself, is a perfect pattern or model of Christ's longsuffering. He says that since Christ patiently endured his (Paul's) sinful ways, we must remember this example and patiently endure others' sinful ways.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"However, for this reason I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show all longsuffering, as a pattern to those who are going to believe on Him for everlasting life". (1 Tim 1:16)</font></p>
<p>
Longsuffering simply means "suffering that seems to last forever." <br>But please hear this: Longsuffering is always associated with hope and mercy. Therefore, it is the opposite of despair, discouragement and depression. <br><font color= "blue"> "remembering without ceasing your work of faith, labour of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of our God and Father," (1 Thess 1:3)</font> confirms this.</p>
<p>
Another definition of longsuffering that I really like is: believing all things, hoping all things and enduring all things. Longsuffering here describes someone who continually puts all unfulfilled hopes, dreams and visions at the foot of the Cross and never lets go, never gives in and never gives up!</p>
<p>
Longsuffering is simply Love that endures all circumstances. </p>
