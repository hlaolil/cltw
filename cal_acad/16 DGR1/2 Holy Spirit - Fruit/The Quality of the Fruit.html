   <h1>
The Quality of the Fruit
</h1>
<h3>
Glorifying the Father
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; so you will be My disciples" (John 15:8)</font>.<br>
Every disciple of Jesus who remains in Him, and allows His words to remain in them, will bear much fruit and will bring glory to the Father.</p>
<p>
We sing the chorus: "Father I love you, worship and adore you, glorify your name in all the earth ...". Our desire is that our Father in heaven is glorified on earth. But do we realise that if we, the disciples of Jesus Christ, bear much fruit in our lives, then our heavenly Father will be glorified?</p>
<p>
"To glorify" means to reveal someone as being great, important, or excellent.<br>If we allow Jesus to live His life in us, then our Father in heaven will be seen to be great, important, and excellent—in other words, He will be glorified in, and through, us. This is how we show the world, and the Father, that we are true disciples of our Lord.</p>
<h3>
Remain in His Love
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"As the Father loved Me, I also have loved you; abide in My love. If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love. These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full." (John 15:9–11)</font>.
Jesus said that as the Father had loved Him, so Jesus has loved us (past tense). He then said that if we obey His commands we will remain in His love (future tense), just as He obeyed His Father's commands and remained in His love.<br> The promise is conditional: remaining in Jesus' love depends upon us obeying His commands.</p>
<p>
Some Christians believe that Jesus will always love them no matter how they live or what they do. That is not what the Bible teaches. Jesus said that He remained in His Father's love specifically because He obeyed His Father's commands. That means that if He hadn't obeyed His Father's commands He would not have remained in His love.</p>
<p>
The words of our Lord must be studied carefully so that we do not deceive ourselves.
Jesus loved us before we were saved; He loved us so much He came to die for us. But now that we know Him, His continued love for us depends upon our obedience to Him. What was true for Jesus in His relationship with His Father, is also true for us in our relationship with Christ.</p>
<p>
Jesus said that <font color= "blue">"If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word;"  (John 14:23)</font>, which means that we prove our love for Jesus by obeying His Word.<br> 
<font color= "blue">"He who has My commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves Me. And he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him" (John 14:21)</font>. Again, Their love for us will depend upon our obedience.</p>
<p>
The Lord has told us these things so that His joy may be in us and our joy may be complete (John 15:11). Jesus wants us to have His joy. That joy comes from the love of Christ that is poured into our hearts when we walk in obedience to Him and His Word. There can be no substitute for such love and joy in our lives.</p>
<h3>
Fruit that will Last
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you that you should go and bear fruit,and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in My name He may give you. These things I command you, that you love one another." (John 15:16–17)</font>.<br>
Jesus has chosen and appointed us to go and bear fruit for the Father—fruit that will last. The fruit we will bear as Christ's life flows through us will remain, it will endure, it will last, it will be permanent, because it has been produced by God.</p>
<h3>
True fruit
</h3>
<p>
And now we come to the final point—the meaning of the word 'fruit' which is used so often in this passage.</p>
<p>
When I was a young Christian I believed that the Parable of the Sower was about bringing people to Jesus: some bring thirty, some sixty, and some a hundred people to the Lord. They reproduce themselves spiritually and that, <br>I thought, was 'bearing fruit' for the Father.<br>
But if the measure of our fruitfulness, in God's sight, is based upon the number of people we lead to Jesus then I, for one, have not been very fruitful in my life. I certainly haven't brought thirty, sixty, or a hundred people to the Lord (not knowingly anyway), and I don't suppose many other Christians have either.</p>
<p>
To understand the biblical meaning of the word 'fruit' we need to look at how it is used elsewhere in the New Testament, and one of the most important uses of the word is found in Gal 5.<br>
<font color= "blue">"Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.<br>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law." <br>(Gal 5:19–23)</font><br>
When we remember that we cannot bear fruit unless we remain in Jesus, and that Jesus remains (or dwells) in us by his Spirit, then the meaning of the word 'fruit', as used in John 15, becomes clear to us—it is the spiritual fruit produced in our lives by Christ's indwelling Spirit.</p>
<p>
To that list we can add <font color= "blue">"the the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ." (Phil 1:11)</font>,<br> 
<font color= "blue">"He who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous." <br>(1 John 3:7)</font>.<br> 
<font color= "blue">"the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to His name." (Heb 13:15)</font>
</p>
<h3>
Christian Maturity
</h3>
<p>
Luke's account of the Parable of the Sower says that the seed that fell among thorns stands for those who are choked by life's worries, riches, and pleasures and do not mature (Luke 8:14).<br>

The Greek word translated 'mature' means to bring to perfection or ripeness. Christian maturity, or 'coming to perfection', is not measured by how many people we bring to Jesus, but by the quality of the fruit we bear for God.</p>
<p>
Righteous living—living in obedience to God—together with love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control, is the fruit He wants us to bear for Him. Such fruit takes time to grow and to ripen in our lives and we can only produce that fruit as we allow Jesus Christ to live His life in us.</p>
