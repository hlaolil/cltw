The Three Steps
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
But also for this very reason, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, to virtue knowledge, to knowledge self-control, (2 Peter 1:5-6)</font></p>
<h3>
Faith, Virtue, Knowledge and Self Control
</h3>
<p><font size="+1">
The Foundation of Faith</font></p> 
<p>
A strong conviction and trust in both God and Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
The Quality of Virtue</font></p> 
<p>
A desire for excellence striving to become all that Jesus desires of us.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Increasing in Knowledge</font></p> 
<p>
Gaining awareness and understanding through study and experience especially regarding the will of God and the way of salvation.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Add Self Control as Knowledge Increases</font></p> 
<p>
What good is it to grow in knowledge of good and evil if we do not have the ability to make proper use of such knowledge?</p>
<h3>
A Closer Look at Self Control
</h3>
<p>
But what exactly is self-control, and how do we add it to our lives? <br>
Controlling the self is a natural component to growing in the knowledge of Jesus.<br>
As faith without works is dead, so faith without self control is meaningless.
Striving for excellence (virtue) is not possible without the discipline of self control.
Increasing in knowledge is nothing but an academic exercise, unless we are able to apply that knowledge by exercising self control.</p>
<p>
As we seek to develop self control in our lives remember the promise of our baptism (a new life free from sin's dominion!)<br>
Walk after the Spirit (by setting your mind on the things of the Spirit)<br>
Be empowered by the Spirit through the Word of God and prayer.</p>
<p>
Be careful to properly channel what self-control is developed and not follow human traditions, nor seek the praise of men but humbly pursue godliness, and serve our fellow man.</p>
<p>
In this way we develop that Christ-like character, coming to truly know
Him who through self-control offered Himself in service to His Father
and for sinners.</p>
