“He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him” (1 John 2:10)</font> </p>
<h3>
Loving your Brothers and Sisters
</h3>
<p>
This shows that there is a strong, inseparable relationship between “fellowship” and “loving the brethren.” Consequently, it appears that fellowship is intended to be the practice of loving the brethren, which helps keep us in a right relationship with Christ so that His shed blood can continue its full cleansing effect!</p>
<p>
Many passages of the Bible confirm that “love toward the brethren” is proof of our salvation.<font color= "blue"> “We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love his brother abides in death.” (1 John 3:14)</font>. In essence, we need brethren to have a right relationship with God. We are able to see our relationship with God from the reflection of our relationship with our brothers and sisters in Christ. <font color= "blue">“... for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen?” (1 John 4:20)</font></p>
<h3>
Fellowship
</h3>
<p>
Fellowship with the brethren is an exercise of love bringing us toward spiritual maturity. Your relationship with the brethren is the thermometer that measures your spiritual temperature. Your degree of love toward the brethren is the gauge that shows our love for God. <font color= "blue">“... If we love one another, God abides in us, and His love has been perfected in us” (1 John 4:12)</font>.</p>
<p>
Fellowship with the body of Christ is where love is tested and proven. It is the opportunity to learn how to love one another — it is God’s great classroom of the development of Christian character. We are benefited by both, the strengths and weaknesses of the fellowship. The mature ones help to strengthen and encourage us, while the weaknesses in the less mature give us the opportunity to practice — to test our spiritual growth in such characteristics as patience, long-suffering, gentleness, meekness, etc. (All spiritual virtues must be challenged and tested to bring forth progress.)</p>
<p>
At some time you may meet a few rude, offensive, immature believers in the body. They need someone like you to show them love and patience (so they’ll grow up), and you need them in order to practice and develop your love for the brethren. When you can remain loving and steadfast, even if brothers say negative things about you, let you down, or do offensive things, your love is being perfected — you’re growing up as a Christian and becoming more like Christ!</p>
<h3>
Rejecting Fellowship Leads Away from God
</h3>
<p>
How much love do you have for your brethren? The Bible says that we’re supposed to be ready to lay down our life for our brothers. But do you suppose you would really lay down your life for them if you’re not willing to even come together with them a few times a week for worship?  <font color= "blue">“By this we know love, because He laid down His life for us. And we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren” (1 John 3:16)</font>.</p>
<p>
Jesus expressed that we must be committed to the love of the brethren in the same way that He was. He stated that this love toward the brethren was the necessary evidence to prove our authenticity as Christians to the world.  <font color= "blue">“A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another. “By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another” (John 13:34-35)</font>.</p>
