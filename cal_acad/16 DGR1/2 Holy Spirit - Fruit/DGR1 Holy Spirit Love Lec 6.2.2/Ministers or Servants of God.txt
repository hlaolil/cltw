Ministers/Servants of God

Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and was going to God, rose from supper and laid aside His garments, took a towel and girded Himself. After that, He poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which He was girded.
(John 13:3-5)</font></p> 
<h3>
Real Servants Base Their Identity in Christ
</h3>
<p>
They remember they are unconditionally loved and accepted by grace, so they don't have to prove their worth when they are threatened by lowly jobs. Most of us are too insecure to be servants. Were afraid our weaknesses and insecurities will be uncovered so we hide them with layers of protective pride and pretensions.</p>
<p>
One of the most profound examples of serving from a secure self-image is Jesus washing the feet of his disciples. Washing feet was the equivalent of being a shoe-shine boy, a job devoid of status. But Jesus knew who He was, so it didn't threaten or bother Him to do it.</p>
<p>
The Bible says Jesus knew that the Father had put all things under His power, and that He had come from God...so He got up from the meal, took off His outer clothing, and wrapped a towel around His waist ...</p>
<p>
If you're going to be a servant you must settle your identity in Christ. Only secure people can serve. The more insecure you are, the more you'll want people to serve you, and the more you'll need their approval. On the other hand, when you base your worth and identity on your relationship to Christ, you are freed from the expectation of others. You are freed to serve.</p>
<p>
Servants don't need to cover their walls with plaques and awards to validate their work. They don't insist on being addressed by titles and they don't wrap themselves in robes of superiority. Servants find status symbols unnecessary and they never measure their worth by their achievements. Paul said, You may brag about yourself, but the only approval that counts is the Lord's approval.</p>
<p>
If anyone had the chance of a lifetime to flaunt his connections and "name-drop," it was James, the half-brother of Jesus. He had the credentials of growing up with Jesus as his brother. Yet in introducing his letter, he simply referred to himself as "a servant of God and the Lord Jesus." The closer you get to Jesus, the less you need to promote yourself.</p>
<h3>
Being a Minister/Servant
</h3>
<p>
Real Servants Think of Ministry as an Opportunity, Not an Obligation<br>

They enjoy helping people, meeting needs, and doing ministry. They "serve the Lord with gladness." Why do we serve with gladness? Because we love the Lord, were grateful for his grace, we know serving is the highest use of life, and God has promised a reward. Jesus promised, The Father will honour and reward anyone who serves me. And Paul added, He will not forget how hard you have worked for him and how you have shown your love to him by caring for other Christians.</p>
<p>
Imagine what could happen if just 10% of all Christians in the world got serious.</p> about their role of being a real servant. Imagine all the good that could be done. Are you willing to be one of those people? Albert Schweitzer said, "The only really happy people are those have learned how to serve."</p>
