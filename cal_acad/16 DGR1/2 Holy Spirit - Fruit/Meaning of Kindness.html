Meaning of Kindness
</h1>
<h3>
The Motivation to Kindness
</h3>
<p>
In a world that is more prone to the tooth-and-claw philosophy of Darwin, than it is to the rule of kindness, one is bound to ask: <br>How is one to survive in a ruthless society wherein kindness is becoming such a rare commodity? Is there value in kindness? If so, how do we learn this virtue?</p>
<p>
It is an indisputable fact that every good trait of which man is capable, ultimately, is motivated by that which is found in the Creator — in whose image he has been fashioned (Gen 1:26-27). </p>
<p>
John writes:<br>
<font color= "blue">
“We love Him because He first loved us” (1 John 4:19).</font> <br>
So, similarly, Jesus declared:<font color= "blue"> “But love your enemies, do good, and lend, hoping for nothing in return; and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High. For He is kind to the unthankful and evil.” (Luke 6:35).</font></p>
<p>
How tragic it is that so many, even in the church, have never learned this truth. Rather, they contend that one’s enemies are worthy of destruction.<br> If we would emulate our God, we will cultivate kindness.</p>
<h3>
Heavenly Kindness
</h3>
<p>
In the antique religion of paganism, only rarely is the term “kind” used of the gods. The heathen disdained the term and “thought it to be incompatible with the majesty of deity”.</p>
<p>
By way of contrast, however, the God of the Bible is supremely kind.<br>

The Psalmist wrote:<font color= "blue"> “Praise the Lord! Oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good! For His mercy endures forever.” (Psa 106:1)</font>.</p>
<p>
Paul says that the gift of Christ for human salvation was an expression of divine <font color= "blue">“kindness” (Titus 3:4; Eph 2:7)</font>, and,<br> <font color= "blue">"the goodness of God leads you to repentance" (Rom 2:4)</font>.</p>
<p>
Paul also says,<font color= "blue"> "Therefore consider the goodness and severity of God: on those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, if you continue in His goodness. Otherwise you also will be cut off". (Rom 11:22)</font><br>
God’s goodness and kindness is set in contrast to his “severity.” The latter is derived from a word meaning “to cut off.” </p>
<p>
But note that whereas the Roman Christians were urged to consider the goodness or kindness of God, they were similarly admonished to “continue” in that kindness (Rom 11:22), which is the equivalent of continuing in “the faith” (cf. Acts 14:22). There is human responsibility there; those who neglect the Creator’s kindness, ultimately will suffer His wrath. Now is the time for accepting Heaven’s kindness; the day will come when only “judgement” remains.</p>
<p>
Since the varying qualities of deity are wonderfully apparent in Jesus, it should be no surprise that the milk of kindness was evidenced in the Son of God. <br>In that great invitation offered to the cities of Galilee, and in spite of their rejection of His miraculous works (cf. Matt 11:20ff), Christ bade the citizens of His country to:
<font color= "blue">
“Come to Me, all you who labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light."” (Matt 11:28-30)</font>.</p>
<p>
In addition to His teaching, the Son of God also exemplified kindness in His demeanour toward others. His treatment of the woman who had been apprehended in the very act of adultery exuded the spirit of gentleness and compassion (cf. John 8:1ff), though the Saviour did not condone her evil in any way.</p>
<p>
Or consider how Jesus dealt with Judas when the traitor approached Him in the garden of Gethsemane, assaulting Him with a treacherous kiss. The Lord gently said: <font color= "blue">"Friend, why have you come?" (Matt 26:50)</font>. Kind to the very end.</p>
<h3>
New Testament Admonitions
</h3>
<p>
The New Testament documents have a good deal to say about the necessity of kindness. Paul observes that those who possess love (<i>agape</i>) are kind <br>(1 Cor 13:4); indeed, kindness is one of those qualities that compose the “fruit” of the Holy Spirit (Gal 5:22) — without which one does not belong to the Lord (Rom 8:9). It was a marvellous trait that was generously demonstrated by the Lord’s apostles (2 Cor 6:6).</p>
<h3>
Kindness Applied
</h3>
<p>
It is one thing to speak of kindness in the abstract, it is quite another to make specific applications. But this is what we must do. We must get down to “where we live.”<br>
Let us, therefore, look at several areas in which a greater measure of kindness doubtless is needed.</p>
<h3>
Kindness to strangers
</h3>
<p>
The Christian must look for opportunities to show kindness to others in society at large. That next-door neighbour, the waitress in the restaurant, the companion on the plane, etc. It appears that so many these days are “cocked,” ready to “take on” someone at the drop of a hat.</p>
<p>
The early saints earned the reputation of being so very kind to their contemporaries. The Roman ruler Julian, who reigned a brief period in the mid-fourth century A.D. and who despised Christianity, nonetheless unwittingly paid a glowing compliment to the primitive saints when he wrote:<br>

“As children are coaxed with cake, so have these Christians enticed the poor to join them by kindness. Strangers they have secured by hospitality. By affecting brotherly love, great moral purity, and honouring their dead, they have won the multitude”.</p>
<h3>
Kindness in the home
</h3>
<p>
There must be a greater exhibition of kindness in the home. <br>Sometimes husbands and wives are so brutal to one another. Words can cut deeply, and there are those who surgically use the tongue as a deadly instrument, wounding the soul.</p>
<p>
There are parents who talk to and treat their children no better than a common street dog. Most everyone is aware that child-abuse is virtually epidemic in its scope. Even now, there is the growing maltreatment of aged parents by cruel and ungrateful offspring.</p>
<p>
In the concluding chapter of the book of Proverbs, there is the recorded testimony of king Lemuel, as taught to him by his dear mother, regarding the woman who is to be deemed “worthy” <font color= "blue">Who can find a virtuous wife? For her worth is far above rubies.(Prov 31:10)</font>. </p>
<p>
Note the adulation she enjoys from her family.<font color= "blue"> "The heart of her husband safely trusts her; So he will have no lack of gain. She does him good and not evil all the days of her life".(Prov 31:11-12)<br></font>. 
<font color= "blue">Her children rise up and call her blessed; Her husband also, and he praises her: "Many daughters have done well, but you excel them all." (Prov 31: 28-29).</font> 
One of the key elements to the domain of domestic bliss surely has to be this: <font color= "blue">“on her tongue is the law of kindness” (Prov 31:26b)</font>.</p>
<p>
Is there any doubt about the fact that if more homes were saturated with the benevolence of kindness, there would be far fewer divorces, less juvenile delinquency, and a much greater degree of happiness?</p>
<h3>
Kindness in the church
</h3>
<p>
There needs to be a larger measure of kindness in the church.<br> Some of the early congregations apparently had their problems mastering this virtue. Paul dropped a load on the Ephesians when he wrote:<br>
<font color= "blue">
“Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamour, and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice. And be kind to one another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, just as God in Christ forgave you.” (Eph 4:31-32)</font>.</p>
<p>
It is interesting that the verb in this passage linked to the word “kind” literally means “to become,” and its present tense form would suggest, “practice becoming kind to one another.” This indicates that kindness is something that has to be diligently pursued and practised. It does not come easily when dealing with difficult people.</p>
<p>
How many church problems might be healed if brethren were kinder to each other? In some congregations, where elders do not exist, “business meetings” have become a virtual war zone for the display of all sorts of harshness. <br>Some brethren appear to be unable to approach an issue except in the “attack” mode.</p>
<p>
There are men who serve as shepherds (elders) who do not treat their flock with kindness. Have you ever noticed how many of the bishop’s qualifications relate to this quality — such traits as no brawler, no striker, not contentious, gentle, patient, given to hospitality, just, a lover of good men?</p>
<p>
Moreover, as virtually anyone who has his finger on the brotherhood pulse knows, there are preachers among us who find it most difficult to disagree with others without punctuating their diatribes with the worst sort of epithets.<br> To them, “kindness” is not a virtue; it is compromise and weakness.</p>
<p>
There are, of course, occasions when one is compelled to deal with error and its advocates in a forceful way. Jesus did (cf. Matt 23), and He was the epitome of kindness. Moreover, the inspired writers of the New Testament also addressed heresy and the purveyors thereof.</p>
<p.
There is, however, a difference between dealing with a false ideology or an erring brother, and that in a firm fashion, and being downright vicious. Some of our men have mastered the art of hatefulness.</p>
<p>
May we strive toward a kinder atmosphere in the various compartments of our lives.</p>
