   <h1>
The Importance of Self Control 
</h1>
<h3>
Paul’s Advice on Self Control
</h3>
<p>
Paul thought that self control was important and so he wrote a lot of advice about it. This can be seen in a letter he wrote to Titus. He stated that the elders must be self controlled.</p> 
<p><font color= "blue">
"... must be blameless, as a steward of God, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for money, but hospitable, a lover of what is good, sober-minded, just, holy, self controlled," (Titus 1:7-8)</font></p>
<h3>
The Older Men
</h3>   
<p>
He told Titus to teach self control to the older men:<br>
<font color= "blue">"that the older men be sober, reverent, temperate, sound in faith, in love, in patience;" (Titus 2:2) </font></p>
<h3>
The Older Women
</h3>
<p>
The older women were to teach self control to the younger women.<br>
<font color= "blue">
"the older women likewise, that they be reverent in behaviour, not slanderers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things— that they admonish the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, to be discreet, chaste, home makers, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be blasphemed". (Titus 2:3-5)</font></p> 
<h3>
The Young Men
</h3>
<p>
The young men were also encouraged to have self control. <br>
<font color= "blue">
"Likewise, exhort the young men to be sober-minded," (Titus 2:6)</font></p>
<p>
So from these writings of Paul we can see that everybody needs to learn to be self controlled. Paul made this such a big point because he knew that self control does not come naturally. </p>
<h3>
Self Control and Sin (Disobedience to God) 
</h3>
<p>
Self control is a challenge to everybody. Each person has some area in thought or action where they find self control difficult. However, if we don’t exercise self control then it can lead to sin (disobedience to God). </p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God. (1 Cor 6:9-10)</font></p>
<p>
All of these sins listed in these verses come about because of poor self control. </p>
<h3>
Praise of Self Control 
</h3>
<p>
Self-mastery is the greatest of all victories. <br>
<font color= "blue">
"He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty, and he who rules his spirit than he who takes a city". (Prov 16:32) </font></p> 
<p>
Men who have subdued entire kingdoms have been defeated in the efforts to control themselves! For example, lack of self control of a bad temper can be evidence of pride and impatience.<br> There are many examples of those who did control their temper such as:<br> David who stayed calm when he was cursed (2 Sam 16), and,<br> Nehemiah who also showed that he could control his spirit even when the enemy sneered at him and attempted to destroy him. (Neh 4)<br> However Samson (Judges 16) and Uzziah (2 Chron 26) are examples of people who could not control themselves.</p>
