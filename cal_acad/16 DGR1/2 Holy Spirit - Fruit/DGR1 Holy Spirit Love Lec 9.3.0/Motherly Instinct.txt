Motherly Instinct

But we were gentle among you, just as a nursing mother cherishes her own children. (1 Thess 2:7)</font></p>
<h3>
Christian Leadership is Gentle 
</h3>
<p>
"Gentle" describes a teacher who is patient in the nurturing process, or of a nursing mother with babies. It is also a botanical term which describes the care and feeding of a young plant so that it grows properly to maturity. You have to handle plants and babies delicately for they are fragile creatures which do not respond to harsh and rough treatment. They can be damaged so easily. </p>
<p>
The kingdom of God is a gentle environment of which the church is a manifestation. We need to be gentle with one another because we do not know what is going on in the lives of those around us. They may be vulnerable and fragile. We cannot assume that they are sturdy and strong. They may require delicate handling, a discernment of the Spirit, and tender care. The incidence of mental illness in our communities, the prevalence of autistic disorders and other manifestations of brain disease, necessitates us acquiring this fruit of the Spirit – gentleness.</p> 
<h3>
Christian Leadership is Loving 
</h3>
<p>
“We loved you so much ...” The love of God is communicated to us through loving our neighbour. If we say that God loves us then we will show it by loving one another. Love is translated into deeds. We care for one another. We pray for one another. We bear one another’s burdens.<font color= "blue"> “And above all things have fervent love for one another, for “love will cover a multitude of sins.” (1 Peter 4:8,10)</font> We love by serving one another because love is setting aside our prerogatives in order to meet the needs of others. Love is unselfish – there is no place for ego. Christian leadership is servant leadership, as Jesus demonstrated in washing the feet of the disciples.<font color= "blue">“Love suffers long and is kind; ...” (1 Cor 13:4-10)</font>. This leadership dynamic creates an organisation and community different from the competitive business world.</p>
<h3>
Christian Leadership Delights in Sharing the Gospel 
</h3>
<p>
The family of God is conceived and born through the sharing of the gospel of God. The church is not just a social organisation of high-minded people dedicated to good works, it has a mission to reach people with the gospel. We have a passion for communicating the good news of the coming of Christ, for witnessing to Jesus as the key to meaning and purpose in life, for making known the empowering gift of the Spirit, the Comforter, the promise of the Resurrection and the reality of eternal life. </p>
<p>
A mother wants only the best for her children. The best gift we can give anyone is the unsearchable riches of Christ. It is sharing the treasure hidden in a field, and the pearl of great price. The Christian leader is unashamed of the gospel for it is the power of salvation to all who believe. It is good news in a world filled with bad news. It is healing medicine of the soul. We are fearless in our communication of the gospel. The Christian may be gentle in manner but also resolute in action when it is a matter of life or death.</p>
<h3>
Christian Leadership is Personal 	
</h3>
<p>
“We were delighted to share with you ... our lives as well, because you had become so dear to us.” Christianity is not just an intellectual exercise in learning information, or the sharing of ideas. It has to do with relationships: a relationship with Jesus, the Son of God, and with one another as members of the family of God. We are not hypocrites, living behind masks, acting a part. We seek for authenticity in our relationships with each other. We admit our failings and our needs. We each are on a journey through life, a pilgrimage that has many pitfalls and challenges. None of us is perfect. None of us has arrived. But we share what we have learned and how we have grown in grace and the knowledge and love of God.</p>
<h3>
God’s Relationship with Us
</h3>
<p>
This maternal model of leadership is rooted in God’s relationship with us. <font color= "blue">“Can a woman forget her nursing child, and not have compassion on the son of her womb? Surely they may forget, yet I will not forget you. ... As one whom his mother comforts,so I will comfort you;” (Isa 49:15; 66:13)</font></p>
<p>
What a wonderful reassurance of the nature of the love of God as seen in the Gospel of Jesus.</p>
