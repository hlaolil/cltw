<h1>
Fully Matured Love
</h1>
<p>
John moves from right belief about Jesus (1 John 4:1-6) to right conduct toward one another (1 John 4:7-21). For the third time he commands us to love one another (cf., 1 John 2:7-11; 1 John 3:11-18). The word “love” occurs twenty-seven times in this passage. In between admonishments to love one another, John illustrates God’s love for us and encourages us that mature love brings a lasting hope in God’s promise of eternal life.</p>
<h3>
Love One Another 
</h3>
<p>
Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. He who does not love does not know God, for God is love. (1 John 4:7-8)
Since our nature derives from our Parent, John takes it for granted that we will be like our Father.
Throughout John’s writings, he makes simple statements that describe God’s nature: God is “God is true” (John 3:33); "God is Spirit,” (John 4:24); "God is light,” (1 John 1:5); “He is faithful and just” (1 John 1:9); “God is greater than our heart,” (1 John 3:20); “God is love” (1 John 4:8; 4:16). In essence, God is a non-material, personal, loving being who is morally perfect, honest, and fair in all his judgements as He pardons for the sake of establishing and maintaining a relationship with us. These features, to some extent, ring true for members of God’s family.</p>
<p>
To Consider: <br>
The excellencies of God’s love are beyond imagination!<br> 
God’s love is unconditional (Deut 7:6-8; John 15:12; 2 Tim 1:9),<br> 
unmerited (Hos 14:4; Rom 5:6, 8), <br>
incomprehensible (Psa 108:4; Eph 3:19); <br>
everlasting (Ex 15:13; Psa 119:76; 136; Isa 54:10; Jer 31:3; Lam 3:32),<br> 
tender and gentle (Psa 86:5; Isa 49:15; Hos 11:1, 3-4; Zeph 3:17), <br>
our highest goal in life (Psa 63:3; Prov 19:22).</p>
<h3>
God’s Love For Us
</h3>
 <p>
Since God is “love,” then what is love? When defining love, John thinks in terms of initiative and sacrifice. And, when thinking in terms of initiative and sacrifice, John thinks in terms of Jesus. Therefore, when defining love, John thinks in terms of Jesus.(John 9-16)
Yet, John did not tell us to love God in return. Instead, he insists that we love one another. Love desires to give, not get. Love sacrifices all, not some.
Love is God’s motivation behind the self-disclosure of Himself in Jesus (John 3:16). In expressing God’s salvific love, Jesus’ humility in His death, as well as His life, was involved. Authentic, biblical love for one another demands no less a sacrifice.</p>
<p>
In John’s community, some were concerned only about a vertical relationship with God at the expense of nurturing horizontal relationships with God’s family. Consequently, they were hateful and indifferent toward others. The goal of love, however, is practical. Love’s intended result is always realised (<font color= "blue">“that the world through Him might be saved.” (John 3:17) </font>). So too, when we express God’s love for others, the effects must be obvious .
God’s love is proactive, not reactive. Human love for God and others is the result of a direct encounter with the reality of God’s salvific love (also, John 19). All other forms of human love only hint at this reality. When believers love one another with the same love God had for us at the cross, the peak of perfect love has been reached.
<font color= "blue">No one has seen God at any time. (John 1:18)</font>, He can be perceived in the genuine expressions of love among His people.
If the source of love is God, then the inspiration to love is His Spirit. How it is that “we live in Him, and He in us” is by the Holy Spirit whom God has given us. By the very presence of God’s Spirit in our lives, we can have assurance of a relationship with God.</p>
<p>
The Spirit’s presence in us, a faithful witness to Jesus, and love for others are all evidences of being in God’s family (John 3:23-24).</p>
<p>
To Consider: <br>
For John, it is impossible to divorce the doctrinal test from the social test. To believe the right things about Jesus is to be transformed by God’s love, since Jesus is the full expression of the love of God.</p>
<h3>
Confidence in God’s Love (John 17-18)
</h3>
<p>
God’s “complete” love is better translated “mature” love. In John 2:5 mature love is realised by an obedient lifestyle. Here, mature love (John 4:12,17) is demonstrated by love for others.</p>
<p>
The result of walking in obedience and loving others is confidence on the day of judgement. Our future confidence is tied to our present reality of loving others and obedient living. For the Apostle John, boldness in the face of God’s judgement is grounded in obedience and love.</p>
<p>
Being “in this world” is no hindrance to our walk, because we are like Jesus whose life was the perfect expression of love and obedience. Being in the world is where victory is realised (cf., John 2:13-17; 5:4-5, 19).<br>
All fear is banished when the believer’s life reflects the mature, sacrificial love God has shown in the life of Jesus. Moreover, our love for God provides courage before him. Since love dispels fear just as light dispels darkness, it’s impossible to love and to fear God at the same time. The more we love God the more courage we have in his presence.</p>
<h3>
Love One Another (John 19-21)
</h3>
<p>
The ultimate ground or basis for our assurance is not found in our love for others, but in God’s love for us. Mature human love is always a response to divine love.  John implicitly states that we can love because God loved us, but also that we must love because God has loved us. <font color= "blue">"We love Him because He first loved us" (1 John 4:19)</font></p>
<p>
Yet, some in John’s community claimed to love God while hating others. John says it’s impossible to experience God’s love and not express it. Genuine, biblical love always manifests itself in and toward the loved. The requirements of love are never complete by loving God without also loving those born of God.<br>
To withhold love from others indicates that love for God is impossible (cf.,John 3:17). As his basis for authority John repeats the love command that Jesus gave (cf., Matt 12:28-34; John 15:12, 17; 13:34-35).</p>
<h3>
Summary
</h3>
<p>
If we love God, we will obey Him and, to obey God is to love others. In loving others as Christ loved us, we gain confidence that we belong to God’s family. Therefore, love is a compelling means of increasing assurance of salvation.</p>
