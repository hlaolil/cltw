Longsuffering Examples
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
However, for this reason I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show all longsuffering, as a pattern to those who are going to believe on Him for everlasting life. (1 Tim 1:16)</font> </p>
<p>
When we hear the word patience, we probably think of the virtue that enables us to wait. That’s one way of looking at it, but Spirit-led patience is also much more. Patience is longsuffering. It involves more than passive waiting; it is active forbearance. It is a deliberate willingness to put up with disagreeable things in pursuit of higher goals.</p>
<p>
The best example of patience in the Bible is God Himself. A number of times, God is described as being “slow to anger” (see Ex 34:6; Psa 103:8). <br>This phrase captures what true patience is. Patient people do more than just wait. They actively restrain their rightful anger and frustration.<br> For a higher purpose, they put up with things that they know are wrong.</p>
<p>
This is the attitude our longsuffering God has toward sinful people.<br> For Paul, the “immense patience” of Jesus meant that God put up with all his wickedness for a long time before showing mercy to him.<br> Paul calls himself “the worst of sinners,” reflecting back on the time of his life when he persecuted Christians (see Acts 7:54-8:3).<br> But God had other plans for Paul (Acts 9:1-31; 13:1-28:31).<br> That could easily be the testimony of every believer.</p>
<p>
How wonderful that God’s love rests on His own capacity for goodness, and not our own!</p>
