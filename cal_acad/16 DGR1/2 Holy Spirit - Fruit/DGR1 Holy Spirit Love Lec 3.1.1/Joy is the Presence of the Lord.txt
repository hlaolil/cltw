Joy is the Presence of the Lord

<h3>
Joy and natural Happiness are Never to be Confused
</h3>
<p>
Happiness is a state of pleasure or contentment usually resulting from positive circumstances.  It is a positive natural response to positive natural events or situations.  Or, at its best, it is the attitude that results from putting the best spin (interpretation) on otherwise difficult circumstances, a mindset popularised by the modern proponents of a positive mental attitude.  
Joy, on the other hand, is the fruit of the abiding presence of the Holy Spirit and is not governed by the changes in circumstances; in fact, it transcends them.</p>
<h3>
Joy is a choice.    
</h3>
<p>
The unbeliever, being devoid of the Spirit of God, knows nothing of joy.  But for the believer, who experiences the indwelling Presence of God, joy is the result of Christ within.  I am not suggesting that I am always joyful, nor do I imagine that such is the case with any other believer.  But a believer can and ought to experience the joy of the Lord even in His times of deepest distress (Paul described himself <font color= "blue">
“as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing” (2 Cor 6:10)</font> because joy is truly a choice.  We know this to be true for several reasons:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
(1) God commands us to be Joyful</font></p>
<p> <font color= "blue">
“Rejoice in the Lord always. Again I will say, rejoice!” (Phil 4:4).</font></p>  
<p><font color= "blue">
“Rejoice evermore” (1 Thess 5:16)</font>. </p> 
<p><font color= "blue">
“My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials,” (James 1:2)</font>.</p>
<p>
God never requires the impossible; that is to say that everything God requires of believers is impossible to fulfil in the flesh, but nothing is impossible by the power of God dwelling in the believer.  Believing His Word, yielding ourselves to Him, and obeying His will as revealed in the Word will produce “the joy of the Lord” in good times and bad.</p>

(2) God Himself is Joyful</font></p>
<p> <font color= "blue"> 
“The Lord your God in your midst, The Mighty One, will save; He will rejoice over you with gladness, He will quiet you with His love, He will rejoice over you with singing.” (Zeph 3:17). </p>
<p> <font color= "blue">
“You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; Therefore God, Your God, has anointed You With the oil of gladness more than Your companions.” (Heb 1:9)</font>.</p>
<p>  
As God is essentially a God of joy and delight, and believers receive His nature, joy is our heritage.  The text immediately above provides insight into how it becomes possible to live a joy-filled life:  love righteousness and hate iniquity (and, conversely, what crushes joy:  hatred of righteousness and love of iniquity).</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
(3) God intends His Joy to be Fulfilled in Believers.</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">
“You will show me the path of life; in Your presence is fullness of joy; at Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.” (Psa 16:11)</font>. </p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“But now I come to You, and these things I speak in the world, that they may have My joy fulfilled in themselves” (John 17:13)</font> .  
Ultimate joy will be the lot of the believer in the perfect presence of the Lord in eternity, but those who through faith and obedience live in fellowship with the Lord experience a wonderful fullness of the Lord’s joy even this side of eternity.</p>
<h3>
What is Joy
</h3>
<p>
How do we choose to be joyful?  We do not experience joy in the scriptural sense by some effort of our minds (PMA).  Joy is the fruit of the Holy Spirit.  How, then do we “choose” it?  It is not the product of wishing, hoping, nor even particularly of praying for joy.  Rather, joy is the (super)natural outflow of obedient abiding in Christ:<font color= "blue">
“If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father's commandments and abide in His love. These things I have spoken to you, that My joy may remain in you, and that your joy may be full.” (John 15:10-11)</font>.  Thus, we experience joy, not through a conscience choice to be joyful, but through a deliberate choice to believe God and to obey His Word.</p>
<p>
A reality check.  Joy is not a denial of reality, nor a overly optimistic view of life.  Joy is not the fruit of a life without burdens and trials, nor is it the absolute absence of grief, sorrow, and pain, but it is the personal experiencing of the character of the indwelling Christ in the life and the further assurance of His good and perfect purpose in all things.  We may have the testimony of Habakkuk:
<font color= "blue">
“Though the fig tree may not blossom, Nor fruit be on the vines; Though the labour of the olive may fail, And the fields yield no food; Though the flock may be cut off from the fold, And there be no herd in the stalls -- Yet I will rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my salvation.” (Hab 3:17-18)</font>.
Joy is a choice.</p>
