Maturity of Faith
</h1>
<p>
Paul tells us Abraham “grew strong in his faith” (Rom 4) and urges us to walk in Abraham’s footsteps. To believe like he believed. How do we do this?</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"who, contrary to hope, in hope believed, so that he became the father of many nations, according to what was spoken, "So shall your descendants be." <br>And not being weak in faith, he did not consider his own body, already dead (since he was about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah's womb. He did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God, and being fully convinced that what He had promised He was also able to perform".(Rom 4:18-21)</font></p>
<h3>
Look to God’s Promise not Your Circumstances
</h3>
<p>
Abraham?s situation looked bleak. God promised him multitudes of descendants,(Rom 4:18) but the only problem was he was well past child producing. “he did not consider his own body, already dead (since he was about a hundred years old).” He also considered the barrenness of Sarah’s womb. Not only was Abraham almost 100 years old, but Sarah his wife was very old and she had never been able to have children her whole life. How are they going to have children? If Abraham had based his hope on his circumstances he would have given up. But In hope he believed against hope – God?s promise gave him hope in his hopeless situation. He put his hope in God?s promise, not his circumstances.</p>
<p>
We may feel hopelessly unrighteous. We may feel like God could never forgive us for the sins we have committed, that He would never accept us.<br> But we must not look at ourselves, just like Abraham didn't look at himself, but like Abraham, we must believe God's promise of grace. <br>He counts me righteous in Christ!</p>
<p>
Our teenager may seem hopelessly lost. Our finances may be out of control.<br> We may lack direction for our lives. Our marriage might be frustrating or our church might be a mess. Look to Jesus Christ! Don't look to yourself.<br> Look to the promise of the gospel – everyone who believes in Him shall be saved. Look to His promises to draw near to those who draw near to Him. Promises to hear and answer our prayers.</p>
<h3>
Give Glory to God
</h3>
<p>
He did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God, and being fully convinced that what He had promised He was also able to perform.. (Rom 4:20-21)<br>
Abraham strengthened his faith. Here’s how: He grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God. Begin to give glory to God – start thanking and praising Him for His every promise. Thank Him for saving you and declaring you righteous in Him. He has promised to be with us when we pass through the waters and walk through fire. He has promised to never leave us nor forsake us. He has promised that nothing will be able to separate us from His love. He has promised to give us everything we truly need to glorify Him. He has promised that we can do all things He requires through Christ who loves us. Praise Him for these things!</p>
<p>
We can look to our circumstances – it may not look like God is being faithful. <br>It may not feel like God is with us in these waters. It may Feel like He has abandoned or forsaken us. we may not sense His love. but we must not waver concerning the promise of God! Rather, we grow strong in our faith as we give glory to God, as we are fully convinced that God is able to do what He had promised.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
The Psalmist says "Why are you cast down O my soul? Hope in God for I shall yet praise him." (Psa 43:5)</font><br> Keep thanking God, keep praising Him in faith in the midst of your hard times. Say, Jesus thank You that You are with me and You have promised that Your steadfast love never ceases. Praise You that Your mercies never come to an end; they are new every morning. Great is your faithfulness.</p>
<p>
Growing stronger in our faith is not complicated. Look to God’s promise and glorify Him. So what are you going to believe today – God's word or your circumstances? God's promises or your feelings? God's bedrock pledge of faithfulness or your wavering emotions? <br>Walk in the footsteps of Abraham and strengthen your faith.</p>
