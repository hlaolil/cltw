What is the Fruit of the Spirit
</h1>
<h3>
God's Love and Work in Us
</h3>
<p>
The Fruit of the Spirit is God's love and work in us, the love of Christ flowing in through His Holy Spirit in and out of us! All because we have a personal relationship with Christ, we have God's living presence in us, living in us. <br>The result is we have the ability to reflect His Fruit and character. <br>In addition, this is a moral obligation on our part to live out our New Life in Christ effectively. This then becomes our visible evidence of our relationship and growth in Jesus Christ as our Lord and Saviour that is contagious and affects others. We display Christ by our manner, demeanour, and temperament.</p> <p>Thus, the Fruit we make becomes the influence and the display case of His transforming power. We do not do this alone; He gives us the Holy Spirit, God's active love and work within and through us so we bear and convey His attributes of Fruit and character. This means we "cultivate," add to as in supplement His Fruit, God's empowering love for us, which we are given and then we are to continue to build up by our faith development so we are able to pass this on to others (Isa 27:6; Hos 10:1; 14:8; Matt 3:8; Rom 6:22; Eph 5:9; Phil 1:11).</p>
<h3>
Cultivating and Growing
</h3>
<p>
This Fruit cultivation and production by our walk in Him creates and sets the tone for our behaviours and conduct with one another. This shows off our Lord; as we know Him, we make Him known just by our attitude. This is a cooperative endeavour that happens by our growing and close intimate relationship with Christ. As we grow by faith, which is our devotion, trust, obedience and conviction in Him, we make more and better Fruit. All this by what we add to, and what He then multiplies. Just like adding yeast to dough makes it grow, but in our case it is not meagre air, it is The Holy Spirit at work in us.</p> 
<p>This synergy (human will cooperating with the Holy Spirit) of our faith in Christ is to facilitate our active pursuit of Love as a spiritual Fruit that is built from our wondrous and incredible collaboration that we have with God to produce real, godly commitment, conviction, and the demonstration of our obedience.<br>This is what helps form our character and mature, effectual Christian life. <br>It gives us the fibre of our moral centre that stretches throughout our being, embracing and holding our relationships and opportunities together when it is sealed as a choice and commitment, and not just a feeling. <br>The Fruit of the Spirit will synergistically combine with the other godly characteristics (divine grace etc.) of our Lord to promote our ability to relate and grow in our personal faith. In so doing, we grow in our relationships, to be better to and for Him as well as others and ourselves. This is the essential essence that builds healthy families, marriages, and relationships in general, as well as healthy churches-all because we are modelling Christ! We become His display case (John 1:1,14; 14:23; Gal 5:16; 1 Peter 2:24; 1 John 4:8; 14-15).</p>
<h3>
The Fruit
</h3>
<p>
The Fruit of the Spirit (there are at least nine or more fruits) is described as a fruit because it is made up of more than one substance. Just like any fruit from a tree, such as an apple or an orange, it has juice, pulp, peel, core, segments, and seeds, all held together by a skin or rind, and attached to the tree by a stem where its nutrients flow in. So it is with our relationship in Christ.<br> If you just eat of the pulp or juice and throw out the rest, how can you grow more without the seeds? If you take the fruit off the vine and do not use it, no nutrients will flow in and thus it will wither and rot. If the vine is not cared for, the tree will die. So it is with the Fruit of the Spirit, and so it is with our relationship with Christ as well as our relationships with others for the faith.<br> God makes it and it requires the efforts of our fostering this spiritual development from our growth of faith that necessitates our tending.</p> <p>It is more than just one substance; all of its substances combined are greater than the sum of its parts creating "synergy" of faith. Thus, the Fruit of the Spirit is the physical, empowering essence from our healthy, growing relationship with the Holy Spirit that gives us the active application of a transformed life that showcases who Christ is as well as inspires and affects others.<br> In order to become more mature believers and build healthier churches, we must learn and understand these essential attributes -<br>(Hab 2:4; John 15; Rom 12; Phil 2:13).</p>
