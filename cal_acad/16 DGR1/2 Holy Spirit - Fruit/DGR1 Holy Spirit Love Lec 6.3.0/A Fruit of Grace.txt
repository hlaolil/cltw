A Fruit of Grace

<p><font color= "blue">
But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved), and raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus. (Eph 2:4-7)

<h3>
God's Mercy
</h3>
<p>
But God, who is rich in mercy. Now follows the second member of the sentence, the substance of which is, that God had delivered the Ephesians from the destruction to which they were formerly liable; but the words which he employs are different. God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive together with Christ. The meaning is, that, there is no other life than that which is breathed into us by Christ: so that we begin to live only when we are in-grafted into Him, and enjoy the same life with Himself. This enables us to see what the apostle formerly meant by death, for that death and this resurrection are brought into contrast.</p> 
<p>
To be made partakers of the life of the Son of God, — to be made alive by one Spirit, is an inestimable privilege.<br>
On this ground he praises the mercy of God, meaning by its riches, that it had been poured out in a singularly large and abundant manner. The whole of our salvation is here ascribed to the mercy of God. But he presently adds, for His great love wherewith He loved us. This is a still more express declaration, that all was owing to undeserved goodness; for he declares that God was moved by this single consideration.</p> 
<p>
John says, “In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.” "We love Him because He first loved us". (1 John 4:10,19)
<h3>
When we were Dead in Sin
</h3>
<p>
Even when we were dead in sin. These words have the same emphasis as similar expressions in another Epistle.<br><font color= "blue">
“For when we were still without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.” (Rom 5:6,8)</font><>
Whether the words, by grace you have been saved, have been inserted by another hand, I know not; but, as they are perfectly agreeable to the context, I am quite willing to receive them as written by Paul. They show us that he always feels as if he had not sufficiently proclaimed the riches of Divine grace, and accordingly expresses, by a variety of terms, the same truth, that everything connected with our salvation ought to be ascribed to God as its author. And certainly He who duly weighs the ingratitude of men will not complain that this parenthesis is superfluous.</p>
<h3>
And Raised Us Up Together. 
</h3>
<p>
The resurrection and sitting in heaven, which are here mentioned, are not yet seen by mortal eyes. Yet, as if those blessings were presently in our possession, he states that we have received them; and illustrates the change which has taken place in our condition, when we were led from Adam to Christ. It is as if we had been brought from the deepest hell to heaven itself. And certainly, although, as respects ourselves, our salvation is still the object of hope, yet in Christ we already possess a blessed immortality and glory; and therefore, he adds, in Christ Jesus.</p> 
<p>
Before this it does not appear in the members, but only in the head; yet, in consequence of the secret union, it belongs truly to the members. Some render it, through Christ; but, for the reason which has been mentioned, it is better to retain the usual rendering, in Christ. We are thus furnished with the richest consolation. Of everything which we now want, we have a sure pledge and foretaste in the person of Christ.</p>
<h3>
In the Ages to Come 
</h3>
<p>
The final and true cause — the glory of God — is again mentioned, that the Ephesians, by making it the subject of earnest study, might be more fully assured of their salvation. He likewise adds, that it was the design of God to hallow, in all ages, the remembrance of so great goodness. This exhibits still more strongly the hateful character of those by whom the free calling of the Gentiles was attacked; for they were endeavouring instantly to crush that scheme which was destined to be remembered through all ages. </p>
<p>
But we, too, are instructed by it, that the mercy of God, who was pleased to admit our fathers into the number of his own people, deserves to be held in everlasting remembrance. The calling of the Gentiles is an astonishing work of divine goodness, which ought to be handed down by parents to children, and to their children’s children, that it may never be forgotten or unacknowledged by the sons of men.</p>
<p>
The riches of His grace in His kindness. The love of God to us in Christ is here proved, or again declared, to have had its origin in mercy. That He might show the exceeding riches of His grace. How? In His kindness towards us, as the tree is known by its fruit. Not only, therefore, does he declare, that the love of God was free, but likewise that God displayed in it the riches, — the extraordinary pre-eminent riches of His grace. It deserves notice, also, that the name of Christ is repeated; for no grace, no love, must be expected by us from God, except through His mediation.</p>
