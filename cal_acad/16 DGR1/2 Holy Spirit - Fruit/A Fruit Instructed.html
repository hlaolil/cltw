A Fruit Instructed

<h3>
Grieving the Spirit
</h3>
<p>
God is a jealous God. He is not insanely or unreasonably jealous, but He created all men carefully, individually in the first place, and redeemed each who obeyed the gospel in the second. Thus He rightfully has a vested interest in continuing the fellowship which he produced by greatly extending Himself, and He is rightfully grieved when some distraction begins to pull the Christian away from that intimate companionship. The plea comes from the very heart of heaven: 
<font color= "blue">"And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption" (Eph 4:30).</font></p>
<h3>
Put them Away
</h3>
<p>
There are attitudes, actions, and statements which drive others away; after all, who wants to be close to a thorn bush or intimate with a spiky cactus? <br>
<font color= "blue">"Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamour and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice" (Eph 4:31)</font>. </p>
<p>
These are all destructive toys and ploys, and sound like a description of many families' chaotic and disorderly lives. The acid of bitterness shrivels the marrow of compassion, produces the poison of criticism, and spreads the stain of destruction through all interpersonal relationships. </p>
<p>
Unbridled wrath and explosive anger are the grenades of a still violent pagan personality, with no one around knowing for sure whether or not the pin is pulled. Clamour and shouting are the immature extension of childishness, the pounding on pots and pans in a strident demand for attention.</p> 
<p>
Slander and malice are the result of Satan's desire to cause trouble in Paradise, saying destructive things when nothing needs to be said, planning to create difficulty where the waters could remain smoothly and swiftly flowing.<br> These destructive toys and ploys, which sound like a description of many families' chaotic and disorderly lives, need "to be put away."</p>
<h3>
Implement These
</h3>
<p>
Those who make a claim to godliness are given a list of qualities to integrate into the fibre of their lives: <br><font color= "blue">"And be kind to one another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, just as God in Christ forgave you" (Eph 4:32)</font>.</p> 
<p>
There is a bumper sticker, which encourages others to "commit random and senseless acts of kindness." This is typical of the irrationality of the modern liberal, essentially anti-Christian world view.</p> 
<p>
The very essence of kindness is rooted in creative thoughtfulness; there can be no such things as "senseless acts of kindness." God wants His people to be very considerate of other's feelings and needs; God wants the saints to be tender-hearted toward one another, recognising how easily the other can fall into temptation or be carried off into wrong thought realms through Satan's influence; and God wants His children to be gracious and forgiving toward each other, in imitation of the big-heartedness and gentleness of the Christ who so graciously welcomes all who will come on His generous terms.</p>
<h3>
Don't Grieve the Spirit
</h3>
<p>
It is a basic scriptural principle:<br> <font color= "blue">"for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, how can he love God whom he has not seen"? (1 John 4:20)</font>.<br> If someone claims to walk in the light, but is bitter or wrathful rather than tender and forgiving, then he has no fellowship with spiritual brethren and consequently no fellowship with God. And the Holy Spirit grieves over this, since love was the purpose for which He was initially sent into heart of the believer (Rom 5:5).</p>
<p>
The indwelling Spirit is the pilgrim's guarantee of the resurrection to eternal life at Jesus' second coming. If He remains grieved over the condition of him who was once called out of darkness, then the guarantee is off. "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption."</p>
