Reasons for Peace
</h1>
<h2 align="center">
Fearing the Lord
 </h2>
<p><font color= "blue">
Who is the man that fears the Lord? Him shall He teach in the way He chooses. He himself shall dwell in prosperity, and his descendants shall inherit the earth. (Psa 25:12-13)</font>.</p>
<p>
You must avoid the urge to run after the crowd, stop trying to do things just because everyone is doing it. Ask yourself what have you gained from living your life this way? Has it solved the frustration, the disappointment or the lack of self fulfilment? And has it addressed the emptiness you feel inside?</p> 
<p>
Instead take the time to find out what the Lord is saying to you  and the reason being, there is a path He has chosen and ordained for you, there is a calling upon your life, there is a purpose for your being here, but you will not discover it by running after the mob. You were made a unique individual , your well being is tied to this uniqueness, and it is only together with your Maker that you can unravel that uniqueness. <br>Where do I start? Start by humbling yourself before Him. </p>
<h2 align="center">
Maturity and Righteousness
</h2>
<p><font color= "blue">
Mark the blameless man, and observe the upright; For the future of that man is peace. (Psa 37:37)</font></p>
<p>
There are many precious gems that David unearths in his declaration of who God is and who we are in relation to God in this psalm. David tells us that there is a future for the man of peace. </p>
<p>
One of the things that makes our hearts anxious is the thought of an uncertain future. Will we have enough money? Will our health hold out? Will my job be there in five years? When we look towards the future, we have more questions than we have answers. </p>
<p>
However, if we can take to heart today's promise of a guaranteed future, perhaps we will be able to breathe a little easier with the knowledge that our Father has promised us a bright future? Now you might say to yourself ...<br> "I don't feel like I am a man (or woman) of peace, so how can I know that I have a bright future?"</p>
<p>
If that is a question you ask yourself, my encouragement would be to not look within your own ability to muster up a manufactured peace, but rather look to the Prince of Peace Himself and the promise that He has already given you: <font color= "blue">Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid. (John 14:27)</font></p>
<p.
My prayer today is that the peace that passes our understanding (Phil 4:7) will guard our hearts and our minds. I pray that any fear of the future would be driven out by the love of God (1 John 4:18) so that we could boldly agree with this Scripture. There is a bright future for everyone who is yoked to the Prince of Peace!</p>
<h2 align="center">
Love for the Word
</h2>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Great peace have those who love your law, and nothing causes them stumble" (Psa 119:165)</font>.</p>
 <p>
The overall theme of this psalm is the rightness of divine law and this passage, in fact, offers a pretty good summary of the whole.<br> What's interesting and important, I think, is the use of the word love instead of obey. People often obey divine law out of fear, and while that's a better choice than ignoring the law, it doesn't plumb the depths of support available to those who truly understand that the law is not a test or punishment, but a loving guide. </p>
<p>
It is when we “love” the law of God, fully embracing the love that it represents, that it can express in our lives as a sense of absolute assurance that all is working together for good. This doesn't mean we won't have challenges and dark days. But it does mean that we will move through even the darkest shadows without stumbling in fear and uncertainty, and we will know always that there is a power for good expressing through us.</p>
<h2 align="center">
Trust in the Lord
</h2>
<p><font color= "blue">
Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion, which cannot be moved, but abides forever. As for such as turn aside to their crooked ways, the Lord shall lead them away with the workers of iniquity. Peace be upon Israel! <br>(Psa 125:1,5)</font></p>
<p>
This short psalm may be summed up in those words of the prophet,<br> <font color= "blue">"Say to the righteous that it shall be well with them. Woe to the wicked! It shall be ill with him," (Isa 3:10,11)</font> <br>Thus are life and death, the blessing and the curse, set before us often in the psalms, as well as in the law and the prophets.<br> It is certainly well with the people of God; for, they have the promises of a good God that they shall be fixed.<br> It is certainly ill with the wicked, and particularly with the apostates.</p> 
<p>
We that are members of the gospel-church may certainly, in singing this psalm, take comfort from these promises, and even more so if we stand in awe of the threatening.</p> 
<h2 align="center">
The Spiritual Mind
</h2>
<p><font color= "blue">
"For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace." (Rom 8:6)</font> </p>
<p>
Keep telling yourself that, over and over. It is vital! It is for your life. <br>To be fleshly-minded takes absolutely no effort, no study, no thought. <br>It not only just comes naturally -- it comes powerfully, and almost irresistibly.</p> 
<p>
To be spiritually-minded is the very opposite. It does take great effort, and study, and thought. And even that's not enough. It takes constant prayer and constant Divine help. It will never come naturally just by being in the Truth, and "doing the Readings," and "attending the meetings." Baptism of itself is a passport to nothing except a glorious opportunity to give ourselves joyfully to God, and be accepted by Him. </p>
<p>
To be spiritually-minded is a constant struggle, a constant self-examination and self-discipline, a constant refreshing and re-cleaning in the water of the Word and the blood of the Lamb.<br> But it alone is "life and peace," intensity of Life Forevermore, and Perfect Peace now and forever, to the depth of the soul.</p>
