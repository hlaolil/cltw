<h3>
What is Faithfulness
</h3>
<p>
The seventh manifestation of the fruit of the Spirit is translated faithfulness which is the Greek word "<i>pistis</i>" and it refers here more than just Doctrine.</p>
<p>
1.It denotes the trust that one has in another. This of course refers to our trust in God and His word, Bible Doctrine.</p>
<p>
2.As a virtue and a result of the production of the Spirit it also refers to being faithful, trustworthy, reliable, and steadfast.</p>
<p>
3.Confidence, assurance, conviction belief and Doctrine.</p>
<h3>
Holy Spirit
</h3>
<p>
Since this is another divine characteristic that is being reproduced in the believer by the Holy Spirit, we need to understand what divine faithfulness is so that we can identify that which the Holy Spirit will accomplish within us. Every believer starts with the same amount of faith but none of us end up that way. It all depends on the operation of the filling of the Spirit in our lives. Everyone has the same chance from the start of salvation. We all start out with an equal amount of faith and with equal privilege and equal opportunity, 2 Peter 1:1-4. So when we look at all of these manifestations of the fruit of the Spirit, we are looking at the ability we have to partake of the divine nature, the nature of God.</p>
<h3>
God's Faithfulness
</h3>
<p>
First of all, we begin with the principle that there is only one person who is and will ever be totally faithful to you and that of course is God. He can only be faithful to you because of His perfect character. Divine faithfulness is God's grace expression to the believer using His perfect character as the basis for expression. Faithfulness hinges on the essence of God. Because God is perfect, fair, and stable to Himself, He will be all these things to you as well. Lam 3:22-23. God is faithful to us because of the Doctrine of propitiation which says God the Father is satisfied with the sacrificial ministry of our Lord on the cross. His faithfulness, therefore, does not depend upon your spiritual status or mine. </p>
<p>
Divine faithfulness manifests itself in many different areas. Discipline to the reversionist (Someone who lapses into previous undesirable patterns of behaviour) and blessing to the adult believer. So, in reality, what is faithfulness? It is a loyal attitude to someone in your life who you love, respect, admire, or recognise their authority. God's faithfulness is also manifested in His perfect plan, 1 Col 1:9. God's faithfulness is also manifested in logistical grace provision and Supergrace blessing, 1 Thess 5:24. This is why we should never worry about the basic necessities to sustain our life. God will provide everything we will ever need.</p>
<h3>
God's Blessing and Testing
</h3>
<p>
Remember, it was harder for God to find a way to save us than it is for God to bless us in time. God's perfect faithfulness to you in eternity past inevitably leads to His perfect faithfulness to you in time. There is also God's faithfulness in testing, 1 Col 10:13, 2 Col 4:17, Rom 8:18. He will not allow us to be tested or tempted beyond our capacity and capability to pass the test or to say no to the temptation. 1 Col 10:13, Rom 8:18, 2 Col 4:17.</p>
<p>
So, you are tested in all stages of spiritual growth but never beyond your capacity. God is even faithful to the apostate believer, 2 Tim 2:13 God is also faithful in what He withholds just like in what He gives. He is faithful in sending sorrow as well as in giving joy. So God is not only faithful in stopping affliction but in sending it as well, Psa 89:33. </p>
<p>
Perhaps the greatest illustration is the faithfulness of God to you. Think of how faithful God has been to you over the years. Think of how many times you got yourself into a jam and the grace and faithfulness of God pulled you out. Think of how many times your were worried about the future and the grace and faithfulness of God still came through.
