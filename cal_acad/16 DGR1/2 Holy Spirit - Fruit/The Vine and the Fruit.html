The Vine and the Fruit
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
"I am the true vine, and My Father is the vine dresser. Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes away; and every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it may bear more fruit. You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you. Abide in Me, and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abides in the vine, neither can you, unless you abide in Me. <br>I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in Me, and I in him, bears much fruit; for without Me you can do nothing. If anyone does not abide in Me, he is cast out as a branch and is withered; and they gather them and throw them into the fire, and they are burned. If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you.<br> By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; so you will be My disciples. (John 15:1-8)</font></p>
<h3>
The Vineyard 
</h3>
<p>
Why does Jesus speak of himself as the true vine? The image of the vine was a rich one for the Jews since the land of Israel was covered with numerous vineyards. It had religious connotations to it as well. <br> Isaiah spoke of the house of Israel as <font color= "blue">“the vineyard of the Lord” (Isa 5:7)</font>.  Jeremiah said that God had planted Israel as <font color= "blue">"a noble vine,” (Jer 2:21)</font>.<br> While the vine became a symbol of Israel as a nation, it also was used in the scriptures as a sign of degeneration.  <br>Isaiah’s prophecy spoke of Israel as a vineyard which <font color= "blue">“brought forth wild grapes” (see Isa 5:1-7)</font>.<br> Jeremiah said that Israel had become a <font color= "blue">“degenerate plant of an alien vine” <br>(Jer 2:21)</font>.</p>  
<h3>
The True Vine
</h3>
<p>
When Jesus calls himself the true vine he makes clear that no one can claim their spiritual inheritance through association with a particular people or bloodline.  Rather, it is only through Jesus Christ that one can become grafted into the true “vineyard of the Lord”.  Jesus offers true life -- the abundant life which comes from God and which results in great fruitfulness. How does the vine become fruitful?  The vine dresser must carefully prune the vine before it can bear good fruit.  Vines characteristically have two kinds of branches -- those which bear fruit and those which don’t.  The non-bearing branches must be carefully pruned back in order for the vine to conserve its strength for bearing good fruit. </p> 
<h3>
Fruit of the Vine
</h3>
<p>
Jesus used this image to describe the kind of life He produces in those who are united with Him -- the fruit of <font color= "blue">“righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit” (Rom 14:17)</font>.<br>
Jesus says there can be no fruit in our lives apart from Him.  The fruit He speaks of here is the fruit of the Holy Spirit (see Gal 5:22-23). There is a simple truth here: We are either fruit-bearing or non-fruit-bearing. There is no in-between. But the bearing of healthy fruit requires drastic pruning. The Lord promises that we will bear much fruit if we abide in Him and allow Him to purify us.<br> Do you trust in the Lord's abiding presence with you?</p>
<p>
"Lord, may I be one with you in all that I say and do.  Draw me close that I may glorify you and bear fruit for your kingdom. Inflame my heart with your love and remove from it anything that would make me ineffective or unfruitful in loving and serving you as My All." </p>
