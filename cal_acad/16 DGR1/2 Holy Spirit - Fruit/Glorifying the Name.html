Glorifying the Name
</h1>
<p>
In Him also we have obtained an inheritance, being predestined according to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His will, that we who first trusted in Christ should be to the praise of His glory.</p>
<p>
When God created the world, man was the crowning jewel in all creation <br>(Gen 1:26-27). He made male and female in His image to reflect and display His glory. Mankind’s fall merely put this plan on hold it did not thwart it.</p>
<p>
When Jesus came to redeem through His death and resurrection all that was stolen in the garden, He gave birth to the Church (Col 2:18).<br>The Church is the crowning jewel in redemption. In Eph 1 alone, Paul reminds us that the inevitable result of all of God’s actions is that He will be praised and glorified (Eph 1:6,12,14).<br> The Church brings glory to God, and this was part of His master plan. <br> <font color= "blue">“to the intent that now the manifold wisdom of God might be made known by the church to the principalities and powers in the heavenly places, according to the eternal purpose which He accomplished in Christ Jesus our Lord,”<br> (Eph 3:10-11)</font>.</p>
<p>
As a result, we bring glory to God by aligning ourselves with His eternal purpose, which is to put our hope in Jesus and take our place in His Church: <font color= "blue">“which is His body, the fullness of Him who fills all in all” (Eph 1:23)</font>.</p>
<p>
Amazingly, because of what Christ did, we also obtain an inheritance, and this is a part of the spiritual blessings we have been given in Christ Jesus (Eph 1:3). But this word inheritance has a double meaning, as it is used both to describe our inheritance (which is how most translations interpret this), but it also means we were made Jesus’ inheritance. The Church, the believing followers of Christ, have become Jesus’ portion or inheritance. We are incredibly valuable to Him, as evidenced by both being the crowning jewel in redemption and being assigned as His reward for redeeming humanity—this is incredible!</p>
<p>
No wonder Paul calls the relationship between Christ and the Church a profound mystery (Eph 5:32), Christ’s purpose has always been  <font color= "blue">“that He might present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and without blemish.” (Eph 5:27)</font>.<br> Then, in the end, wrap it all up and give it back to God (1 Cor 15:24).<br> What an incredible accomplishment!</p>
<p>
Because of the immense weight of this, my prayer echoes that of the Apostle Paul for you, for me, and for the global Church, I keep asking:<br>  <font color= "blue">"that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power” (Eph 1:17-19)</font>.</p>
