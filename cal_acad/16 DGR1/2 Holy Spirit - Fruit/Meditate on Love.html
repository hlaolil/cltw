Meditate on Love
</h1>
<h3>
What is Meditation?
</h3>
<p>
Meditation is not the transcendental, existentialistic endeavours that most people think about when they hear the word.  Meditating on the Word of God is completely different than that which most people associate with meditation. <font color= "blue"> “This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.” (Josh 1:8)</font><br> Here we see that meditation is something we ought to do around the clock, besides the time we sleep of course.  The Hebrew word for meditate is <i>“hagah”</i> which means “to utter, to devise, to muse,” and “to mutter.”  The key here is that certain Bible verses are to be uttered over and over again and that we should muse over them.  The word muse is especially important in the Hebrew meaning of meditation because it means “to consider something thoughtfully and thoroughly.”  That is exactly what meditation should be; to utter it in our minds, over and over again and to consider it thoughtfully and thoroughly.</p>
<p>
The Word says <font color= "blue">“I will meditate on Your precepts and contemplate Your ways.” (Psa 119:15)</font> <br> That fits nicely with the concept of meditation ... to fix your eyes upon so we can say that meditation is contemplating, fixing our eyes (and necessarily our attention) on, considering it very carefully, thoughtfully, and thoroughly, and uttering it in the mind over and over again. <br> Meditating on the Word of God seems to be a lost art today from many Christians that I talk to yet it is one of the most beneficial ways in which we can hide His Word in our hearts.  To meditate on a Bible verse or verses is to read it (fix your eyes upon it), consider it thoughtfully, ponder it, think about it, and reflect upon it.</p>
<h3>
Meditate on God’s Faithfulness
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust under punishment for the day of judgement,” (2 Peter 2:9)</font><br>
That should be something you should memorise, not only ponder.<br> Just think of that.  God knows how to rescue “the godly out of temptations” but more than that, He knows how to “reserve the unjust under punishment for the day of judgement.”  That means we must leave vengeance to God (Rom 12:19) and that we can trust Him to deliver us and have the assurance that He will serve justice at the Great White Throne Judgement (Rev 20:11-15).</p>
<h3>
Meditate on Love
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become sounding brass or a clanging cymbal.” (1 Cor 13:1)</font><br>
Jesus once told the disciples that <font color= "blue">“By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.” (John 13:35)</font>. <br> He didn’t say “they’ll know you by your speaking in tongues, they’ll know you by your spiritual gifts, they’ll know you by your prayers, or they’ll know you by your preaching.”  Love is the identifying factor in who Jesus’ disciples are. <br> Paul took it to the extreme and said <font color= "blue">“though I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing.” (1 Cor 13:3)</font>. <br> The interesting fact is that some of those same Corinthians he was writing to would later be burned at the stake, some at Caesar’s cocktail parties as conversation pieces.</p>
<h3>
Meditate on God’s Mercy
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” (Rom 5:8)</font><br>
Most of us can imagine having to die for our family or our friends but die for our enemies?  That’s unbelievable ... at least humanly speaking. <br> When Jesus was dying an agonising death on the cross, He said:<br> <font color= "blue">“Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do.” (Luke 23:34)</font>. <br> That is something to consider long and hard. Meditate on just what that looks like in your mind’s eye.</p>
<h3>
Meditate on God’s Forgiveness
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” (2 Cor 5:21)</font><br>
Imagine that!  The sinless Son of God who knew no sin ... became sin for those of us where anything but sinless.  So He became sin for us the sinners so that God would look at us and see us as having Jesus’ own righteousness. <br> If people say that God is not fair, then consider how unfair the Father treated Jesus for our sake.</p>
<h3>
Meditate on the Lord Being with You
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Then Joseph's master took him and put him into the prison, a place where the king's prisoners were confined. And he was there in the prison. But the Lord was with Joseph and showed him mercy, and He gave him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.” (Gen 39:20-21)</font><br>
You think you had a bad day!  Joseph was accused falsely and thrown in prison but never is there a word that Joseph ever grumbled or complained. <br>In all of these different trials that Joseph endured, from his brother’s mistreatment to being imprisoned twice in Egypt, he was completely innocent.  Through all of that it was still said “And the Lord was with Joseph.”  Time and time again Joseph was mistreated, lied about, falsely accused, sold into slavery but ... the Lord was with Joseph.  This verse keeps coming to my mind when I read about others in different parts of the world who are suffering greatly and some being murdered for their faith yet they don’t grumble and complain because they know that the Lord is with them.</p>
<h3>
Meditate on God’s Compassion
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“As a father pities his children, So the Lord pities those who fear Him. For He knows our frame; He remembers that we are dust.” (Psa 103:13-14)</font><br>
Psa 103 is among my favourite chapters in the entire Bible. <br> Think of the tenderness of this psalm.  God loves His children more than a human father, He shows them compassion if they fear Him, and He understands the fragility of our frames.  He know we just dust.  He shows compassion to those that fear Him but this is not a dread or terror like the fear of being struck dead at any moment.  The fear of which the Psalmist writes is a holy, reverential fear of the deepest respect.</p>
<h3>
Meditate on our Security
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“And I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; neither shall anyone snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of My Father's hand.” <br>(John 10:28-29)</font> <br>
This is one of my favourite memory verses because it gives those who lack trust in God’s Word that they might not be saved and fear that they’ve lost their salvation the reassurance and security they need. <br> Jesus says “I give them eternal life” but if they lose it in 5 years, or 10 years, was it eternal?  No, it was 5-year life or 10-year life.  Just to reinforce what Jesus is saying about this eternal life He says that “no one will snatch them out of My hand” but there is even greater security for He adds “no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand” either.  If that isn’t security, what is?  <br>What created thing could wrestle something out of the hand of Jesus Christ or the Father?  The answer is no one or nothing as Paul declares:<br> <font color= "blue">“neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Rom 8:38-39)</font>.   That settles that!</p>
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
I included these verses to mediate on because these are ones that I have memorised. If you memorise Scripture, it is so easy to meditate on them whenever and wherever you want.  Draw on these verses when you need to meditate on God’s faithfulness, His love, His mercy, His forgiveness, His loyalty in staying with you, His compassion, and the security that can be found only in Him.  Meditate on those things for a while.
