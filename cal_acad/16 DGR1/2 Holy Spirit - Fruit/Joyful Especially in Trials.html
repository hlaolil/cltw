Joyful Especially in Trials
</h1>
<h3>
Count it All Joy
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“My brethren, count it all joy when you fall into various trials,” (James 1:2) </font>.</p>
<p>
Not many people react to hardship and tragedy with joy.<br> Most people’s initial reaction to tragedy or trials is dread or depression. Nevertheless, God’s word to us, recorded by James, is to count those trials as something joyful. <br>Now, for those without Jesus, this sounds like insanity &#8212; <br>Who would possibly count it joy when someone they love suddenly passes away?<br> Who would count it joy when he or she loses their job?</p>
<h3>
Reaction to Hardship and Tragedy
</h3>
<p>
Not many people react to hardship and tragedy with joy.<br>
However, when we belong to Jesus, and He is our Saviour and our Strength, "counting it all joy" makes perfect sense. We are in the protective hands of the Almighty Creator, Who sees all and knows all, and loves us.<br> Nothing happens that He does not either allow to happen or cause to happen. Since we are in His hands, we have nothing to fear when some unexpected trial or tragedy slams into our lives. James words reassure us that, as followers of Christ, we are never alone in whatever we face. James even tells us that God has a purpose for allowing these trials to befall us.</p>
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
Christians are not exempt from trials and tragedies; we will face hardships in life, it comes from living in a fallen world. However, if we respond by trusting God, our faith will actually be strengthened. We will emerge from the hard times, stronger and wiser for having put our trust in God to see us through.<br>
We must be aware that with every trial comes a temptation. The temptation is to trust in something, or someone, other than God to get us through it.<br>
The temptation is to become overwhelmed by our situation and believe that even God is not able to help us.</p>  
<p>
However, if we turn to God in our time of need, instead of away from Him, He will give us the strength and wisdom to get through anything the world, or Satan, throws at us. Moreover, we will emerge from those trials as stronger Christians with a more sure faith and a more vibrant witness for the glory of God.</p>
