The Source of Joy

<h3>
God is the Source and Object of Our Joy

“Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced, for God had made them rejoice with great joy; the women and the children also rejoiced, so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard afar off.” (Neh 12:43)</font></p>
<p>
That truth revolutionises all of life—from the way you spend your time to the way you interact with your family to the way you prioritise spending money. Absolutely everything in our lives is to be done for the glory of God because of our love for and joy in Him.<br>
<font color= "blue"> 
Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God (1 Cor 10:31)</font>.</p>
<h3>
God Causes Us To Rejoice
</h3>
<p>
We rejoice because God makes us do so. The text says that the people “rejoiced, for God had made them rejoice.” Apart from God, we find no true, lasting joy. We need His divine enablement to love Him as we ought and to rejoice in Him as we ought.</p>
<p>
That’s why we pray, <font color= "blue">“Oh, satisfy us early with Your mercy, That we may rejoice and be glad all our days!” (Psa 90:14)</font>. The love of God is able to gladden our hearts all of the days of our lives. It is a strong, durable delight.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Your loving kindness is better than life, (Psa 63:3). So, we plead with Him to give us joy</font>.</p>
<h3>
The Greatness of Joy in God
</h3>
<p>
The joy with which we rejoice is a great joy. Again, our passage in Nehemiah says, “God had made them rejoice with great joy.” Not only is the quantity of our joy great (“all our days”), but so is its quality.</p>
<p>
When Jesus was born, the angels declared, <font color= "blue">"Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people. For there is born to you this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord” (Luke 2:10–11)</font>. <br>The sweetest and most powerful joy we can experience is the joy that God gives us in Christ.</p>
<p>
We were once dead in our sins and separated from God without hope. But then he made us alive in Christ and saved us by his grace (Eph 2:1–10). Or, as the psalmist says, <font color= "blue">“You will show me the path of life; In Your presence is fullness of joy; At Your right hand are pleasures forevermore.” (Psa 16:11)</font>. Full joy forevermore. There is nothing greater than this joy in this God!</p>
<h3>
Making Known Our Delight
</h3> 
<p>
A joy experienced is a joy expressed. Our text in Nehemiah says that when God’s people rejoiced, “the joy of Jerusalem was heard far away.” When God makes us glad, it is not meant to simply give us a warm fuzzy feeling and stop there. Rather, out of the abundance of our joy, it springs up through the way we speak.</p>
<p>
Consider also <font color= "blue">“Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, you righteous; and shout for joy, all you upright in heart!” (Psa 32:11)</font>  We are so ecstatic because of God’s love for us in Christ that we shout for joy. It transforms not only our hearts, but also our behaviour. Returning to Psa 63:3, if the steadfast love of the Lord is better than life, then we offer a certain response. Our lips praise Him. God gives us joy through the love that He has for us, and we respond by making that joy known to others—because we simply can’t help it.</p>
<p>
Sing to the Lord, bless His name; Proclaim the good news of His salvation from day to day (Psa 96:2)!</p>
