The Seed of Love
</h1>
<p>
God wants us to know the importance of love, for love is the very essence of God.<br>
<font color= "blue">"The love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us. (Rom 5:5)</font></p>
<p>
<font color= "blue">"Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God; and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. He who does not love does not know God, for God is love." (1 John 4:7-8)</font></p>
<p>
The invisible essence of God comes into the visible realm through those who know God and love like God loves. God's love has no boundaries; it is limitless! Humanity's love is very limited; it loves self and those who add to its own self-worth. God does not call that love. His definition of love is:<br><font color= "blue"> "Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things." (1 Cor 13:4-7)</font> Human love cannot meet God's standard. God's love can only become ours in the Holy Spirit! Exemplifying this love proves that we know God, and it makes God known to the world.</p>
<p>
Love comes from God! We cannot receive it from any other source.<br> The Adam man cannot receive it because he is dead to spiritual things.<br> Only those who are born of God have love. Without knowing love we cannot know God. The two are intertwined for they are one. Therefore love is the distinguishing characteristic of God's children.</p>
<p>
Loving God also causes us to be known by God. We often feel that we know some important television stars or public personalities, but they don't know us. They have no idea that we exist.<br><font color= "blue"> "But if anyone loves God, this one is known by Him." (1 Cor 8:3)</font><br> Love brings us into a relationship with God because relationship needs a common interest, a common goal or a common pursuit - something that connects them. Since God's intrinsic being is love, a relationship with Him has to have love as its foundation. God takes notice of those who love Him. <br>The depth of love between two people establishes the depth of relationship.<br> The depth of God's love for us is beyond our comprehension, so the depth of our relationship with God depends on how much we love Him.</p>
<p>
Knowing the love of Christ is greater than knowledge. <br>Paul wrote, <font color= "blue">"to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge; that you may be filled with all the fullness of God." (Eph 3:19)</font><br> When we are filled with the love of God we are filled with the very essence of God, for God is love! His love is not a permissive and doting love.<br>That type of love would not be good for us. His love for righteousness excludes all unrighteousness. God loves us and wants the very best for us.<br> To become like Him is His goal for us, and He knows how to achieve this goal!</p>
