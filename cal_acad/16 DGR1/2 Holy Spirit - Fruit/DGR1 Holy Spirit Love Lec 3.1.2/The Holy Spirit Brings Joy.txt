<h1>
The Holy Spirit Brings Joy
</h1>
<p>
So often in Scripture the presence of joy comes along with the presence of the Holy Spirit (Acts 13:52; 1 Thess 1:6; Gal 5:22; Rom 14:17; Rom 15:13).<br> 
The link between the indwelling of the Spirit and our joy is especially noteworthy.</p> 
<p>
What Christ purchased for us, was that we might have communion with God in his good, which consists in partaking of or having communion of the Holy Spirit. All the blessedness of the redeemed consists in partaking of the fullness of Christ, their Head and Redeemer, which, I have observed, consists in partaking of the Spirit that is given Him not by measure. This is the vital sap, which the branches derive from the true vine; this is the holy oil poured on the head, that goes down to the members.</p>
<p>
Christ purchased for us that we should enjoy the love, but the love of God flows out in the proceeding of the Spirit; and He purchased for them that the love and joy of God should dwell in them, which is by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>
The sum of all spiritual good which the saints have in this world, is that spring of living water within them which we read of, John 4:10–14; and those rivers of living waters flowing from within them which we read of, John 7:38–39, which we are there told is the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>
And the sum of all happiness in the other world, is that river of living waters which flows from the throne of God and the Lamb, which is the river of God’s pleasure and is the Holy Spirit; which is often compared in Scripture to water, to the rain and dew, and rivers and floods of waters (Isa 44:3, Isa 32:15, Isa 35:6–7, Isa 41:17–18 compared with John 4:14, and Isa 43:19–20).</p>

Notice a few Key Points:</font></p>
<p>
Our joy is expensive, and the high cost is purchased for us at the cross.</p>
<p>
The Spirit’s joy is Christ’s joy first, shared with us by virtue of our union with Christ.</p>
<p>
The indwelling presence of the Spirit is the origin of spiritual joy in our lives.</p>
<p>
And perhaps most interesting to me, joy — both our joy today and our joy eternal — are both deeply embedded in our union to Christ and in the purchased permanency of the Spirit’s indwelling in our lives now and forever. Which is why there are such strong ties of continuity to be discovered between our present experience of joy in this world (no matter how disrupted and faulty and fallen), and our perfected joy that will be fully revealed in the next world.</p>
