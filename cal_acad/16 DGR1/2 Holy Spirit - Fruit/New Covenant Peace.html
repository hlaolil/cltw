New Covenant Peace
</h1>
<p>
In the second chapter of Ephesians there is a widely misunderstood passage:  <font color= "blue">“For He [Christ] Himself is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation, having abolished in His flesh the enmity, that is, the law of commandments contained in ordinances, so as to create in Himself one new man from the two, thus making peace”  (Eph 2:14-15)</font>.</p>
 <p>
What is this “middle wall of separation”.  Also, what is “the law of commandments contained in ordinances” that was abolished by Christ’s crucifixion?
We will now look at the answers to these questions, and the truth may be surprising!
Consider the context of the passage above. </p>
<h3>
Middle Wall of Separation
</h3>
<p> 
First, the verses which immediately precede the passage: <br> 
<font color= "blue">“Therefore remember that you, once Gentiles in the flesh—who are called Uncircumcision by what is called the Circumcision made in the flesh by hands— that at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.  But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ”  (Eph 2:11-13)</font>. </p> 
<p>
Now, the verses which follow the passage:<br>  <font color= "blue"> “and that He might reconcile them both to God in one body through the cross, thereby putting to death the enmity.   And He came and preached peace to you who were afar off and to those who were near.  For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father.  Now, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God”  (Eph 2:16-19)</font>.</p>
<p>
So, the entire context of this passage is a discussion of how the Jews and Gentiles had been very separate from one another, but now ---through Christ’s sacrifice--- they could become one.    Both groups could be “spiritual Israelites.”    Yes, all true Christians are Israelites ---i.e., spiritual Israelites--- Israelites by grace, not necessarily Israelites by race.   It is only through Christ that a Gentile can become a spiritually adopted Israelite---and thus become a seed (child) of Abraham---who was the father of Israel, and to whom the promises of God were made.</p>  
<p>
Speaking to Gentile-born Christians in Galatia, Paul said,<br>  <font color= "blue">“And if you are Christs', then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise  (Gal 3:29)</font>.<br> 
Now that we have the overall picture, let’s look more closely at the separation and animosity that had existed for many hundreds of years between the Israelites and Gentiles.</p>
<p>
It was, in fact, according to God’s will that the Israelites---God’s chosen people---keep themselves somewhat  separate from the rest of the world <br>  (Deut 7:2-6; 12:29-31; Jer 10:2; Num 33:51-56; Neh 13:23-27; Ex 34:15).   However, at times, Jewish religious leaders had wrongly taken this concept to an extreme.
“In the days of the apostles social interaction with gentiles ... rendered a Jew ceremonially unclean, according to the tradition of the elders. <br>  Even entering a gentile house (for example, John 18:28) or handling articles belonging to gentiles did so.  Bread, milk or olive oil coming from gentile farms and marketplaces could not be eaten by an observant Jew .... To sit down and eat with a gentile was unthinkable.”</p>
<p>
At the Jewish Temple, a literal wall separated the Jews from any Gentiles who worshipped there.   In fact, attached to this wall were multiple written commands prohibiting the Gentiles from crossing this barrier.   Excavations during 1871 and 1934 have recovered two such inscriptions which were on the wall.  <br>  One of them is as follows:  “No foreigner [non-Israelite] may enter within the barricade which surrounds the sanctuary and enclosure.   Anyone who is caught doing so will have himself to blame for his ensuing death.”</p>
<p>
It was the breaking down of that wall, to which Paul made an analogy---when he said that Christ had “broken down the middle wall of separation”  (Eph 2:14).</p>
<h3>
The Law of Commandments contained in Ordinances
</h3>
<p>
That brings us to the second question:  
What is “the law of commandments contained in ordinances,” spoken of in Eph 2:15?   Whatever it is, Eph 2:15 says that it caused “enmity [hostility],” and that it was abolished in Christ’s flesh. 
Many people assume that this refers to God’s spiritual law as summarised by the Ten Commandments.   However, such is not the case!   It was not the Ten Commandments that were nailed to the cross!    Furthermore, in no way, would Paul have stated that God’s spiritual law had been “abolished”---since Paul repeatedly endorsed God's law and knew that it remains in effect for Christians!  
What, then, were these “commandments contained in ordinances,” which caused hostility between Jews and Gentiles? </p>
<p>
The word “ordinances” in Eph 2:15, is translated from the Greek word <i>“dogma,”</i> and it refers here to human laws and decrees.  Notice a slight variation of this word---<i>“dogmatizo”</i>---which Paul used in Col 2:<br> <font color= "blue"> “Therefore, if you died with Christ from the basic principles of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to regulations--</font> <i>[dogmatizo]</i>, <font color= "blue">Do not touch, do not taste, do not handle," which all concern things which perish with the using--according to the commandments and doctrines of men?”  (Col 2:20-22)</font>.  <br>  These ordinances <i>(dogmatizo)</i> of “Do not touch, do not taste, do not handle” refer to man-made ascetic ordinances.  In fact, Col 2:22 above calls them “commandments and doctrines of men”!
So, just as the “ordinances” spoken of in Col 2:20-22 are man-made ordinances, the “ordinances” spoken of in Eph 2 are, likewise, man-made ordinances.   Furthermore, these ordinances in Eph 2 caused enmity, or hostility, between the Jews and the Gentiles. </p>
<p>
This is speaking of, on the one hand, the restrictive pharisaical decrees, which burdened and set apart the Jews---and, on the other hand, the restrictive and divisive ordinances of the Gentiles, who were under the influence of pagan philosophers.   The Gentiles---with their “great” philosophers---looked down on the Jews, just as the Jews looked down on the Gentiles.<br>
“Both sets of human ordinances [Jewish and Gentile] contributed to feelings of prejudice, animosity, suspicion, and separation between the Jews and gentiles who were being called into God’s Church.  These ordinances acted as a
"middle wall of partition.”   Some Jews who converted to Christianity found it difficult to forget and change this deeply ingrained part of their lives. </p>
<p>  
Even the Apostle Peter was affected, as evidenced in the following statement by Paul: <font color= "blue">
“Now when Peter had come to Antioch, I withstood him to his face, because he was to be blamed; for before certain men came from James, he would eat with the Gentiles; but when they came, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing those who were of the circumcision” (Gal 2: 11-12)</font>. <br>
Yes, Paul rebuked Peter.   Why?   Because Peter was not acknowledging by his actions that Christ had broken down this “wall of separation.</p>
<p>   
In conclusion, we have plainly seen that in Eph 2:15, where Paul speaks of the “commandments contained in ordinances,” he is not referring to God’s commandments.   Rather, he is referring to man-made ordinances---which he also spoke of in Col 2: 20-22.
