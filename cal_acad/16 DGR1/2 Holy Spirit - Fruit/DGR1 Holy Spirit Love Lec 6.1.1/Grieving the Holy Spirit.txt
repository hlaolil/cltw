<h1>
Grieving the Holy Spirit
</h1>
<p>
God is with us at all times by the presence of the Holy Spirit in our lives. The Holy Spirit within us guides and teaches us the things of God and reveals the truth to us in the Bible and the world around us. As the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of God, the Third Person of the Trinity, to live in accordance with the Holy Spirit is to please God and to grieve or insult the Holy Spirit, as the Bible says we are capable of doing, is to grieve Almighty God Himself.</p>
<h3>
How We can Grieve the Holy Spirit 
</h3>
<p>
The Bible tells us that, if we are not careful, we can grieve the Holy Spirit and push God away by what we say and do on a daily basis.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Insulting the Spirit of God </font></p>
<p>
Deliberately continuing to sin after we know what is true; <br>
<font color= "blue">"For if we sin wilfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful expectation of judgement, and fiery indignation which will devour the adversaries. Anyone who has rejected Moses' law dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, counted the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing, and insulted the Spirit of grace?" (Heb 10:26-29)</font></p>

Lying to the Holy Spirit</font></p>
<p>
But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thine heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land? Whiles it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God. (Acts 5:3-4)
<p><font size="+1">
Resisting the Holy Spirit</font></p>
<p> 
Disagreeing or fighting against what He is telling us;<br>
<font color= "blue">"You stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears! You always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, so do you". (Acts 7:51)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">
Quenching the Spirit in Our Lives</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Do not quench the Spirit. (1 Thess 5:19)</font>
<p><font size="+1">
Making the Holy Spirit Sad or Offended </font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but what is good for necessary edification, that it may impart grace to the hearers. And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamour, and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice. And be kind to one another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, just as God in Christ forgave you". (Eph 4:29-32)</font></p>
<p>
We must be very careful, because if we continually refuse to listen to the Spirit and instead choose to offend God, even though He is patient, He will eventually stop speaking to us. We must therefore make every effort to become more acquainted with the sound of God’s voice. If we do this, then we will truly be following in the footsteps of Jesus and on the right path in life. We must try our hardest to listen and acknowledge what He is saying to us and pray for assistance in order to obey God’s wishes in our everyday lives.</p>
<p>
As it is not possible to live an abundant life and overcome our struggles with sin without the power of the Holy Spirit in our lives, we must be very careful to listen to His voice and respond when He speaks. When God sees that we are willing to find out what He wants, He will help us through His Spirit and even pray on our behalf so that we can find His will and then do it.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God. (Rom 8:26-27)</font></p>
<p>
By living in obedience to the Holy Spirit within us we will experience both God’s power and His comfort.</p>
<h3>
The Consequences of Grieving the Holy Spirit
</h3>
<p>
Here are four consequences of grieving the Holy Spirit:<br>

Our study of the Bible will become dry and boring;<br>
We will lose the assurance of being saved and peace and comfort will be difficult to find;<br>
We will not display the fruits of the Spirit such as kindness, love and self-control;<br>
Our ability to tell right from wrong will be compromised.</p>
<p>
Do you recognise any of these troubles in your own life? If we find ourselves in this situation, we should examine ourselves, recognise the sins in our life and where we have quenched the Holy Spirit and repent and ask for forgiveness.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. (1 John 1:9)</font><br>
God is patient and faithful towards us, so be confident that He will forgive you and return to walking in step with the Spirit of Christ.</p>
<p>
As you read the full Bible verses about the Holy Spirit, consider the times when you have been grieving the Holy Spirit and make a resolution to avoid doing it again.</p>
