<h1>
The Product of Your Heart
</h3>
<h3>
Your Sins Proceed from Your Heart
</h3>
<p>
According to Jesus, no one sins in spite of having a clean heart. On the contrary, our sins are evidence of the impurity of our heart. Jesus said,<font color= "blue"> “But those things which proceed out of the mouth come from the heart, ... For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies.” (Matt 15:18-19)</font>.</p>
<p>
You can’t use profanity and – when someone calls you on it – say, “Well, God knows my heart.” Your heart is the place from which that profanity came. If you’re living with someone you’re not married to, the excuse that God knows your heart won’t cut it. Your sexual immorality is the product of your unclean heart.</p>
<p>
You don’t sin in spite of having a clean heart; you sin because there is something wrong in your heart.</p>
<h3>
You Cannot Hide Your Heart from God
</h3>
<p>
The realisation that God knows our hearts should humble us to repent, not embolden us to sin. You can hide your heart from the world. You can appear righteous and godly to others, even if your heart is rotten to the core, but God knows the truth. He sees your heart.</p>
<p>
The Pharisees wanted people to believe they were righteous, when really they were evil. What they were was not evident to the people because the people couldn’t see their hearts, but God could. Jesus said <font color= "blue">For you cleanse the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of extortion and self-indulgence. (Matt 23:25-26)</font>. He said <font color= "blue">For you are like whitewashed tombs which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness.” (Matt 23:27)</font>.<br>
Jesus could see what others could not. He could see their hearts.</p>
<h3>
If Your Life is Bad - Your Heart is Worse
</h3>
<p>
All of this should teach us that our heart is not better than our life, it is almost always worse. There are things lurking in the darkness of our hearts that have not yet manifested themselves outwardly. But God knows our dirty little secrets. He knows our greed, our lust, our selfishness, our pride, and our bitterness.<br>
He knows our life as well. He knows the things we’ve said, the people we’ve hurt, the places we’ve gone, and the good deeds we’ve failed to do. He knows all of it.</p>
<h3>
Justification is at the Cross - Not Your Heart
</h3>
<p>
When I think about the fact that God knows my heart, it drives me to my knees and makes me pray, as David did:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Have mercy upon me, O God, according to Your loving kindness; according to the multitude of Your tender mercies, blot out my transgressions. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin. ... Create in me a clean heart, O God, And renew a steadfast spirit within me. Do not cast me away from Your presence, And do not take Your Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of Your salvation, And uphold me by Your generous Spirit.” (Psa 51:1-2,Psa 51:10-12)</font></p>
<p>
The realisation that God knows my heart makes me realise what a wretch I am. It makes me so thankful for the blood of Jesus. It makes me look – not to my heart for justification – but to the cross for justification. I have sinned outwardly and I have sinned inwardly. The only hope I have is Jesus.</p>
<p>
So I beg you to realise that God will hold you accountable for the sins of your mouth, the sins of your hands, and the sins of your heart unless you repent and allow Him to wash you clean in the blood of Jesus Christ:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded. Lament and mourn and weep! Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and He will lift you up.” (James 4:8-10)</font></p>
