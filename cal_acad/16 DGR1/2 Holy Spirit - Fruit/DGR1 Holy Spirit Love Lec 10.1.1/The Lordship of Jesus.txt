The Lordship of Jesus

"if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. (Rom 10:9-10)</font></p>
<h3>
Openly Declare Jesus Christ as Our Lord
</h3>
<p> 
When we confess (declare) Jesus Christ as Lord we become born again believers. It takes that same kind of faith to confess that Jesus is your healer and provider. We first need to believe in our heart, according to the Word of God, then confess that Word out of our mouths. It's very important to remember that you have to believe in what you are saying so it can bring results. Only when we release our faith from our mouth can we expect the results, such as self control, to manifest. </p>
<p>
Faith can be released without prayer when we believe in what we say. <font color= "blue">"For with the heart one believes and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation" (Rom 10:10)</font>. In other words, if we line ourselves up with the Word of God, by confessing what the Word says about us, then our own minds will be convinced and made confident of how God sees us. Doubt, unbelief and intimidation will be removed. </p>
<p>
We are admonished in the Word of God to confess who or what we are in Christ.<font color= "blue"> "Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful." (Heb 10:23)</font>. We can use the Scriptures to establish a confession that will not waver, but trust firmly in God.  A good starting point is, <font color= "blue">"You are of God, little children, and have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world." (1 John 4:4)</font></p>
<p>
To build confidence in us, we could say, "Greater is He (Jesus) that is in me, than he (Satan) that is in the world." Or, <font color= "blue">"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me" (Phil 4:13)</font>. <font color= "blue">"we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us" (Rom 8:37)</font>. There are many more scriptures that we can use to remove doubt and unbelief. </p>
<p>
For removing intimidation there is - "For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of a sound mind." (2 Tim 1:7) We can also say, "God has not given me the spirit of timidity of fear, but He has given me a spirit of power and of love and of calm and well-balanced mind and discipline and self control". An overcoming Christian will line up with the Word and demonstrate their conviction with corresponding actions.</p>
<p>
Confession will change our natural conditions, as well as our spiritual condition. <font color= "blue">"For assuredly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, "Be removed and be cast into the sea," and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that those things he says will be done, he will have whatever he says." (Mark 11:23)</font> The more we speak the answer, or what we have in Christ, the more change will be made in the natural and in our spiritual condition. But, we have to believe what we confess. For when we confess out of our heart it brings possession into the natural realm.</p> 
<p>
Another example of confession is: <font color= "blue">"There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus ..." (Rom 8:1)</font> Here is the confession that this scripture produces: "Because I am in Christ Jesus, right now, I don't have a sense of condemnation." </p>
<h3>
Keeping a Balance With the Word 
</h3>
<p>
Years ago, when I went to Bible school, I often heard people confess things like, "God is going to make me rich," or "God is going to give me a new car," and so on. Many people confessed things they didn't believe or that didn't line up with the Word of God. Some students thought if they just confessed these things enough they would receive them. <br>
The Bible does teach that we can have whatever the Word says we can have, but we have to keep a balance in our confession through our behaviour and actions.</p>
<p>
Believers confess many things, but often there's no true fruit produced of what they are claiming and confessing. Why? They do it for a show or to make others think they are spiritual. Let's not be that type of Christian. </p>
<p>
Titus shows us that believers who don't walk with God yet try to work the Word are reprobate and disobedient to God's commandments. <font color= "blue">"They profess to know God; but in works they deny Him, being abominable, and disobedient, and disqualified for every good work." (Titus 1:16) </font></p>
