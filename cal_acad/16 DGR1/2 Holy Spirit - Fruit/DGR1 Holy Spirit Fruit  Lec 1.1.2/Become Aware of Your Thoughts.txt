<h3>
Our Brains
</h3>
<p>
The fact is, our own brains have their "fallen nature", and the false training they had received prior to becoming saved Christians. There are also the effects of the media, news, propaganda (movies, TV, radio, music, etc) and constant seeds being spat at Christians to attack their faith.</p>
<p>
What we are exposed to can create "pathways" in the brain, that can light up suddenly when a nerve signal fires through it. This can bring up evil we have been exposed to, in a sort of thought form. These thoughts can even mix with our daily life: seeming as if new thoughts, rather than what they actually are: traumatized memories.</p>
<p>
There are countless chemicals in our environment (such as perfume, fragranced laundry products, etc) that are messing with peoples ability to process thoughts properly. There are also evil spirits, enemies, and what the Bible calls "seducing spirits", trying to seduce people into sin and lies. Regardless of which is trying to cause influence, the fact is that no matter how strong and good of a Christian someone becomes, thoughts will come into their mind. These thoughts need to be kept in check. The brain is a wonderful tool for processing information, but it needs to be monitored and kept under control. Keeping our thoughts in check is one of the many differences between saved Christians and the rest of the world.</p>

Parables
</h3>
<p>
(Examples) for understanding 2 Cor 10:5 ...</p>
<p><font size="+1">
1. Two people suddenly have blasphemous thoughts</font></p><p>
These thoughts come into their head against Jesus Christ.</p>
<p> 
The saved Christian renounces the thought (rejects it), recognizing that it is not the truth, and not part of who they are as a Christian, and reassures (perhaps even proclaims out loud) the truth instead, that Jesus Christ is God and their Lord and Saviour. They have taken their thought in obedience to Christ. 
The other person however, is deceived by the enemy into thinking that this blasphemous thought is what they must truly think about Jesus Christ (thinking: after all it's in their head), thus they have accepted it and it will work to destroy them.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
2. Two people suddenly have sexual lust thoughts</font></p><p>
These thoughts in their head are clearly proclaimed as damnable sin in the Bible.</p>
<p>The saved Christian renounces the thought (rejects it), recognizing that it is not acceptable, and not part of who they are as a Christian, and reassures (perhaps even proclaims out loud) the truth instead, that Jesus Christ / God has designed them in truth, and given them the truth about what is and isn't acceptable in his eyes sexually.
The other person however, is deceived by the enemy into thinking that this sexual lust thought in their head must be who they are as a person sexually (thinking: after all it's in their head), thus they have accepted it and it will work to destroy them.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
3. Two people are tempted to steal.</font></p><p>
The saved Christian renounces the temptation / thought (rejects it), recognising that it is not the truth, and not part of who they are as a Christian, and reassures (perhaps even proclaims out loud) the truth instead, that they are not a thief, and God has condemned theft.
The other person gives in to the temptation, steals, and becomes a thief.</p>

God / Jesus Know Your Thoughts

God Almighty knows your very thoughts. It's not simply your actions that He will take into account. He needs to know that you reject evil thinking, and do not accept nor act upon it!</p>
