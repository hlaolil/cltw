The Washing of Regeneration
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
"not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He 

saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit," 

(Titus 3:5)</font></p>
<h3>
Introduction
</h3>
<p>
Notice the word regeneration in Titus 3:5: “He [God] saved us, not 

because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to His own mercy, by 

the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit.” Regeneration is 

another way of speaking about the new birth or the second birth or being born 

again.<br> So that is our focus. The new birth or regeneration.</p>
<h3>
Signals About the New Birth
</h3>
<p>
Consider an unusual signal about what the new birth is.<br> The word for regeneration 

in Titus 3:5 “[God] saved us ... by the washing of regeneration” is used only 

one other place in the entire Bible.<br> Jesus said to the twelve apostles:<br> <font 

color= "blue"> "Assuredly I say to you, that in the regeneration, when the Son of 

Man sits on the throne of His glory, you who have followed Me will also sit on 

twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.” (Matt 19:28)</font> <br>This a 

reference to the rebirth of the creation.<br> It’s like saying: <font color= "blue">
“the new heavens and the new earth” (Isa 65:17;66:22)</font> that Isaiah spoke about.

</p>
<h3>
The Regeneration of All Creation
</h3>
<p>
Jesus conceives of the new birth as something that will happen to all creation, 

not just human beings. Humans are not the only beings that are fallen and defiled 

and disordered. The whole creation is. Why is that? <br>The answer is that, when 

human beings sinned at the very beginning, God made all creation a visible 

display of the horrors of sin. Disease, degeneration, natural disasters—these are 

all part of the visual, audible, touchable images of the moral outrage that sin 

entered the world and pervades the world.</p>
<p>
The most important passage in the Bible about this is Rom 8:20-23.<br> And it’s 

important because it confirms and clarifies what Jesus said about the creation 

undergoing a “new birth”—the “regeneration.”</p>
<p>
The creation [All of it! Not just the people.] was subjected to futility, not 

willingly, but because of Him who subjected it, [namely, God, since only God can 

subject the creation to futility in hope] in hope that the creation itself will 

be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of 

the children of God. [There will be a great renewal someday and it will happen so 

that creation joins the children of God in their glorious renewal.]<br> For we know 

that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth 

until now. [There’s the imagery of new birth, just like Jesus said.] <br>And not only 

the creation, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan 

inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.</p>
<p>
So if we put it all together, the picture seems to be something like this:<br> God’s 

purpose is that the entire creation be born again. That is, the whole universe 

will replace its futility and corruption and disease and degeneration and 

disasters with a whole new order—a new heaven and a new earth.<br> This will be the 

great, universal regeneration. The great, universal new birth.</p>
<p>
When Paul uses this word in Titus 3:5, he wants us to see that our new birth is a 

part of that. The newness we have by virtue of our regeneration now is the first 

fruits of the greater newness we will have when our bodies are made new as a part 

of the universe being made new.<br> Paul said,<font color= "blue">
“we also who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within 

ourselves, eagerly waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body.” (Rom 

8:23)</font></p>
<p>
So when you think of your new birth, think of it as the first instalment of what 

is coming. Your body and the whole world will one day take part in this 

regeneration. God’s final purpose is not spiritually renewed souls inhabiting 

decrepit bodies in a disease and disaster ravaged world.<br> His purpose is a renewed 

world with renewed bodies and renewed souls that take all our renewed senses and 

make them a means of enjoying and praising God.</p>
<p>
When you hear the word regeneration in Titus 3:5, hear it that big. <br>“[God] saved 

us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to His own 

mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit.”<br> When he 

says that the aim of the new birth is <font color= "blue">
“having been justified by His grace we should become heirs according to the hope 

of eternal life.” (Titus 3:7)</font> he means heirs of everything included in 

that eternal life—new heavens, new earth, new body, new perfected relationships, 

new sinless sight of all that is good and glorious, and new capacities for a kind 

of pleasure in God that will exceed all your dreams.</p>
<p>
That’s the unusual signal of what the new birth is: It’s the first instalment of 

the final, universal regeneration of the universe.</p>
<h3>
Why We Need This Regeneration
</h3>
<p>
Then there is a clear signal why we need this regeneration.<br><font color= "blue"> 

“For we ourselves were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various 

lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another.” 

(Titus 3:3)</font><br> That is not a description of the material creation. That’s a 

description of the human heart. Those are all moral evils, not physical evils. 

Foolish. Disobedient. Led astray. Slaves to sinful pleasures. Malice. Envy. Hated 

and hating.<br> We are all in there somewhere.</p>
<p>
The reason we need regeneration is that God will not welcome such hearts into His 

new creation.<br> As Jesus said,<font color= "blue">
"Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the 

kingdom of God." (John 3:3)</font>. This is why all of us must be born again.</p
