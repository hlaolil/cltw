Let the Righteous Be Glad

“But let the righteous be glad, let them rejoice before God, let them rejoice exceedingly”. (Psa 68:3)</font></p>
<p>
In this verse, God calls upon all those who are in a right relationship with Him to be glad and rejoice. This is a thought that is constantly brought before us in Scripture; righteousness and rejoicing. For example in Psa 32, which deals with the blessedness of the man whose sins are forgiven, David ends the psalm with a burst of praise saying, <font color= "blue">“Be glad in the Lord and rejoice, you righteous; and shout for joy, all you upright in heart! (Psa 32:11)</font>. By way of contrast, the previous verse has a solemn warning, <font color= "blue">“Many sorrows shall be to the wicked;” (Psa 32:10)</font></p>
<p>
A wealth of good things is promised to those who are living in harmony with their creator. For example we read: <font color= "blue">“The work of righteousness will be peace, and the effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance forever”. (Isa 32:17)</font> Again, in  we read, <font color= "blue">“God gives wisdom and knowledge and joy to a man who is good in His sight;” (Eccl 2:26)</font> These treasures are lavished on those whose first priority is to have a loving, intimate relationship with the Lord.</p>

This is not to suggest that the Christian will not experience times of testing and trial. We are told that these will happen, but in every adverse circumstance of life God has assured us of His unfailing sympathy and support. <font color= "blue">“God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble”. (Psa 46:1)</font></p>

To return to our theme of the blessings associated with righteousness, we might well ask just how a sinful person may become righteous in the sight of a holy God. To begin with, we learn from Rom 3:10 that, apart from those who have had a born again experience, “there is none righteous, no not one” and that all the world stands “guilty before God” (Rom 3:7). But the good news is that God has provided the means whereby guilty men and women may be accounted righteous in God’s sight on the grounds of faith in the Lord Jesus and quite apart from any effort of their own. The book of Romans abounds with this truth. 
For example, we read in chapter four of Abraham who <font color= "blue">“believed God and it was accounted to him for righteousness.” (Rom 4:3)</font> and <font color= "blue">just as David also describes the blessedness of the man to whom God imputes righteousness apart from works: "Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; Blessed is the man to whom the Lord shall not impute sin” (Rom 4:6-8)</font>. Receiving such a priceless gift on the grounds of simply believing God’s Word may seem difficult for many, because in the normal course of events we receive a reward as a result of our earning it (Rom 4:4), but God’s way of  blessing us is quite different. In the next verse we read <font color= "blue">“But to him that does not work, but believes on Him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness”. (Rom 4:5)</font>  This gift of righteousness is beautifully described, where we read, <font color= "blue">“I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my soul shall be joyful in my God for He has clothed me with the garments of salvation, He has covered me with the robe of righteousness”. (Isa 61:10)</font> God, by His grace, assures us of His acceptance of us and then calls us, out of our love for Him, to live a righteous life and to serve Him with our whole heart. </p>

So, we conclude where we began in Psa 68:3, “But let the righteous be glad, let them rejoice before God, let them rejoice exceedingly”.
