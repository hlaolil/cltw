Christian Character

<p><font color= "blue">
"Now as he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgement to come, Felix was afraid and answered, “Go away for now; when I have a convenient time I will call for you". (Acts 24:25)</font></p>
<h3>
Paul Before Felix  
</h3>
<p>
Felix was the governor of Judea from A.D. 52 to 59. Paul was sent to him to be tried of the charges the Jewish leaders had made. <br>It was said that he had <font color= "blue">"more accurate knowledge of the Way" (Acts 24:22)</font>. When he had this opportunity to hear more about 'the Way',<br> <font color= "blue">"he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ". (Acts 24:24).</font></p>
<p>
In speaking about faith in Christ Jesus, it is interesting that he chose to reason "about righteousness and self-control and the coming judgement" (Acts 24:25). This is in fact part of one's faith in Jesus. Believing the Jesus was the Son of God should cause one to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present age.</p>
<p>
Righteousness can refer to one's relationship with God. It also speaks of the manner of life that such a believer in Jesus would live. We always are to do what is right. Doing what is right often means doing that which is difficult, costly, and painful. Doing what is right often goes against the cultural mores that surround us. Yet, in all situations we are to choose to do what is right.</p>
<p>
This will take a great deal of self-control. I have no control over what others think and do although I may have some influence in that regard. I am to take the responsibility of controlling my self. This aligns with the above comments on doing what is right. When I am tempted to do what is wrong I must control myself.</p>
<p>
These all point to the other aspect of the teaching of Jesus and that is the judgement to come.<br> Jesus warned that <font color= "blue">"... the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves will hear His voice and come forth—those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation." (John 5:28–29)</font>.<br>Even Felix would stand before the judgement seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10). </p>
