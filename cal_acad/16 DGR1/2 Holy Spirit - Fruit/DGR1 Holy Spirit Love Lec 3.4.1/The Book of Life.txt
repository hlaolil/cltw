<p>
The Book of Life is a record written by God before the creation of the world, listing people who will live forever in the kingdom of heaven.The term appears in both the Old Testament and New Testament. In the Psalms, those who are obedient to God among the living are considered worthy. In other occurrences in the Old Testament, "opening of the books" typically refers to the Final Judgement.</p>

The prophet Daniel mentions a heavenly court: <font color= "blue">The court was seated, And the books were opened. (Dan 7:10)</font>.</p>

The Book of Life in Judaism
</h3>
<p>
In Judaism today, the Book of Life plays a role in the feast known as <i>Yom Kippur</i>, or Day of Atonement. The ten days between <i>Rosh Hashanah</i> and <i>Yom Kippur</i> are days of repentance, when Jews express remorse for their sins through prayer and fasting. Jewish tradition tells how God opens the Book of Life and studies the words, actions, and thoughts of every person whose name He has written there. If a person's good deeds outweigh or outnumber their sinful acts, his or her name will remain inscribed in the book for another year.On the most holy day of the Jewish calendar--<i>Yom Kippur</i>, the final day of judgement--each person's fate is sealed by God for the upcoming year.</p>

The Book of Life in Christianity
</h3>
<p>
Jesus Christ alludes to the Book of Life when He tells the 70 disciples to <font color= "blue">"rejoice because your names are written in heaven." (Luke 10:20)</font><br>
Paul says the names of his fellow missionary workers <font color= "blue">"are in the Book of Life." (Phil 4:3)</font> At the Last Judgement, believers in Christ are assured that their names are recorded in the Lamb's Book of Life and that they have nothing to fear.</p> 
<p>
The Lamb, of course, is Jesus Christ (John 1:29), who was sacrificed for the sins of the world. Unbelievers, however, will be judged on their own works, and no matter how good those works were, they cannot earn that person salvation: <font color= "blue">"And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire." (Rev 20:15).</font> Christians who believe a person can lose their salvation point to the term "blotted out" in connection with the Book of Life. They cite Rev 22:19, which refers to people who take away or add to the book of Revelation. 
It seems logical, however, that true believers would not try to take away or add to the Bible. </p>
<p>
Two requests for blotting out come from men: Moses in Ex 32:32 and the psalmist in Psa 69:28. God denied Moses' request that his name be removed from the Book. The request of the psalmist to blot out the names of the wicked asks God to remove his ongoing sustenance from the living.Believers who hold to eternal security say Rev 3:5 shows that God never blots out a name from the Book of Life. They further argue that God, who knows the future, would never list a name in the Book of Life in the first place if it would have to be blotted out later.The Book of Life assures that God knows His true followers, keeps and protects them during their earthly journey, and brings them home to Him in heaven when they die.</p>
