Inner Beauty

rather let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in the sight of God. (1 Peter 3:4)</p>
<h3>
 The Beauty of Christian Character
</h3>
<p>
I want to share my devotional thoughts about spiritual adornment of the inner man. We live in a time when shallowness of life and vanity are very evident in the life of many Christians. Our western society is saturated with idea of sex and erotic language, the way many Christians dress is often evidence of their inner attitude toward sanctification and modesty.</p>
<p>
Appearances can be deceiving, men look on the outside but God looks on the inside. Outer modesty without inner modesty is legalistic and hypocritical. On the other hand inner holinesses without self-control and modesty in the way we dress and behave is a contradiction. Modesty is an attitude of heart expressed in our daily life with words, actions, behaviour and the way we dress too.</p>
<p>
Jesus was meek and lowly, He loved people with unconditional love and had compassion for the needy and the sick. We are called to live in the spirit and walk in the Spirit and that means not only to have a daily intimate communion with God but to work out with fear and trembling our salvation. Paul prayed for Christians that Christ may be formed in them, spiritual formation is something that many have lost track of.</p>
<p>
In this day of clamour and emotionalism, or dry intellectualism among Christians we often go to the extremes and are out of balance. Carnality is the norm of the day not spirituality. Faith often is either a matter of mental consent to a doctrinal set or an emotional state of wild fire. I have been in these unhallowed grounds myself and so I talk from experience.</p>
<p>
We need to cultivate by the grace of God virtues that will help us to grow in the grace and knowledge of Jesus and be steadfast in our faith.</p>
<p>
Gentleness and quietness of the spirit is the fruit of the Spirit. How often do we see a spirit of humility, meekness and quietness in churches today? Where is the holy silence, the wonder and awe that comes from the presence and knowledge of the holy God? We don't often see these things today in local churches we attend, and the reason is simple - we are out of tune with God.</p>
<p>
If our spiritual vision was clear we would be shocked at the inner reality of the lives many of us lead. Unfortunately many don't have this prophetic insight into the condition and state of the church.</p> 
<p>
God is delighted when He sees in us the image of His Son formed and expressed in our daily life. Do we long and desire to be a reflection of the glory of God to other people that we encounter in our life? </p>
<p>
There is something irresistible about the love of God that attracts people to the cross, instead of scaring them away. There is a spiritual state of pure love we need to seek and desire in our inner man. This perfect love casts out fear that comes from the devil, sin and the world and moulds our character to be like that of Jesus.</p>
