When There is No Peace
</h1>
<p>
In the context of current political and religious issues, I have been thinking a lot about this verse of wisdom. </p>
<p><font color= "blue">
When a man's ways please the Lord, he makes even his enemies to be at peace with him. (Prov 16:7)</font></p>
<p>
There are several things to note about this verse. Most important is that it is a proverb, not a law. This is wisdom that is wise when it is applied correctly in the right situations, but it is not a law that governs all situations regardless of context. Scripture is the best commentary on itself, and we know this proverb doesn't teach that any time your enemy is against you that you are clearly not pleasing the Lord. Cain and Abel are the first example. Abel's sacrifice clearly was pleasing to the Lord, yet Cain killed him.<br> Jesus and Paul teach us of the reality of persecution as well.<br> Jesus says <font color= "blue"> “Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake.” (Matt 5:11)</font>.</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, this is a wise proverb. And I've felt the Spirit pressing me into the truth of this proverb and moving me to wrestle with Him on how to apply it in ways that are actually wise. <br>

First, this is about pleasing the Lord. These are our actions and responses that He finds pleasing, acceptable, or delightful. And what does He find pleasing, acceptable, and delightful? Those things that reflect Him. It's our first and most important task – bearing His image in His creation. I'm reminded of God's words of David whom He called a man after God's own heart. <br>Something about how David thought reflected how God thought. <br><font color= "blue">“Let the words of my mouth and meditations of my heart be acceptable in Your sight, ...” (Psa 19:14)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service. And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. (Rom 12:1-2)</font> <br>
This is a great verse on which to meditate. There, it's not conformity to the world, but conformity to the will of God – those things He finds good, acceptable, and perfect.</p>
<p>
It's interesting to have this wisdom in Proverbs that links such transformation that leads us to pursue God's loves and desires with a surprising peace with even our enemies. I've run with a lot of different denominations and independent churches of various backgrounds. I don't remember a time growing up in any of these churches when their teaching linked obedience to God with peace with our enemies.</p>
<p>
Yet that is the wisdom from Proverbs. He makes even his enemies at peace with him. The word even indicates that he has expansive peaceful relationship. <br>It's not just his enemies, but this peace in relationships extends from those closest to him out. It's shalom—that amazing, sometimes nebulous state that dominates instructions in Scripture. It's the ultimate manifestation of human flourishing. Peace.</p>
<p>
All that to say, Prov 16:7 gives us valuable wisdom that isn't to be thrown out even if you believe that we are now in the last days heading down a road of increasing persecution until Christians are marginalised in the corner trying to beat off persecutors. If you tend more to believe that His kingdom has come and is coming more and more, that He ushered in something at His death and resurrection that is transforming the whole of the world, it's probably easier to envision how Prov 16:7's wisdom applies today.</p>
<p>
Prov 16:7 gives us wisdom that guards us against the Us vs Them mentality that has characterised mankind since Cain vs Abel. Despite repeated instructions by Jesus and Paul on a correct view of, love for, and response to our perceived enemies, Christians still to this day default back into an Us vs Them mentality every time a major issue comes up. I can't control the mass tendencies of those who call themselves Christians, but I can, as the Holy Spirit applies Scripture to myself, make a difference in my own response. Christ Himself is the great example of what it looks like to please the Lord. </p>
<p>
If you struggle today envisioning this for yourself, the Gospels are always a good place to start. When I ask myself what is pleasing to God in this moment, always, the first rule that comes to mind is Loving God with all my heart and loving my neighbour as myself. If you, like me, then wonder next, “Well, what does loving my neighbour look like in this context,” I'll leave you with Paul's clear definition of this love which for me usually removes any doubt whatsoever of what I need to do next. </p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never fails. (1 Cor 13:4-8)</font></p>
