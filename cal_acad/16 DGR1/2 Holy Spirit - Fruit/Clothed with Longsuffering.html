Clothed with Longsuffering
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, longsuffering; bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint against another; even as Christ forgave you, so you also must do.” (Col 3:12-13)</font></p>
<h3>
Physical Clothing
</h3>
<p>
Every morning we get up we take great care in clothing ourselves. <br>We pick out just the right outfit that we like to think portrays who we are.<br> We make sure our clothes are clean, pressed and straight. We not only want to look good but if truth be known we want others to think we look good as well. So in the physical world we take great care on how we dress each day.</p>
<h3>
Spiritual Clothing
</h3>
<p>
What about the spiritual world? Do you take great care in how you clothe yourself spiritually when you get up? Do you care what God thinks of you enough to clothe yourself in the way He thinks you will look good? <br>If yes ... great! If no ... then it's time to evaluate your spiritual clothing.<br> Are you compassionate when you see a homeless person on the street and offer some help or do you say "get a job" like everyone else and walk on by? </p>
<p>
Do you show kindness when someone calls you up and needs your help or do you see them on your caller ID and not pick up the phone knowing they are going to ask you for help and not wanting to deal with them that day?<br> Are you humble when someone cuts in front of you in a line or in a car or do you go off on them and mutter how rude they are? Are you gentle when helping others or do you get mad easily? Are you patient with your children, setting an example or do you explode on them out of irritation?</p>
<p>
It doesn't matter if you are at home or outside the home, you must always take great care in clothing yourself spiritually just as much as physically.<br> Remember ... people can see your spiritual clothing by how you speak and act and those clothes can become just as wrinkled and tattered as your physical clothes and can be seen just as easily.</p>
<h3>
Bearing With People
</h3>
<p>
It takes an enormous amount of humility to bear with people that we do not like, but our capacity to do so says a lot about how we understand what the Lord has done for us. When we bear with people in our lives that are difficult, messy, frustrating and irritating, we reflect the love of Jesus that He has shown us. <br>God continues to love us in the midst of all that we do, and that should bring us the humility to bear with one another.<br>
For today, if you need to, identify one person who you struggle with and pray for them.</p>
<h3>
Forgiveness
</h3>
<p>
Forgiveness is one of the most central aspects to the Christian faith.<br> The basis for this command is that the Lord has forgiven us. Let us not forget that through Jesus we are forgiven of all the ways we have rebelled against God and offended His holiness. Out of that, we should have the humility to forgive one another.<br>
Remember: forgiving is not the same as forgetting. Nor is it the same as reconciliation, which takes two willing people. Forgiveness is the excruciatingly difficult process of releasing your desire for revenge and allowing yourself to see the other as you are – broken and in need of God’s grace. God has given us one medicine for the emotional pain others have inflicted, and that’s forgiveness.<br>
For today, if you need to, ask God for the strength to forgive someone who hurt you.</p>
