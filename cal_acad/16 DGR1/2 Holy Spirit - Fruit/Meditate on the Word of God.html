Meditate on the Word of God
</h1>
<p>
We have read from Scripture that there is so much good that can come from meditating on the Word of God. <br> The shortest verse in the Bible is <font color= "blue">“Jesus wept” (John 11:35)</font>.  I tried to meditate on this shortest of verses and found it to be one of the most powerful verses in the entire Bible.  I thought of why Jesus wept, what He was weeping for, who He was weeping over, and how He showed such depth of emotion in His love. <br> By asking who, what, why, where, when, and how over a single verse, the Holy Spirit can speak to us through the written Word because the Holy Spirit is the Author of the Word (2 Peter 1:21).<br>  I thought of His humanity, the suffering that He saw, the lost sheep of Israel who would have nothing to do with Him, the depravity of mankind, the compassion that He had. <br> What must Jesus have been thinking (meditating) on when He wept?</p>
<h3>
Grieving God's Heart
</h3>
<p>
It must grieve the heart of God to know that many will be called but few will be chosen.  Many have heard of Jesus but few will trust in Him. <br> The path to destruction is broad but the way of life is narrow and winding and few are they that find it.  That makes me want to weep too. <br> For all those who refuse to believe, those who will not come to saving faith, I meditate on their eternal, future fate.  That makes me want to share the gospel all the more.  I want to be about my Father’s business in rescuing the perishing.  The Bible is full of God’s desire that no one will perish <br>(2 Peter 3:9, 1 Tim 2:4, Ezek 18:23).</p>
<p>  
Meditate on what breaks God’s heart and your heart will be broken too. <br> Meditate on the Word of God and you will hide it in your heart (memorise it).  Then you will have the Word in you to be able to resist when temptation comes.  You can meditate on God’s desire to save those who are headed for the Great White Throne Judgement (Rev 21).</p>
<h3>
Choose a Verse to Meditate On  
</h3>
<p>
I choose John 11:35 (“Jesus wept“).  I wanted to align my heart with Jesus’ heart.<br>  
Take one line from the Word of God for example:<br>

<font color= "blue">But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him.<br> (1 John 2:5)</font> <br>By this we know that we are in Him  and memorise it, think about it, ponder it, reflect upon it, and then God<font color= "blue"> “will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success” (Josh 1:8)</font>. <br> That is a promise from God.  There is nothing more certain in all the universe than a promise of God.  Just meditate on that for a while.</p>
