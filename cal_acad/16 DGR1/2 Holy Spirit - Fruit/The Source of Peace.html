The Source of Peace
</h1>
<h3>
Peace
</h3>
<p>
The Holy Spirit is our only true Source of peace ... the absence of inner conflict. His Presence brings peace. When we obey His instructions a calmness will enter our spirit. The greatest warfare of our life is the Holy Spirit versus our flesh and self. When we permit the leadership of the Holy Spirit in our life, we will enter the most remarkable and unforgettable season of calm and inner peace we could imagine.</p>
<p>
Man cannot give this peace. Popularity does not create this kind of peace. Wealth cannot produce this peace. Psychiatrists cannot produce this kind of peace. A loving mate does not produce this kind of peace.</p>
<p>
Uncommon peace is a gift from an uncommon God.<br><font color= "blue"> "And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus." (Phil 4:7)</font><br>
The Holy Spirit helps us to develop the mind of Christ.<br> <font color= "blue">For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace (Rom 8:6)</font><br>
<font color= "blue">
To whom He said, "This is the rest with which You may cause the weary to rest," and, "This is the refreshing"; (Isa 28:12)</font></p>
<h3>
Discernment
</h3>
<p>
The Holy Spirit will give us discernment regarding our friendships. <br>Fault-finding words create a climate of conflict, anger and cynicism ... from such we are to turn away. <br><font color= "blue">"But avoid foolish and ignorant disputes, knowing that they generate strife. <br>And a servant of the Lord must not quarrel but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient, in humility correcting those who are in opposition, if God perhaps will grant them repentance, so that they may know the truth," (2 Tim 2:23-25).</font> When the Holy Spirit is in leadership, we will discern these people quickly.</p>
<p>
You are a door or a wall. You can become a wall against cynicism, discouragement and pessimism. Or you can be a door of entry for others to walk into joy. Sometimes it is necessary to become a wall against things that are unholy, unrighteous, and that bring unhappiness, yet, Oh, how I want to become the Door for the presence of God to enter.</p>
<p>
The Holy Spirit will give you the courage and strength to withdraw from the company of foolish people. This increases your peace. <br>Pessimism and despondency can come through the words of one person. <br>We are told to stay away from fools. (Prov 14:7)</p>
<h3>
Three Ways the Holy Spirit Uses the Word of God in our Life
</h3>
<p>
1. The Word of God is the instrument of peace for the Holy Spirit to use.<br> <font color= "blue">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Great peace have those who love Your law, And nothing causes them to &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;stumble. (Psa 119:165).</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
2. You will keep him in perfect peace, Whose mind is stayed on You, Because he &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;trusts in You. (Isa 26:3).</font> <br>
<font color= "blue">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"How beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace, who &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;bring glad tidings of good things!" (Rom 10:15)</font></p>
<p>
3. We must embrace the Word of God as the most effective instrument for &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;change.<br> <font color= "blue">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work (2 Tim 3:16-17).</font></p>
<h3>
Five signs that someone is not Word-conscious
</h3>
<p>
1. They discuss their warfare, instead of the promise of victory.<br>
2. They discuss their doubts, instead of their faith in God.<br>
3. Their focus in their enemy, instead of their Comforter.<br>
4. If the Word of God were dominating their mind, it would dominate their &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;mouth.<br>
5. If the Word dominated their mind, it would influence their conduct and &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;behaviour.</p>
<p>
The Holy Spirit inspired the Scriptures. He affects our words. He uses the Word of God to bring peace into our hearts. Don’t throw it away, Don’t treat it lightly.</p>
<h3>
Four tips for creating a peaceful climate
</h3>
<p>
1. Recognise that conflict is the trap for distraction. Don’t sacrifice a marriage or &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;friendship because of one sentence spoken in a day. That is demonic, <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is satanic. It is not even logical. The purpose was to break our focus on &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;things that are worthy. (Phil 4:7-8)</p>
<p>
2. We determine our own focus. It is our own personal decision. Whatever we &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;are feeling is produced by our focus. We must stop and take time to change &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;our focus</p>
<p>
3. Pay any price to protect your focus on right things. <br><font color= "blue">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If your hand causes you to sin,... (Mark 9:43,45; Isa 26:3)</font> </p>
<p>
4. The Holy Spirit is our true Source of love. Love is the most powerful force on &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;earth ...<br> <font color= "blue">&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;who was given to us. (Rom 5:5)</font></p>
