Servant of the Lord

<h3>
Purchased by Christ
</h3>
<p>
Christians we are slaves of Christ because He purchased and redeemed our souls. What a joy it is to be His slave! What an honour to follow and serve the Truth- the Lover of our souls who washed our crimson sin stained hearts white as snow. It is so very satisfying to serve the King of Kings who gives to all their life and breath and who sustains our being and upholds all things by the word of His power? To submit to the One who gives rest to those who come to Him weary from their labour? Is servitude to Him not much more appealing than becoming slaves to our own fleshly addictions or selfish ambitions, the world system, or the devil’s desires- which only lead to destruction and despair?</p>
<h3>
Slaves of Christ 
</h3>
<p>
The more we understand and walk in our true identity as the redeemed, the more we are able to choose truth and life when conflict arises- the more we can walk in the reality that we are accepted by our Father even though we are rejected by all others- the more we can respond with love and graciousness even though we are ridiculed and belittled. </p>
<p>
This kind of love in action flows from the soul practising the presence of God and walking after the Spirit which indwells all whom Christ has bought with His blood. The Lord’s ambassador is called not to quarrel but to teach- to use wisdom in the communication of Christ’s revelation so that the medium is engaging and effective. Kindness, patience, and gentleness are the fruits of the Spirit that should be released when we are wronged or contradicted. </p>
<h3>
Communicating the Truth
</h3>
<p>
When we communicate the Truth verbally and “correct those in opposition,” our character is the package from which the words come and will either validate or discredit our message. In our witness there is a synergy between God and man in that we announce the grace of God through our words and actions, and God grants the unbeliever the repentance which leads to the knowledge of the truth. May we seek to become more effective instruments of God grace and truth.</p>
