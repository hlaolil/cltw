"But I tell you who hear me: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, (Luke 6:27)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">
But -</font></p>
<p> 
A strong adversative conjunction. In the verses previous to this text Jesus had been addressing the unregenerate. In Luke 6:27-28 He returns to the regenerate.

I Tell You -</font></p>
<p>  
Denotes the divine authority of the God-man.

Notice the tense of the verbs and participles in Luke 6:27 to 30, present tense, continuous, and constant action, both on the part of the hearer and the enemy.

Love -</font></p>
<p>  
Means  "be constantly living."  The word <i>agape</i> in Greek and its cognates is always a love of the will, of deliberate purpose. The word <i>fileo</i>  means the love of affection, a spontaneous love. Friends love each other spontaneously. Most married people do the same. But agape steps in where <i>fileo</i> fails. Scripture never tell us to <i>fileo</i> one another. But it does constantly speak of agape.

Enemy - </font></p>
<p> 
This is a personal, not a political or national enemy. This verse cannot be used by conscientious objectors who refuse to go to war because the Lord says:  "Love your enemies."  The text is speaking of the kingdom of grace, not the kingdom of power.

Love Your Enemies - </font></p>
<p> 
This is basic to all that follows. The next three clauses in verses Luke 6:27-28 expand on this first injunction. Note the grade of intensity regarding of both parties in Luke 6:27 and 28: the more intense the hatred becomes the more intense the love should become.

The second clause reads literally:  "Be constantly doing good to those who are constantly hating you."</p>

Luke 6:28 bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.

At this point look at Romans 12:14; 1 Corinthians 4:12; Luke 23:34; Acts 7:59-60.

The first clause reads:  "Constantly be blessing the ones who are constantly cursing you."  This reminds us of Jesus on the cross or of Stephen just before he was stoned to death.


Luke 6:35 But love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them without expecting to get anything back. Then your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High, because he is kind to the ungrateful and wicked.

BUT - Some translate  "No."  Others  "instead."  It is meant to show the utter contrast between the regenerate and the unregenerate. Jesus summarizes by using the verbs already used in verses 32,33 and 34. We suggest that the five (Greek) buts in this verse mean respectively:  "Namely, for example, and thus, namely, as well as."

Here again we have  "reward"  as we did in the Gospel for Epiphany VI. It means  "reward of grace."  That it is eschatological, in the future, is proved by the verb.

SONS OF THE MOST HIGH - God's kindness and goodness extend to every detail of creation, preservation, and providence. God is kind to the ungracious and wicked in society. That's the way we should be. We should be like our Father in heaven.

This verse does not forbid lending money at interest. It is not speaking about the kingdom of power. Loan companies are not sinning against this verse unless they practice usury and sharp practices. Jesus is speaking about people in the kingdom of grace who are to be generous towards others, as God Himself is.

The second clause reads:  "Constantly pray for those who are insulting you."  This requires the love of the will, of deliberate purpose, the attitude of the regenerate man. What we are told to do is very foreign to the flesh, the old Adam. We think of Romans 12:21:  "Do not be conquered by the evil but do conquer evil by means of the good."



Luke 6:37  "Do not judge, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.

There is an  "and"  at the beginning of this verse in Greek. It introduces a new thought. The kind of judging which Jesus prohibits is the condemning kind which proceeds from hate, not love.

We have two prohibitions and two emphatic promises. The second prohibition and promise explain the first. This passage by no means contradicts John 7:24; 1 Corinthians 5:12; 1 John 4:1; Matthew 18:17-18; and John 20:23. Jesus is saying  "Don't play God or others will play God with you."

The two prohibitions and promises are followed by a command and a promise. Most of our versions translate  "Forgive and you will be forgiven."  One translation says:  "and God will forgive you."  This same translation renders the promises in verse 37 with  "God will not judge you"  and  "God will not condemn you."  Though that is true we think this translation puts too much of a limitation on these three promises. Jesus is saying three times in verse 37 that the kindness which we show others will be shown by others to us.


Luke 6:38 Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over, will be poured into your lap. For with the measure you use, it will be measured to you."

The command and promise at the beginning of this verse cover every aspect of human need, be that physical, mental, or spiritual. God wants His children to be generous.

GOOD MEASURE - The metaphor from the market aptly illustrates the generosity and blessing of the Christian.  "Good measure"  is explained by the three adjectival participles which follow. The first two are perfect passive, denoting lasting results. The third is a present middle participle. If we are generous to others they bless us like a merchant who sells a measure of barley which has been pressed down, well shaken, and running over. The buyer picks up the fringe of his garment and the seller pours the barley into his lap in this way.

WILL BE GIVEN - The subject is other people whom God uses to bless the generous Christian. Of course, God is the cause, but He uses other people to carry out His promise.
