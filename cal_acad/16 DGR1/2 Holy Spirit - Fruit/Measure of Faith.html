Measure of Faith
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
For I say, through the grace given to me, to everyone who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, as God has dealt to each one a measure of faith. (Rom 12:3)</font></p>
<p>
Right away, two facts are apparent about the “measure of faith”: first, it is the standard by which we correctly appraise ourselves, and, second, it is meted out by God. Because each believer receives his measure of faith by God’s allotment, we are prevented from thinking of ourselves “more highly” than we ought.</p>
<p>
Looking at the broader context of Rom 12:3, we notice there is something else given by God. The grace of God is mentioned as a gift to Paul in the same verse, and that same grace is mentioned as a gift to all believers:<br> <font color= "blue">“Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us,” <br>(Rom 12:6)</font><br>
So, immediately following his discussion of the measure of faith, Paul speaks of the gifts of the Spirit: prophesying, serving, teaching, encouraging, giving, leading, and showing mercy.</p>
<p>
Recognising that our measure of faith comes from God prevents pride and encourages “sober judgement.” Each of us should recognise the limits of his or her own gifts. At the same time, we must acknowledge the gifts that others possess and that each believer is divinely placed into Christ as a vital and functioning part of His spiritual Body (Rom 12:4–8; cf. 1 Cor 12:27).<br> No member should consider himself or herself as superior to any other but should instead recognise that God has placed us just where He wants us with the gifts He has chosen for us (1 Cor 12:11).</p>
<p>
God has given to each a “measure of faith” to use for Him. This “faith” is the gift from which all the other gifts flow. Faith is the first gift we receive (for justification), and faith is the gift that brings the other gifts of the Spirit into our lives. When a person is born again, God gives him gifts as a new member of the family of God. We receive the gifts according to the measure that God has given us, and we exercise the gifts according to the same measure of faith.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“But to each one of us grace was given according to the measure of Christ's gift.” (Eph 4:7)</font>. <br>God deals to everyone his portion. Not everyone receives all the gifts, nor is the same gift given to everyone in the same measure. Our sovereign God distributes each gracious gift according to the measure of faith that He has bestowed on us.</p>
