The Result of Faith

But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labour is not in vain in the Lord. (1 Cor 15:57-58)</font></p></p>

So many Christians experience pyrrhic victories (victories offset by staggering losses.) that masquerade for the spiritual victories that are won through the Lord Jesus. Pyrrhic victories are those which are won through efforts of our flesh that may win a few battles but end up costing us so much that we eventually lose the greater wars. The following are some of the ways that we can transform our fleshly experiences into Christ centred victories that are enabled by the power of the word, the Spirit and the fellowship of godly believers.</p>
<p>
1. Exchange the volatility of our emotions with the stability that is found in worship of God, Christ and the Holy Spirit. When the resurrected Christ appeared to the disciples the Bible teaches, "When the disciples saw Him they worshipped Him but some doubted. Jesus said, "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations..." (Matt 28:17-20) True worship ascribes the entirety of our heart, soul, strength and mind’s love to the Lord for all that is He without reservations. That total allegiance gives one stability in the midst of the volatility of life’s emotional ups and downs.</p>
<p>
2. Exchange our temporary human victories with the eternal sense of victory that is given through confident trust, reliance and adherence to the Lord Jesus who fights and wins every battle. Too many people are waging battles that are just not worth fighting. They are arguing about trivial things that are extensions of their egos. James says it best,<font color= "blue"> "Where do wars and fights come from among you? Do they not come from your desires for pleasure that war in your members? You lust and do not have. You murder and covet and cannot obtain. You fight and war." (James 4:1-2)</font> Ask God to give you the discretionary equanimity of spirit, soul and body so you do not get stressed out over the things in life that really do not matter from an eternal perspective.</p>
<p>
3. Exchange vindictiveness with a forgiving, merciful and compassionate heart. So many of us want things to be fair so we tend to react when we are cut off in traffic or slighted in any way. Instead of over-reacting or over-dramatically responding to irritations let us allow the Lord to help us remember to be as forgiving, merciful and slow to lose our cool as God is with us. (Eph 4:28-32) Forgiving one another just as God in Christ has forgiven you.</p>
<p>
4. Exchange any victim mentality with the fact you are more than a conqueror through Him who loves you. Neither tribulation, persecutions, famine or nakedness will be able to separate you from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus. (Rom 8:31-35) God is for you so you are never powerless, forsaken or victimised by circumstances.</p>
<p>
5. Exchange any vitriolic critical and caustic attitudes with an upbeat, confident and courage disposition. God told Joshua as he was to take the Israelities into the promise land. "Be strong and courageous and act. Do not fear or be dismayed for the Lord God goes with you. He will not fail you or forsake you until all the work of the house of God is finished." (Josh 1:9) There is so much sarcasm, cynicism, and disbelief today in our world that it is endemic. Replace this with the confident expectation that God will do what HE says He will do and act on that conviction of anticipation. HEb 11:1 - Faith is assurance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen.

6. Exchange vapid or insipid-indifferent attitudes toward spiritual matters with a willingness to engage in spiritual warfare. Paul wrote, "We battle not against flesh and blood but against spiritual forces in the heavenly realms." We are in a battle and therefore we will either emerge as victors or the vanquished. Choose which end you want to experience.</p>
<p>
7. Exchange vulgarity with purity. So much of the reason that people are not living victorious Christian lives is that they are not pure in heart. Jesus said, <font color= "blue">"Blessed are the pure in heart for they will see God." (Matt 5:8)</font> Without a clear conscience, a holiness of mind, heart and emotions we are inhibited in our fellowship with God and limited in our ability to experience His empowering, enabling and enlightenment. </p>
<p>
8. Exchange venomous language with edifying speech. By criticizing, complaining and speaking negatively about others we find ourselves polluted by our own judgemental attitudes. If we want to experience good we need to put away our critical speech pattern, gossiping and criticizing and put on edifying patterns of as Paul wrote about, <font color= "blue">"but, speaking the truth in love,</font> (Practising, holding it forth) <font color= "blue">may grow up in all things into Him who is the head--Christ--" (Eph 4:15)</font> </p>
<p>
9. Exchange vision-less living with the visions that God has with goals of what is planned for your life. The Lord has special plans, goals and objectives for you that only are given to you as you envision what is ahead. Quit looking back at the past. Stop comparing yourself with others. Ask God to show you the next door of opportunity He has for you to serve in so that you can keep on asking, seeking and knocking until He opens the best avenues of ministry for you. (Matt 7:7)</p>
<p>
10. Exchange any vapidity or lack of interest with vivaciousness, vitality and vigour. Those who are full of enthusiasm are going to be reproduced and multiplied by the Lord. <font color= "blue">"Then out of them shall proceed thanksgiving And the voice of those who make merry; I will multiply them, and they shall not diminish; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small." (Jer 30:19)</font></p>
<p>
11. Exchange vitiating thinking that tries to debase others or opportunities with a vibrant testimony of the great things God is up to around the world. Read and involve yourself with the modern missionary movement to get a glimpse of what God is doing around the world in completing the building of His church. (Matt 16:18) When we are so busy in the expansion of His church we minimise our own sense of uselessness, depression or self-pity.</p>
<p>
12. Exchange the sudden or unexpected changes in life with the certainties of God, His promises and His projects. The Lord always has something special for you to do everyday if you just listen to His word and voice. He does not want us to have to live with the uncertainties of circumstances or be caught off guard by the setbacks of life. The Lord is our refuge and strength. A very present help in the time of trouble.</p>
