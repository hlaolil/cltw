   <h1>
Fruit in its Season
</h1>
<p>
If there is one thing we learn from Jesus in His Word it is that He expects us to be fruitful in life. Think of how He dealt with the fig tree when He found no fruit on it. He saw leaves and was attracted to the tree because of His hunger for fruit. You see when a fig tree displays leaves it should also have some fruit. The cursed tree ended up with an external display of beauty in its leaves, but with no substance of fruit.</p>
<p>
As Believers we cannot afford to only display our beautiful leaves to be attractive to those around us without producing spiritual fruit to impact their lives. A cursed life is a fruitless life and a fruitless life is a cursed life.
Let's look at a few key verses about fruitfulness before we explore ways to be fruitful and the different fruits our lives produce.</p>
<p>
And Hezekiah, said the Lord <font color= "blue">This shall be a sign to you: You shall eat this year such as grows of itself, And in the second year what springs from the same; Also in the third year sow and reap, Plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them. And the remnant who have escaped of the house of Judah Shall again take root downward, And bear fruit upward. (2 Kings 19:29-30)</font><br>
Our roots downward and our fruit upward! What a great concept. What are you growing in? Where have you attached your roots in? If it is the Word of God, you have a foundation that will last forever and you will never have to endure the trauma of being replanted or uprooted.</p>
<h3>
Walking in the Ways of God
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
He shall be like a tree Planted by the rivers of water, That brings forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also shall not wither; And whatever he does shall prosper. (Psa 1:3)</font><br>
This Psalm speaks of a person who walks in the ways of God, delights in His word and refuses to associate with evil and wrongdoers. Such a person can expect to produce fruit in every season, being a blessing to many.</p>
<h3>
A Righteous and Fruitful Life
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
The righteous shall flourish like a palm tree, He shall grow like a cedar in Lebanon. Those who are planted in the house of the Lord Shall flourish in the courts of our God. They shall still bear fruit in old age; They shall be fresh and flourishing, (Psa 92:12-14)</font><br>
Look at the promise of fruitfulness. God assures us of a fruitful life when we live an uncompromisingly righteous life. A life that pleases God and causes us to be able to stand blameless before Him. </p>
<h3>
Good Fruit or Bad Fruit
</h3>
<p>
You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thorn bushes or figs from thistles? Even so, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Therefore by their fruits you will know them. (Matt 7:16-20)<br>

Here we learn that there are basically only two types of fruit. Good fruit or Bad fruit. Good fruit is edible, bad inedible. Good fruit is worthy of admiration, bad fruit is despised or worthless. We must make it our life purpose to produce fruit worthy of God's admiration; fruit that will identify us as worthy, admirable and sound.</p>
