   <h1>
God's Book of Life
</h1>
<p>
The Bible speaks of a book in heaven that lists the names of all the people who will inherit eternal life. Will your name be included in the Book of Life?</p>
<h3>
The Book of Life
</h3>
<p>
God reveals through His servants, the prophets, that He has a very special book. This is currently an open book containing a registry of names.<br> God deems very precious the individuals whose names are being recorded in it.</p>
<p>
This unique book was not made with human hands. Instead, it exists in the heavenly realm.<br> It belongs to Jesus Christ and is called <font color= "blue">“the Lamb’s Book of Life” (Rev 21:27).</font> <br>To have one’s name written in this book means that one is considered righteous before God and will inherit eternal life provided he or she remains faithful to the end (Rev 3:5). <br>To have one’s name blotted out of this book signifies a fate of eternal death (Rev 3:5; 20:15).</p>
<p>
The first mention of this Book of Life is when Moses offered to have his name erased from it. Speaking to God, Moses said,<br><font color= "blue"> “Oh, these people have committed a great sin, and have made for themselves a god of gold! Yet now, if You will forgive their sin—but if not, I pray, blot me out of Your book which You have written” <br> And the Lord said to Moses,  “Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot him out of My book” (Ex 32:31-33).</font></p> 
<p>
As noble as Moses’ intentions may have been to protect his fellow Israelites from God’s wrath, God will not negotiate with people’s salvation in this way.</p>
<h3>
Who is Currently in the Book of Life?
</h3>
<p>
The Book of Life contains the names of those who have been spiritually converted and who have dedicated their lives to the service of God.<br> Like other servants of God, Moses understood that his name was already written in the Book of Life (Ex 32:31-32).</p>
<p>
Jesus said that Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and the prophets will be in the Kingdom of God, so their names are certainly in the Book of Life (Luke 13:28). <br>Jesus further told His disciples to <font color= "blue">“rejoice because your names are written in heaven” (Luke 10:20).</font><br> The apostle Paul wrote a letter citing the names of a few faithful brethren alive at the time <font color= "blue">“whose names are in the Book of Life” (Phil 4:3).</font></p>
<p>
What members of the true Church of God have in common with the patriarchs and prophets of old is that they all share the same gift of the Holy Spirit (1 Peter 1:10-12; 2 Peter 1:21). Having God’s Holy Spirit is the key to being granted eternal life in the Kingdom of God (Rom 8:9,11). Those who will be in God’s Kingdom will have their names in the Book of Life (Mal 3:16-17).</p>
<h3>
Can a Name be Erased from the Book of Life?
</h3>
<p>
God was very clear that a person’s name can be removed from the Book of Life: “Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot him out of My book” (Ex 32:33).</p>
<p>
At the end of the book of Revelation, a warning stands as a guard defending God’s truth.<br> <font color= "blue">“For I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book:<br> If anyone adds to these things, God will add to him the plagues that are written in this book; and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part from the Book of Life,” (Rev 22:18-19).</font></p>
<p>
In the last days, there will be a global resurgence of a false religious system. God says this system of worship of a man will be synonymous with worshipping Satan the devil (Rev 13:4). <br>The deception will be so great that <font color= "blue">“All who dwell on the earth will worship him, whose names have not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world” (Rev 13:8).</font></p>
<p>
Only those who resist participating in this system of worship will be rewarded for their victory over Satan (Rev 15:2; Rev 17:8; Rev 20:4). </p>
<h3>
A Promise to the Faithful
</h3>
<p>
The prophet Daniel, while being given a vision of “a time of trouble” at the end of the age, was told: <font color= "blue">“At that time your people shall be delivered, every one who is found written in the book [of life]” (Dan 12:1).</font></p>
<p>
The apostle John was given a vision even farther into the future of “the great city, the holy Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God” (Rev 21:10). <br>It was revealed to John that <font color= "blue">“there shall by no means enter it [the holy city] anything that defiles, or causes an abomination or a lie, but only those who are written in the Lamb’s Book of Life” (Rev 21:27).</font></p>
<p>
The prophet Malachi was given a message of correction and warning for God’s wayward people, the Israelites. God still loved His people, though they had strayed from His laws; but He now demanded honour, faithfulness and obedience from them.</p>
<p>
God then inspired Malachi to share a wonderful promise of hope. God would grant to those who fear Him the reward of eternal life in the Kingdom of God. They would be identified in a registry called a <font color= "blue">“book of remembrance” <br>(Mal 3:16).</font></p>
<p>
This “book of remembrance” is a reference to the Book of Life. <br>As Malachi noted: <font color= "blue">“Then those who feared the Lord spoke to one another, and the Lord listened and heard them; so a book of remembrance was written before Him for those who fear the Lord and who meditate on His name. "They shall be Mine," says the Lord of hosts, "On the day that I make them My jewels. And I will spare them as a man spares his own son who serves him” (Mal 3:16-17).</font></p>
<p>
This fear of the Lord that Malachi spoke of is a healthy respect and love for God. To fear God and to keep His commandments is the whole duty of man<br> (Eccl 12:13).<br> To love God is to keep His commandments (1 John 2:5; 1 John 5:3).<br>

God remembers the faithful deeds of “those who fear the Lord and who meditate on His name” (Mal 3:16). <br>This means their godly conversations with each other are being listened to intently, and every act of kindness and mercy is being noted <br>(Matt 10:42; Matt 25:34-40).<br> To those who care for the needs of others, we’re reminded,<br> <font color= "blue">“For God is not unjust to forget your work and labour of love which you have shown toward His name” (Heb 6:10).</font></p>
<h3>
What else does God keep a record of?
</h3>
<p>
Even the struggles of trying to live a godly life against hardship and temptation appear to be recorded in heaven. David, who was destined to be Israel’s next king, asked God to remember his suffering during a low point in his life when he was surrounded by enemies. He said, <font color= "blue">“You number my wanderings; put my tears into Your bottle; are they not in Your book?” (Psa 56:8).</font></p>
<p>
Nehemiah may have been making reference to a heavenly record as he prayed:<font color= "blue"> “Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for its services!” (Neh 13:14).</font></p>
<h3>
Is there also a record of men’s sins in heaven?
</h3>
<p>
The simple truth is that we will be judged for what we do <br>(Isa 66:15-16; Rom 1:18-32).<br> Solomon said, <font color= "blue">“For God will bring every work into judgement, including every secret thing, whether good or evil” (Eccl 12:14).</font></p>
<p>
Jesus Christ, after His return and during His judgement of mankind, <br><font color= "blue">“will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the counsels of the hearts” (1 Cor 4:5).</font> <br>While here on earth, Jesus also said,<font color= "blue"> “I say to you that for every idle word men may speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgement. For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned” <br>(Matt 12:36-37).</font></p>
<p>
While the scriptures we have just seen do not necessarily imply that there is a written record of men’s sins, the reality is that God knows everything we do. And because God has perfect memory, there is indeed a record.</p>
<p>
Thankfully, there is a way to have our sins blotted out and remembered no more by God (Heb 8:12). This forgiveness is made possible by Jesus Christ paying our death penalty for us, if we repent and accept it.</p>
<p>
Through the prophet Ezekiel, God says, <font color= "blue">“Again, when a wicked man turns away from the wickedness which he committed, and does what is lawful and right, he preserves himself alive. Because he considers and turns away from all the transgressions which he committed, he shall surely live; he shall not die” (Ezek 18:27-28).</font><br> When a wicked man repents of his sins, <font color= "blue">“none of the transgressions which he has committed shall be remembered against him;” (Ezek 18:22).</font></p>
<p>
When people repent, God also declares through the prophet Isaiah: <br><font color= "blue">“I, even I, am He who blots out your transgressions for My own sake; and I will not remember your sins” (Isa 43:25). </font></p>
<h3>
The basis of God’s judgement
</h3>
<p>
The prophet Daniel, describing the vision he was given of God’s throne room where judgement takes place, said: <font color= "blue">“I watched till thrones were put in place, and the Ancient of Days was seated. ... The court was seated, and the books were opened” (Dan 7:9-10). </font></p> 
<p>
The apostle John was also given a vision of God’s future judgement.<br> John recounted: <font color= "blue">“Then I saw a great white throne and Him who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away. And there was found no place for them. And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were opened” (Rev 20:11-12).</font></p>
<p>
These books represent the books of the Bible, which contain God’s law—the standard by which everyone’s deeds will be judged.<br><font color= "blue"> “And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books” (Rev 20:12).</font></p>
<p>
John, still recounting his vision, then explained that an additional book was opened: <font color= "blue">“And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life” (Rev 20:12).</font> When the process of judgement is finished, the record of names will be examined and <font color= "blue">“anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire” (Rev 20:15).</font></p>
<h3>
When is a name entered into the Book of Life?
</h3>
<p>
The apostle Paul explains that the initial step toward salvation is for a person to believe the gospel message of Jesus Christ. <br><font color= "blue">“In Him you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of His glory.” (Eph 1:13-14).</font></p>
<p>
Upon receiving the gift of the Holy Spirit, at that moment a person is begotten into the spiritual family of God (Rom 8:14,16). <br>When a believer receives the Holy Spirit, the seal of promise, he or she joins the <font color= "blue">“general assembly and church of the first born who are registered in heaven” (Heb 12:23).</font><br> Thus, a person’s name is entered into the Book of Life.</p>
<h3>
What Must I Do to have My Name in the Book of Life?
</h3>
<p>
For God to record our names in the Book of Life, we must repent of our sins, be baptised and become spiritually converted. Water baptism symbolises one’s lifelong commitment to follow God’s way of life (Acts 2:38).</p>
<p>
Jesus told His followers, <font color= "blue">“Do not labour for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give you, because God the Father has set His seal on Him” (John 6:27)</font>.</p> 
<h3>
Why is it so important for us to do this?
</h3>
<p>
Jesus Christ declares,<font color= "blue"> “He who overcomes shall be clothed in white garments, and I will not blot out his name from the Book of Life; but I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels” (Rev 3:5).</font></p>
