<h1>
Abundant Reasons to be Joyful
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
And my soul shall be joyful in the Lord; It shall rejoice in His salvation. (Psa 5:11)</font></p>
<p>
I went to Scripture and looked up verses with the words “be joyful” in them. I found a lot of reasons for which we can be joyful. 
Let me first say that there are many reasons people don’t allow themselves to experience joy. Guilt and fear are two of the most prominent.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Guilt </font></p>
<p>
Guilt that you are experiencing joy and others aren’t, guilt that you’re taking the time to experience joy when you should be doing any of a number of things, or guilt over anything the enemy can convince you to feel guilty about.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Fear</font></p>
<p>
Fear that the joy will be taken away from you, fear that you have made a mistake (and therefore shouldn’t be relaxing in the joy), fear of living in general, or fear of anything the enemy can convince you to be afraid of.</p>
<p>
My goal is to remind us that God wants us to be joyful and to identify some specific things that He’s told us to be joyful about. I want to open the door for the Holy Spirit to remove the guilt or fear that keeps you from experiencing joy, as well as open some new doors to rooms in which perhaps you’ve never experienced joy before.</p>
<h3>
Be Joyful for Holidays and Take Joy in Them
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
And you shall rejoice (be joyful) in your feast, you and your son and your daughter, your male servant and your female servant and the Levite, the stranger and the fatherless and the widow, who are within your gates. (Deut 16:14)</font></p>
<p>
It may seem that I’m stretching this a bit, and perhaps I am, but in the Old Testament God established and commanded a series of feasts throughout the year. They had different purposes, but many were simply celebrations of God’s goodness and provision. Most Christians do not celebrate the Old Testament feasts. (I do not but think it would be a fascinating year if I were to incorporate all the feasts – and I’m guessing I would greatly benefit from it. If this interests you, the best approach may be to find a Messianic congregation to become a part of. Don’t be shy – go for it!)</p>
<p>
I think we can extend the spirit of the feasts to recognise that God has given us times of rest and rejoicing and that we should be joyful in those. As I read about the Old Testament feasts, they seem like holy vacations that the Israelites were commanded to take each year! Vacations! Holidays! And they were commanded to take them! And they were to rejoice in them.</p>
<p>
Incorporating the Lord in your vacations is a reason that you can enjoy your vacations! Take them responsibly (that is, don’t spend the money for your next mortgage payment on them), then enjoy them.</p>
<h3>
Be Joyful in Your Success
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Seven days you shall keep a sacred feast to the Lord your God in the place which the Lord chooses, because the Lord your God will bless you in all your produce and in all the work of your hands, so that you surely rejoice.(be joyful). (Deut 16:15)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
When you eat the labour of your hands, You shall be happy, (joyful) and it shall be well with you. (Psa 128:2)</font></p>
<p>
We’re not to be prideful when we’ve completed a job well and when we are successful, but we are to take joy in it. “God will bless ... the labour of your hands, You shall be happy,(joyful).” God blesses us for many reasons, but this verse tells us that one of those reasons is to increase our enjoyment of life – to increase our joy. So don’t feel guilty about your success. Enjoy it!</p>
<h3>
Experience the Joy of God’s Protection and His Refuge
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
But let all those rejoice who put their trust in You; let them ever shout for joy, because You defend them; let those also who love Your name be joyful in You. (Psa 5:11)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">
Be Joyful</font></p>
<p>
We can have joy because we know – we know – that God is our defender. When it seems like the world is against us, we can be joyful in God – in the One who knows us best and defends. In the one who says “that one is mine.”</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Adventurous</font></p>
<p>
We can look for the adventure because God will work it out. He will come riding in on a white horse and save us. What joy that will be! That’s the shouting kind of joy.</p>
<p>
In the meantime, He gives us a place of refuge and we can rejoice in that. That’s the quiet, inner peace kind of joy.</p>
<h3>
Be Joyful in God’s Salvation
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
And my soul shall be joyful in the Lord; it shall rejoice in His salvation. (Psa 35:9)</font></p>
<p>
So the ransomed of the Lord shall return, and come to Zion with singing, with everlasting joy on their heads. They shall obtain joy and gladness; sorrow and sighing shall flee away. (Isa 51:11)</p>
<p>
God has saved you. Rejoice in His love and in your salvation. Don’t just celebrate, meditate on it so that you experience the joy of freedom that is possible through the salvation He has given you. We have been ransomed! We were slaves to sin. Christ paid the ransom to set us free. That’s how much He loves us. Rejoice! Be joyful!</p>
<h3>
Be Joyful in Knowing that God will Rescue You
</h3>
<p>
The Lord says: <font color= "blue">“I will take from them the voice of mirth and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the lamp.” (Jer 25:10)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Thus says the Lord: Again there shall be heard in this place--of which you say, "It is desolate, without man and without beast"--in the cities of Judah, in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man and without inhabitant and without beast, the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of those who will say: "Praise the Lord of hosts, For the Lord is good, For His mercy endures forever"-- and of those who will bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the Lord. For I will cause the captives of the land to return as at the first," says the Lord. (Jer 33:10-11)</font></p>
<p>
No matter what you’ve done or where you have been exiled – God will rescue you because you are His. No matter how dark your situation seems today, God will turn it around. Sorrow may last for the night, but joy comes in the morning – and there’s always a morning after every night.</p>
<h3>
Be Joyful Knowing that You Are Loved
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
The Lord your God in your midst, The Mighty One, will save; He will rejoice over you with gladness, He will quiet you with His love, He will rejoice over you with singing. (Zeph 3:17)</font></p>
<p>
Not only can we take joy in God’s salvation – or rather, the salvation He has given us – we can be joyful knowing the joy He takes in us. We sing in worship to the Lord. We sing for joy when life is good. God sings for joy about us! Wow! The Creator of the Universe rejoices over me. I am blown away by that.</p>
<h3>
Be Joyful Because You Have Hope
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing steadfastly in prayer; (Rom 12:12)</font></p>
<p
There is no such thing as hopeless for the one who Trusts in Christ. We always have hope. Always. And that’s reason enough to rejoice. As I said earlier, we can experience life as an adventure, watching with anticipation to see how God is going to come through in the current challenge ... and the next one and the next one.</p>
<p>
Joy need not be an elusive thing for the believer. When our hearts, minds and spirits are focused on these things, we can have joy – abundant joy. It’s part of the “abundant life” package God has given us.</p>
