Biblical Love

<p><font color= "blue">
And this I pray, that your love may abound still more and more in knowledge and all discernment, that you may approve the things that are excellent, that you may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ, being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.

<h3>
1. Biblical Love for God and Others
</h3>
<p>
This is the Supreme Virtue of the Christian Life.</p>
<p>
You may have assumed that Paul’s prayer is directed toward love of the brethren, but please notice that he does not state the object of love. Of course, love for God and love for others can’t be separated. As John puts it, <font color= "blue">“God is love, and the one who abides in love abides in God, and God in him ... And this commandment we have from Him: that he who loves God must love his brother also” (1 John 4:16,21)</font>. Love is not optional for the believer. It is bound up with the very essence of being a Christian. As John again puts it, <font color= "blue">“We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. He who does not love his brother abides in death” (1 John 3:14)</font>. Jesus summed up the Law with the two commandments, to love God and to love our neighbour (Matt 22:37-40). If you are not growing in love for God and others, you’re not growing.</p>
<p>
But, what is biblical love? The word “love” conjures up warm, fuzzy, sentimental feelings of being nice all the time to everyone. But we must define love by Scripture, not by our cultural notions. Biblical love is never in opposition to truth, but rather is based on and is in line with truth. Biblical love is a caring, self-sacrificing commitment that seeks the highest good of the one loved. In our text, Paul says that ...</p>
<p><font size="+1">
A. Biblical Love is Linked to Knowledge and Discernment</font></p>
<p>
We think of love as being undiscriminating. Discrimination and love seem like opposites. But Paul prays that the Philippians would grow in discerning love. Love is not blind. It does not close its eyes to reality. It is not a feeling devoid of content. Biblical love is related to true knowledge and it operates with careful discernment.</p>
<p>
“True knowledge” is a single Greek word (<i>epignosis</i>) that refers to intensive or deep spiritual knowledge. (See Eph 1:17; 4:13). Since God cannot be known except as He has revealed Himself, such true knowledge of God can only be obtained through His Word. Since God Himself is Love, to grow in the true knowledge of God is to grow to understand what true love is.</p>
<p>
This true knowledge of God as revealed in His Word is essential if you want to grow in love. We can’t know love by looking at our culture. We can only know what love looks like by studying the character of God, especially as revealed in the Lord Jesus Christ, God in human flesh. Was Jesus always syrupy and sweet with people? Read Matt 23, where He lays into the Pharisees! Notice how He sometimes confronts the disciples. Yet He is the epitome of love!
Confronting sin is not an evidence of a lack of love! Biblical love is based on the true knowledge of God.</p>
<p>
Also, biblical love is bound up with discernment. <font color= "blue">But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, that is, those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.” (Heb 5:14)</font> Since biblical love is both holy and based on truth, we cannot love properly if we lack discernment.
Those who think of faith as the abandonment of reason cannot be truly discerning. Irrationality and discernment are polar opposites. When Paul prayed that the Philippians love would “abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment” (Phil 1:9), he was affirming the rationality of true faith. He also meant to suggest that knowledge and discernment necessarily go hand in hand with genuine spiritual growth.</p>
<p>
Biblical faith, therefore, is rational. It is reasonable. It is intelligent. It makes good sense. And spiritual truth is meant to be rationally contemplated, examined logically, studied, analysed, and employed as the only reliable basis for making wise judgements. That process is precisely what Scripture calls discernment.</p>
<p>
The mood today is that if you are critical of anyone’s doctrine or personal life, no matter how unbiblical it may be, you are not loving and you are arrogant to judge this person. Jesus’ words, <font color= "blue">“Judge not, that you be not judged” (Matt 7:1)</font> are wrenched out of context and misapplied. If people would just keep reading, Jesus goes on to say,<font color= "blue"> “Do not give what is holy to dogs, and do not cast your pearls before swine” (Matt 7:6)</font>. How can you determine if someone is a dog or swine if you don’t make discerning judgements? A few verses later He warns us to beware of false prophets who come as wolves in sheep’s clothing (Matt 7:15). It takes a discerning sheep to see that this isn’t a fellow-sheep whom we need to embrace, but a ravenous wolf we need to avoid!</p>
<p>
Thus biblical love cannot be divorced from the true knowledge of God and from the discernment between truth and error and right and wrong that comes from a careful knowledge of Scripture.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
B. We must Continually Grow in Biblical Love </font></p>
<p>
The Philippians were a loving people, as evidenced in their relationship with Paul. But he prayed that their love would abound still more and more. No one can say that they have arrived at perfect love for God and others.</p>
<p>
This means that biblical love is something we need to work at constantly. Did you give any thought to it this week? Husbands, are you working at loving your wife? Wives, are you working at loving your husband? Parents, are you working at loving your Children? Children, are you working at loving your parents? Singles, are you working at loving your room mate? It’s a lifelong process.</p>
<p>
One place to start is to study the many biblical references of the word “love.” Jot down on a card and memorise Paul’s great description of love: <font color= "blue">“Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.” (1 Cor 13:4-7)</font></p>
<p>
At the heart of biblical love is self-sacrifice. Christ loved us and gave Himself for us (Gal 2:20; Eph 5:25; John 3:16). So many sincere Christians have been sucked into the popular false teaching that we must build our own and our children’s self-esteem. But this is diametrically opposed to Paul’s prayer, that we may abound in biblical love, because self-sacrifice and self-esteem (or self-love) are opposites.</p>
<p>
Don’t misunderstand! To say that we should not build our children’s self-esteem is not to say that we should be unloving toward them. In fact, we should esteem our children and others more highly than we do ourselves (Phil 2:3-4). We should encourage them and give them proper affirmation, which is a part of biblical love. But the goal of such behaviour is not to build their self-esteem, but rather to model Christ and encourage our kids to be like Him. If our children see us denying self to please our Lord, they will want to follow and serve Him by laying down their lives out of love for Him and for others. If our focus is to help our kids build their self-esteem, we’re encouraging the inborn selfishness that dominates every fallen human heart.</p>
<p>
Thus the heart of Paul’s prayer is for us to grow in the supreme virtue of discerning love.</p>
<h3>
2. Biblical love results in godly living that gives glory to God.
</h3>
<p><font size="+1">
A. Godly Living Involves Proper Priorities</font></p>
<p>
Phil 1:10-11 are the result of verse 9 (“so that”). There are five aspects of godly living mentioned here:</p>
<p>
What is vital is that you focus your life on loving God and others based on true knowledge and discernment. If that is at the centre of your life, everything else will fall into its proper place.
<p><font size="+1">
B. Godly Living Involves Integrity</font></p>
<p>
“... that you may be sincere and without offence ....” (Phil 1:10) These words do not imply perfection, which no one, including Paul, attains in this life (Phil 3:13). Rather, the words mean to live with integrity. To be sincere means to be pure, unmixed, without hypocrisy. To be blameless means to walk without stumbling. Paul used the word “blameless” to describe his own conscience before God and men (Acts 24:16). Since God looks on the heart, to be sincere and blameless means to live openly before God, judging sin on the thought level. It means that you don’t live a double life, putting on a good front around the church folks, but living another way when you’re alone or with your family.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
C. Godly Living Involves Living in Light of Christ’s Coming</font></p>
<p>
“... till the day of Christ; ...” (Phil 1:10) The Christian who is growing in discerning love is living in light of Christ’s soon coming, when we all must stand before Him. If you’re living for personal happiness or fulfilment in this life, you will live for self and will not live in love for God and others. But if you realise that today you could be face to face with Christ, it motivates you to godly living, to self-sacrificing love.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
D. Godly Living Involves Bearing Fruit Through Jesus Christ</font></p>
<p>
“... being filled with the fruits of righteousness which are by Jesus Christ, ...” (Phil 1:11)
The instant we trust in Christ as Saviour, God imputes His righteousness to our account, so that we have right standing with Him. But the Christian life is a process of growing in righteous character and deeds. As the word “fruit” implies, this is a process, not something instantaneous. The word picture also implies that it is the life of Christ working in and through us that produces the fruit (John 15:1-6). As we grow in the true knowledge of God and in discernment through His Word, the fruit of the Spirit, whose first characteristic is love, is produced in us. We will become <font color= "blue">“zealous for good works” (Titus 2:14)</font>. The final result will be:
<p><font size="+1">
E. Godly Living Results in Glory and Praise to God</font></p>
<p>
“... to the glory and praise of God.” (Phil 1:11) As we abound in discerning love, which leads to godly character and good deeds, God will be exalted in and through us, so that both we and others will praise Him for His grace and power. The ultimate goal of the Christian life is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever. He is glorified (made to look good as He truly is) when His people abound in discerning love.</p>
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Pursue love, (1 Cor 14:1)</font>, “Make love your aim.” Is your love for God and others abounding “still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment”? Is your growing love leading to godliness through proper priorities, integrity, living in light of Christ’s coming, and bearing the fruit of righteousness, so that your life results in glory and praise to God? Let’s all apply Paul’s prayer first to ourselves, and then let’s pray it for one another. If we grow in love rooted in true knowledge and discernment, we will avoid the winds of false doctrine that are blowing so many off course in our day.</p>
