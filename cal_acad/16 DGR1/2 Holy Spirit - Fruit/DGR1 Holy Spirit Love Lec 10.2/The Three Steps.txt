But also for this very reason, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, to virtue knowledge, to knowledge self-control, (2 Peter 1:5-6)</font></p>
<h3>
Faith, Virtue, Knowledge and Self Control
</h3>
<p><font size="+1">
The Foundation of Faith</font></p> 
<p>
A strong conviction and trust in both God and Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
The Quality of Virtue</font></p> 
<p>
A desire for excellence striving to become all that Jesus desires of them.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Increasing in Knowledge</font></p> 
<p>
Gaining awareness and understanding through study and experience especially regarding the will of God and the way of salvation.</p>

Add Self Control as Knowledge Increases</font></p> 
<p>
What good is it to grow in knowledge of good and evil if we do not have the ability to make proper use of such knowledge?</p>
<h3>
A Closer Look at Self Control
</h3>
<p>
But what exactly is self-control, and how do we add it to our lives? <br>
Controlling the self is a natural component to growing in the knowledge of Jesus.<br>
As faith without works is dead, so faith without self-control is meaningless.
Striving for excellence (virtue) is not possible without the discipline of self-control.
Increasing in knowledge is nothing but an academic exercise, unless we are able to apply that knowledge by exercising self control.</p>
<p>
As we seek to develop self-control in our lives remember the promise of our baptism (a new life free from sin's dominion!)<br>
Walk after the Spirit (by setting your mind on the things of the Spirit)<br>
Be empowered by the Spirit through the Word of God and prayer.</p>
<p>
Be careful to properly channel what self-control is developed and not follow human traditions, nor seek the praise of men but humbly pursue godliness, and serve our fellow man.</p>
<p>
In this way we develop that Christ-like character, coming to truly know
Him who through self-control offered Himself in service to His Father
and for sinners.</p>
