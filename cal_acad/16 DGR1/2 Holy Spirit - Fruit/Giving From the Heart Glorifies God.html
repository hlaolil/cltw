   <h1>
Giving From the Heart Glorifies God
</h1>
<h3>
Joyful Giving 
</h3>
<p>
In giving, we turn our financial efforts into service and devotion to God by constantly working in service to Him by the sweat of our brow.</p>
<p>
Throughout 2 Cor 8-9, Paul focuses upon the heart of individual givers. <br>In 2 Cor 8:2 Paul notes the joy of the Macedonians as they gave beyond their ability. It seems an oxymoron that people could be in joyful affliction, but so was the case in Macedonia. Although they were afflicted in giving beyond their ability, it was joy for them to give. Because, they were giving from a true and honest heart by first giving themselves to the Lord (2 Cor 8:5). So we have the very beginning of Paul's teaching focused upon giving with the proper attitude.</p>
<h3>
Grudging or Generous Giver
</h3>
<p>
In 2 Cor 9:5, Paul points out two types of givers. There are those who give out of generosity and those who give out of grudging obligation. As you would guess, the one giving grudgingly is the one who gives the bare minimum. <br>Of this Paul says: <font color= "blue">"He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver."<br> (2 Cor 9:6-7)</font></p>
<p>
Paul compares the grudging giver to the one who sows sparingly.<br> Everyone knows that we cannot reap if we do not sow. So it is with God and spiritual sowing. The one who sows little reaps little, and the one who sows much reaps much. Therefore, we should be liberal givers so that we are bountiful in our work for the Lord. But, God is not necessarily promising earthly wealth for those who give liberally and cheerfully.</p>
<h3>
Beware the Prosperity Message
</h3>
<p>
Although prosperity is a popular message preached today, notice that those who are "generous" givers will not necessarily be rich in earthly wealth.<br> Some have preached this message in order to entice people to give more money. <br><font color= "blue">"And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, have an abundance for every good work." (2 Cor 9:8)</font> Paul says that we will have the sufficiency for the work - not abundant wealth to eat, drink, and be merry.</p>
<p>
If we determine to do the work, God will supply the means, but the means is not to be squandered on luxurious living. God supplies us richly so that we may be liberal givers.<br> Paul goes on to say: <font color= "blue">"Now may He who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for food, supply and multiply the seed you have sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness, while you are enriched in everything for all liberality, which causes thanksgiving through us to God." (2 Cor 9:10-11) </font><br> For what reason are we richly given the seed? So that we may give (sow) liberally. And, what is the result of our liberality in giving (sowing)? <br>It causes thanksgiving to be given to God.</p>
<p>
This message is far from the "sow a seed - out of debt - diamond ring" message being shouted from pulpits across this country. It is more popular to tell people how rich they will be if they give to God than to tell them that God may give to them so that they may again, unselfishly, give liberally.</p>
<h3>
Thanking and Glorifying God
</h3>
<p>
Paul concludes 2 Cor 9 and says: <font color= "blue">"For the administration of this service not only supplies the needs of the saints, but also is abounding through many thanksgiving to God, while, through the proof of this ministry, they glorify God for the obedience of your confessing to the gospel of Christ, and for your liberal sharing with them and all men, and by their prayer for you, who long for you because of the exceeding grace of God in you. Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!" (2 Cor 9:12-15)</font></p>
<p>
Notice that Paul prescribes the gift to needy saints as coming from God. Why? Because God is the one who gives to the giver. Therefore, the giver is really God. When it comes to giving, you can look at it like this: It is not how much I decide to give back to the Lord, but how much I decide to keep.<br> You see, whether you give it or keep it, it is all the Lord's. The Lord has given to us richly, should we not richly give so that He is glorified through thanksgiving? <br> This may also be why: <font color= "blue">"God loves a cheerful giver." (2 Cor 9:7)</font></p>
