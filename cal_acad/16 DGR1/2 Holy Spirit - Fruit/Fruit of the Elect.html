Fruit of the Elect
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercies, kindness, ... (Col 3:12)</font></p>
<h3>
Chosen by God
</h3>
<p>
Here we find the radical results of being chosen by God.
Our nature prior to salvation when we walked in the old man could not be described as holy in any way shape or form. We had walked according to the course of this world as sons of disobedience indulging the desires of our flesh and mind (Eph 2:2-3). <br>In addition, we were objects of His wrath (Rom 1:18; 2:5). But now we are "holy and beloved" because God has chosen us by virtue of His own love and set us apart for Himself.<br>
No wonder then that Paul says that our salvation is:<br> <font color= "blue">"to the praise of the glory of His grace, by which He made us accepted in the Beloved." (Eph 1:6)</font><br> Because we who are disciples of Jesus Christ are chosen by God, holy and beloved, we are to live accordingly in a new manner exhibiting a holy character.
<h3>
Putting on Christian Virtues
</h3>
<p>
Just as He commanded that we are to "put on the new man" so we are to also "put
on" these Christian virtues. Just as we can be identified by the clothes we
wear, so we should be identified by the new man and his holy character.<br> Paul
then goes on to list some of the virtues that should be part of the Christian’s
character – kindness, compassion etc.<br> These are a contrast to the characteristics of the old man.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Kindness </font></p>
<p>
Kindness is a characteristic that will exhibit itself in action. It is the desire to do what is upright and good toward others. Kindness is a characteristic of God that has been clearly displayed to mankind and according to Rom 2:4 should
lead to man’s repentance. It includes not only His general provision to man, but
more importantly His provision of salvation through Jesus (Eph 2:7; Titus 3:4) and especially its application to us who are Gentiles (Rom 11:22).</p>
<p>
Kindness considers others and does good to them which is the opposite of malice
which desires the harm and results in harsh treatment of others.<br> 
Gal 5:22 uses the same word stating that this kindness is a fruit of the Spirit. The more closely we walk according to God’s Spirit, the more this characteristic will mark our lives.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Compassion </font></p>
<p>
For the Christian, compassion is not to be a trained, cognitive response to those in need as an obligation, but one by which we are moved emotionally with pity toward those in need resulting in actions of mercy and grace.<br> It is a reflection of God Himself for the same word is used to describe Him as <font color= "blue">"the Father of mercies" (compassion) (2 Cor 1:3)</font> and in Rom 12:1 it is used to refer to all that God has done in redeeming us from our sins.<br> We have been saved because God has had compassion on us.</p>
<p>
Jesus often felt this emotion of compassion for the multitudes because they were distressed (Matt 9:36) or sick (Matt 14:14) or hungry (Matt 15:32). <br>Jesus had pity on humanity and responded as a shepherd toward sheep without a shepherd. We are to follow that example by having sympathy and empathy for others which in turn motivates us to action. Such actions of compassion should be the normal response of those who are saved. <br><font color= "blue">"But whoever has this world's goods, and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his heart from him, how does the love of God abide in him?" (1 John 3:17)</font>.</p>
<p>
Compassion is a response to those in need while kindness is toward everyone.
