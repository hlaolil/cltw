<h3>
Works of Flesh and Fruit of the Spirit
</h3>
<p>
Paul calls the vices in Gal 5,<font color= "blue"> "works of the flesh," (Gal 5:19)</font> Keep in mind that "flesh" does not mean "body," as though our bodies were the root cause of our sins. There are some sins listed here that don't come from our bodies (e.g., strife, enmity, jealousy, anger, envy, etc.). Flesh is the old ego that is self-reliant and does not delight to yield to any authority or depend on any mercy. It craves the sensation of self-generated power and loves the praise of men. We have seen earlier that in its conservative form it produces legalismâ€”keeping rules by its own power for its own glory. But here Paul opens the lens so we see that the flesh also (in its more liberal form) produces grossly immoral attitudes and acts: "sexual immorality, licentiousness, idolatry, sorcery," and hateful, harmful tendencies: "enmity, strife, jealousy, anger," etc. The flesh is the proud and unsubmissive root of depravity in every human heart which exalts itself subtly through proud, self-reliant morality, or flaunts itself blatantly through self-assertive, authority-despising immorality.</p>
<p>
Now why does Paul call the products of our flesh "works" and the products of God's Spirit through us "fruit"? Until recently I would have said: because works implies effort and fruit implies effortlessness, and God's will is that we experience love, joy, and peace effortlessly. But then I noticed that many of the "works of the flesh" are just as effortless for a natural person as the fruit of the Spirit is for the spiritual person. For example, anger requires no effort: cross a natural man and red anger flows as naturally as blood from a wound. Or envy: no one has to work to be envious. It just blisters up like old paint under paint stripper. So I doubt that Paul called these vices "works" because they require effort to produce. A bad tree bears bad fruit effortlessly.</p>
<h3>
The Flesh wants Satisfaction
</h3>
<p>
Nor would it be accurate to say that these vices are called works because they are done to earn wages, like moral people often hope to earn rewards. Strife, jealousy, and anger are not generally calculated to earn anyone's approval. But let's be careful here. Yes, the spontaneous reactions of strife, jealousy, anger, envy are not in themselves performed to earn anything; but are they not an emotional attempt to settle accounts because we didn't get what we thought we had earned or deserved? Envy, for example, does not aim to merit anything, but it is the product of a heart that thinks it merits more than it is getting. </p>
<p>
Jealousy is not calculated to earn any pay, but it is the product of a heart that expected to be paid what went to another. In other words, the kind of heart that produces these vices is a heart that thinks of itself as creditor and everyone else as its debtors. The flesh is convinced of its own merit and expects God and man and nature to pay dues by giving the satisfaction it desires. When these payments of satisfaction are not made, the flesh reacts the way it does not to earn anything, but because it feels that it already had earned what it didn't get.</p>
<p>
The flesh knows nothing of grace. It doesn't think of its satisfactions as free gifts from a merciful God. It thinks of them as debts which it deserves to be paid. This is why all its products should be called "works." Even though jealousy and anger and envy come out of the flesh just as spontaneously and effortlessly as fruit out of a tree, the tree only thinks in terms of merit and pay and reaction for no pay. And so everything it produces is flavoured by the mentality of merit and is called "works."</p>
<h3>
Rely on the Mercy of Christ
</h3>
<p>
But the mentality behind the fruit of the Spirit is the mentality of faith depending upon grace. People who bear the fruit of the Spirit know they are worthy only of condemnation. They know that the only pay they can earn is the wrath of God. Therefore, they have turned away from self-reliance and look only to mercy in Christ who <font color= "blue">"loved me and gave Himself for me." (Gal 2:20)</font>. They do not expect anyone to be their debtor because of their worth. Any satisfaction will be a free gift of grace. They bank on the mercy of God and entrust themselves to His Spirit for help. And out of that mentality of faith depending on grace grows not "works" but "fruit": love, joy, peace, patience, kindness ...</p>
<p>
So even in the names that Paul has given to his lists of vices and virtues, he helps us see that the issue is not the outward activities of life but the kind of heart that produces our outer life. Paul assumes that some powerful battle has been fought and won in the deep territory of our soul. That's the meaning of Gal 2:20, "Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires."</p>
