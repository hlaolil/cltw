Self Control

Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; (1 Cor 13:4)</font></p>

Many people believe it is okay to get angry, and even resort to violence, if provoked beyond reason. If you subscribe to this theory, please understand that you will never be able to respond in any way other than with anger. You yell and become angry and this becomes the automatic choice you exercise and then you can forget all about developing the self-control you wanted to develop!</p>
<p>
The only way you will be even be able to rein in your temper is if you believe that it is possible to keep your anger under control, and then determinedly try your best to do so. This is not going to be easy (I should know; I used to have a hair trigger temper), but it is possible (I haven't got more than mildly irritated in nearly a year!).</p>
<p>
Here are a few things to keep in mind. Some are practical pieces of advice; some are merely to egg you on to trying harder! They all worked for me.</p>
<p>
1. There is an enemy out there - a defeated enemy at that - who doesn't want you to do anything God wants you to do. Do you really want him to get the better of you?</p>
<p>
2. The same enemy knows how you react to certain situations. He knows which buttons he needs to press to make you blow your top. Change the way you react when the buttons are pressed. He gets confused.</p>
<p> 
3. Remember that love (love is patient; it is not easily angered: cf 1 Cor. 13:4-5) doesn't depend on the actions of somebody else. So if you decide to love somebody, you have to do so regardless of what that person does.</p>
<p>
4. Do you claim to be full of the Holy Spirit? Self control is one of the fruit of the Holy Spirit. If you don't have self-control, you cannot claim to be full of the Spirit.</p>
<p>
Pray! While all the above helped me gain control over my temper, what really got me victory was time spent with God in prayer. The same goes for just about everything else, actually.</p>
<p>
Until such time that you do learn to control your temper, you could leave the house, and go for a long drive. This is something that you could possibly exercise. There is a couple who exercised this option to great success, recently celebrating 50 years of married life. They used to go out for a drive every time they found themselves getting angry with each other. I believe they spent more time in the car than in the house!</p>
