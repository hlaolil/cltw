   <h1>
Jesus' Priority Mission <br>The Resurrection 
</h1>
<p>
Everything is turned on its head since that spectacular morning.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“This Jesus God has raised up, of which we are all witnesses.” (Acts 2:32)</font>.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“... Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures,”<br> (1 Cor 15:3-4)</font>. 
<p><font color= "blue">
“that which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.” (1 John 1:3)</font>.</p>
<p>
“Already by the time of Paul, our earliest written records, the resurrection of Jesus is not just a single detached article of faith. It is woven into the very structure of Christian life and thought,” explains New Testament scholar N.T. Wright. <br>
“He who would preach the Gospel must go directly to preaching the resurrection of Christ,” said Martin Luther, “for this is the chief part of our faith.”</p>
<p>
The Resurrection of Jesus Christ means that He is the Lord of All Things:<br> even of death itself. He will not be bound by human boundary.<br> Sin and death cannot undo Him; Jesus undoes them (Acts 2:24; Col 2:15, etc.).</p>
<p>
The Resurrection means that nothing, ever, can separate the believer from the love of God in Jesus Christ (Rom 8:35ff.).</p>
<p><font color= "blue"> He ... has begotten us again to a living hope  (1 Peter 1:3)</font>.</p>
<p>
Nothing in all creation <font color= "blue">“shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Rom 8:39) </font>.</p>
<p>
The Resurrection means that the great sacrifice of Calvary is unambiguously complete: <br>Lord Jesus Christ <font color= "blue">"who was delivered up because of our offences, and was raised because of our justification” (Rom 4:25)</font>.<br> 
By the blood of the cross and the shattered tomb, we are made a new creation. Death itself is finally and forever destroyed (cf. 1 Cor 15:26).</p>
<p>
The Resurrection of Jesus Christ means mission, too.<br> <font color= "blue">“He died for all, so that those who live might live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died  and rose again” (2 Cor 5:15)</font>. </p>
<p>
<font color= "blue">“Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.” (Rom 6:4)</font>.</p>
<p>
The New Testament describes a resurrection life that awaits us at the end of time – and invites us to participate today. <br>N.T. Wright puts it this way: “Christians are called to work together with God to implement what was launched at Easter and so to anticipate the new world God will make eventually.” Nothing “level headed” here! The untamed message of Jesus’ resurrection sweeps us into Jesus’ mission, if we receive the message in faith. “Easter is not the celebration of a past event. The alleluia is not for what was; Easter proclaims a beginning which has already decided the remotest future. The Resurrection means that the beginning of glory has already started.”</p>
<p>
In his letter to the Philippians, the Apostle Paul confesses,<br> <font color= "blue">“that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death,” (Phil 3:10)</font>. <br>
I can identify. “Faith knows the power that [Christ’s] coming back to life gives ...”. I want to know it, too.</p>
<p>
This is the power that transforms lives, stands at the heart of our faith, seals our life-with-God, and enables our service. The resurrection of Jesus puts everything else into perspective. He cannot remain a simple historical curiosity, since that spectacular morning. He is our ever-living Lord.</p>
