<h1>
The Priority Missions of Jesus
</h1>
<p>
1. Jesus was sent by God in the power of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>
2. Jesus was sent to proclaim the good news.</p>
<p>
3. Jesus was sent to enact the good news.</p>
<p>
4. Jesus was sent to form a community of the good news.</p>
<p>
5. Jesus was sent to consummate the good news through His death and resurrection.</p>
<p>
By dying upon the cross for our sin and by rising from the dead in victory over sin, Jesus fully activated the good news. We can now be reconciled to God and live forever in unbroken fellowship with God. We can begin already to experience the new creation, even as we wait for the complete renewal still to come (2 Cor 5:16-21). Yet the once-never-to-be-repeated work of Jesus in dying and rising did not finish His ministry on earth. That ministry was to continue through the community of His disciples whom Jesus sent to continue His work.</p>
<p>
The writer of Acts of the Apostles, the same Luke who wrote the third gospel, begins his account of the early Christian mission in a most curious way:
<font color= "blue">The former account I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, until the day in which He was taken up, after He through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom He had chosen (Acts 1:1-2)</font>.</p>
<p>
Luke says that his first book, the Gospel of Luke, shows us “all that Jesus began both to do and teach.” Acts of the Apostles, therefore, must be the chronicle of that which Jesus continued to do and teach through those who believed in Him and were filled with His Spirit. The book of Acts of the Apostles might better be named: The Acts of Jesus through his Apostles.</p>
<p>
The end of Matthew’s Gospel makes this same point in different language. As the disciples of Jesus gathered around Him after His Resurrection, He said:
<font color= "blue"></font>"All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age." Amen. (Matt 28:18-20)</p>
<p>
Jesus sent his inner core of disciples into the world for the purpose of making more disciples. These new followers of Jesus would not only believe in Him, but also would obey all the commands Jesus gave to His first disciples. The second generation of disciples were to make more disciples, who would make more disciples, who would make more disciples, and so forth until all nations are filled with disciples of Jesus.</p>
<p> 
We who believe in Jesus are somewhere down this chain of discipleship, perhaps a hundred links or more from the original command to make disciples. As disciples or apprentices of Jesus, we are called to do that which He commanded to His original team, such as:<br>
<font color= "blue">
And as you go, preach, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.' Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out demons. Freely you have received, freely give. (Matt 10:7-8)</font>.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another. (John 13:34)</font>.</p>
<p>
But, whereas the first disciples were to minister only among their fellow Jews while Jesus was on earth, after the resurrection they – and we – are sent out to all nations. Jesus explained this sending quite succinctly:<font color= "blue"> “As the Father has sent me, I also send you” (John 20:21)</font>.</p>
<p>
We who follow Jesus are a sent people, even as Jesus was sent into the world by His Heavenly Father. We are a community sent on a mission together: to keep on doing the ministry of Jesus so that all people and all creation might experience the reconciliation of God. God has designed the church of Jesus Christ to be a “missional” fellowship. The word “mission” comes from the Latin word missio, which means “having been sent.” Since we have been sent to do God’s work, we are a “missional” community together. </p>
