The Purpose of Life

Today Does Matter

<p>
The 33 years that Jesus lived on this earth was lived toward one hour of time: <br><font color= "blue">
But Jesus answered them, saying, "The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified. Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain. He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also. If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honour. "Now My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? 'Father, save Me from this hour'? But for this purpose I came to this hour. Father, glorify Your name." Then a voice came from heaven, saying, "I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.” (John 12:23-28)</font></p>
<p>
Just as the Lord Jesus, we are to live our lives on this earth toward one hour of time. Our hour is the consummation of His hour:</p>

“Therefore you also be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect." (Luke 12:40).</font></p>

“And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to Myself; that where I am you may be also” (John 14:3).</font></p>
<h3>
Your future is the fruit of your Today or Right Now
</h3>
<p>
If you are not focused on and prepared for the coming of Christ today/right now, at this present moment you will not be ready (in position) on that day and hour.

Prepared means to be fit, adjusted, and set in order. To be set in order is to be living a balanced Christian life, which is a life that is lived in remembrance of the price that Jesus paid to redeem our lives from destruction. It is being forever mindful of the greatness of the sacrifice. It is constantly calling to mind our condition when Christ died, remembering that we were enemies of God because of sin, cut off from the life of God, damned and sentenced to hell for eternity. And worst of all we were totally helpless to do anything about it (1 Cor 11:24-26; Isa 53:4, 5, 10; Rom 5:6-8; 2 Cor 5:21; Gal 3:13; Eph 2:11-13).</p>
<p>
In gratitude we are to live a godly life, which means we are to live reverently, loyally, and obediently before God and Man. That includes husbands, wives, children, family, friends and co-workers (Matt 5:16; Titus 2:11-14; 1 Peter 1:13-16; 2:11, 12). We are to, faithfully share-earthly minded in the Lord’s work in a manner that is worthy to be believed.</p>
<p>
Pursuing Jesus, the Holy Spirit, and the souls of men, women, and children should consume our lives (Matt 25:21; 1 Cor 15:58; 2 Cor 5:10; Eph 5:15-16). And lastly we are live expectantly-heavenly minded, preoccupied with, fixated on, watching, waiting, longing, looking for, and loving the Lord’s appearing which is the blessed hope of the believer (Matt 25:13; Luke 2134-36; John 14:1-3; 1 Cor 1:7; Phil 3:20; 1 Thess 4:17; 5:6; 2 Tim 4:8; Titus 2:13; Heb 9:28).</p>
<h3>
A Balanced Christian Life
</h3>
<p>
A balanced Christian life is living the life, working on earth, and watching the sky.<br>

There is no room or time for distractions from the point of our lives in this world. If you are not prepared (fit, adjusted and set in order now, you will not be ready (in position) to be satisfied on that day and hour.<br>

Satisfaction is the fulfilment of a longing. whatever your preoccupation, fixation, and longing is now it will be on that day and hour.<br>

The real question for us all is this: if you knew exactly what day and hour the Lord was to return; how would you be living on that day and hour?</p>
