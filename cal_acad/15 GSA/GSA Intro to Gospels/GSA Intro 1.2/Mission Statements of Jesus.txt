Mission Statements of Jesus
</h1>
<p>
Jesus says a lot about His own mission, especially in the Gospel of John. The church often focuses on its own mission before asking: What was Jesus’ mission, and what does that tell us? That question is important, since the church’s mission derives from Jesus’ mission and the mission of God.
Throughout Gospel of John, Jesus speaks repeatedly about being sent by Father to do Father’s will and work; to accomplish His mission. Over thirty times in John, Jesus speaks of being “sent.” He emphasises that His mission derives from the Father’s mission or will. He speaks more of the Father’s agency than of His own––“I am sent” more than “I have come,” for instance—though He does use phrases like “I came” or “I have come” about a dozen times. Jesus is the sent One—sent to do the work God have Him to do.
What is Jesus’ mission, according to John? Combining Jesus’ many statements (but omitting for the moment Jesus’ important prayer in John 17) yields this composite summary:</p>
 <p><font color= "blue">
He said to them, "I have food to eat of which you do not know." ... "My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work". (John 32,34)</font> <font color= "blue">Jesus said to them, "My Father is always at His work to this very day, and I, too, am working." (John 5:17)</font> <font color= "blue">the works which the Father has given Me to finish--the very works that I do--bear witness of Me, that the Father has sent Me. (John 5:36)</font> <font color= "blue">I have come down from heaven not to do My own will but the will of Him who sent Me. (John 6:38)</font></p>
<p>
Three other very prominent terms in John relating to Jesus’ mission are “will,” “work,” and “works.” A dozen or so times Jesus speaks of the “work” or “works” of God that He was sent to accomplish, and several times of doing the Father’s “will.” Jesus says, <font color= "blue">“I must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; night is coming when no one can work.” (John 9:4)</font>
Elsewhere in the Gospels Jesus of course says many other things about His mission. Most importantly, He ties His mission to the kingdom of God—preaching the kingdom, telling His disciples they should seek first God’s kingdom, and praying, <font color= "blue">“Your kingdom come. Your will be done On earth as it is in heaven.” (Matt 6:10)</font>. Key to fulfilling that goal is making disciples among all nations.</p>
<p>
In short, the Father sent Jesus Christ into the world to “finish the work” the Father gave Him to do (John 4:34; see 5:36, 17:4). For Jesus, “finishing the work” meant His sacrificial death on the cross (“It is finished” in John 19:30) and the eventual total triumph of the kingdom of God (“It is done!” in Rev 21:6). The church lives now between that first and second “It is finished.”</p>
<p>
Jesus’ mission, of course, is accomplished through the presence and agency of the Holy Spirit. It is Trinitarian. Jesus speaks in John of the role the Holy Spirit will play, and many other Scriptures reveal the essential role of the Holy Spirit in bringing Jesus’ mission to completion in the church and in all creation (e.g., Acts 1:8, Rom 8).</p>
<h3>
The Church’s Mission
</h3>
<p>
What does Jesus’ description of His own mission reveal about the mission of the church? Here are four key points:</p>
<p>
Jesus defines our mission. The church’s mission is not her own; it is Jesus’ mission, and the mission of the Trinity. Jesus said,<font color= "blue">“As the Father has sent Me, I also send you” (John 20:21)</font>. This might be called the Gospel of John version of the Great Commission. Christians are called to God’s mission in the world, living and walking in the way of Jesus. Jesus said His disciples would do the “work” and “works” that He did. In fact, <font color= "blue">“and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father.” (John 14:12)</font>. Jesus was concerned above all to do the will and works of Him who sent Him, not His own. So also with us.</p>
<p>
Our ultimate mission as disciples invited to participate in God’s mission is nothing less than the kingdom of God, the reconciliation and restoration of “all things.” It is that grand and comprehensive. Our task as disciples and Christian communities is to discern our specific and strategic part in that larger mission of God. The church as a discerning, disciplining Missional community is essential here. We must never lose sight of the big picture and the grand hope, the larger mission within which we find our particular mission.</p>
<p>
The power to accomplish our mission comes from God—from Jesus and the power of His resurrection and from the filling, empowering, and guidance of the Holy Spirit. The power for mission is life in the Trinity through Christian community. This is what Jesus prays for in John 17.
Like Jesus, we are called to serve others. Faithful leaders are essential in fulfilling God’s mission. But equally essential is that leaders must lead in the way Jesus does, manifesting His spirit and character. Christian leadership certainly is more than servanthood. But it is not less. Phil 2 tells us not only about Jesus but defines our own leadership. <font color= "blue">Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus,” (Phil 2:5)</font> to know and live His mission.</p>
<p>
As Jesus’ Missional community, the church been given the exquisite privilege and high honour of participating, as Jesus’ servants, friends, and co-​​workers, in the mission of the Triune God. We are sent by the Father to be Jesus’ ministers through the work of the Holy Spirit—agents of reconciliation and new creation.</p>
