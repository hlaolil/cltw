   <h1>
The Life of Jesus Christ
</h1>
<h3>
Jesus' Life and Ministry
</h3>
<p>
The primary sources of information about the life and teachings of Jesus Christ are the first four books of the New Testament, which are called the Gospels. Other sources are the many prophecies in the Old Testament about the future Messiah and the New Testament books in which the apostles explain many things about Christ and His teachings.</p>
<p>
Why are there four Gospels instead of just one? First, the Gospels are not purely biographies. Each of the four authors are describing what he considers the most spiritually significant elements of Jesus' life and teachings. <br>Of course, each author was inspired by God through His Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>
There are no real contradictions among the four accounts. The four different perspectives complement each other and help to fill out the whole picture of His perfect life. Therefore, there is harmony, continuity and unity among the four accounts. It's profitable to combine the perspectives into an overall view, but it's also interesting and profitable to focus on one perspective at a time.</p>
<p>
Summarising the particular focus of each author can be challenging, but here is one simplified approach: <br>Matthew announces Jesus as King,<br> Mark presents Him as Servant, <br>Luke focuses on Him as Man and <br>John highlights Him as God.<br> Jesus is our perfect model in each of those roles.</p>
<h3>
The Meanings of Jesus' primary Names and Titles?
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins." (Matt 1:21)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel," which is translated, "God with us." (Matt 1:23)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
He [Andrew] first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, "We have found the Messiah" (which is translated, the Christ). (John 1:41)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"But why do you call Me 'Lord, Lord,' and not do the things which I say?" <br>(Luke 6:46)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, "Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?" (Matt 16:13)</font></p>
<p>
We can understand a lot about Jesus and His mission by understanding His names and titles. Jesus means "saviour." Jesus is derived from the Greek <i>Iesous</i>, which is derived from the Hebrew <i>Yehoshua</i> (from which we get the English name Joshua).</p>
<p>
Jesus truly was and is <font color= "blue">"God with us."</font> He was and is the Son of God and therefore God. He was God in the flesh (Luke 1:35; John 20:28).</p>
<p>
Messiah (from Hebrew <i>mashiach</i>) means "anointed" or "anointed one."<br> Although the specific word appears in the Old Testament only in Dan 9:25-26, many other prophecies promised a Messiah to be sent by God as a deliverer and liberator. Jesus came to earth the first time to deliver us from our sins and will come the second time to deliver us from mortality to immortality.<br> The Greek for Messiah is <i>Christos</i>, from which we get Christ.</p>
<p>
Lord means master. Yet sadly, most who called Him Master would not obey Him as their master.</p>
<p>
Jesus usually referred to Himself as "the Son of Man." The reasons for this have been controversial among scholars, but we can state some likely reasons.<br> Jesus used the definite article—He was the [unique] Son of Man, not a son of man. Jesus wanted all to know that He was human, but a very special human.</p>
<p>
This idiomatic designation sounded reverential, but it was ambiguous in meaning. That may pinpoint why Jesus used it, because for most of His ministry, Jesus avoided referring to Himself as the Son of God or the Messiah or the son of David. He avoided what might sound political or blasphemous because He didn't want to stir up violent opposition prematurely.</p>
<p>
Perhaps Paul was elaborating on this title when he referred to Jesus as: <br><font color= "blue">"the last Adam,"  (1 Cor 15:45)</font> since adam is a Hebrew word for man. <font color= "blue"><br>"The first man [Adam] was of the earth, made of dust; the second Man [Jesus Christ] is the Lord from heaven" (1 Cor 15:47)</font>.</p>
<h3>
Jesus Existed before His human Birth
</h2>
<p><font color= "blue">
In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God ... And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.<br> (John 1:1,14)</font></p>
<h3>
How Jesus was conceived as a human child
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows: After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit. (Matt 1:18)</font></p>
<p>
God the Father used the Holy Spirit to bring about the conception of Jesus in the womb of the Jewish virgin named Mary. <br>For further description, see Matt 1:19-23 and Luke 1:26-35.<br> And for a description of the Word voluntarily giving up His divine power and glory to temporarily become a human being, see Phil 2:6-8.</p>
<h3>
How Jesus began His ministry
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Now Jesus Himself began His ministry at about thirty years of age, (Luke 3:23)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Then Jesus came from Galilee to John [the Baptist] at the Jordan to be baptised by him. (Matt 3:13)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.(Matt 4:1)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Now when Jesus heard that John had been put in prison, He departed to Galilee. (Matt 4:12)</font></p>
<p>
After His baptism and His 40-day fast and temptation by Satan, Jesus returned to Galilee to begin His ministry. Galilee is the area around the Sea of Galilee, north of Jerusalem.</p>
<h3>
The Message that Jesus preached
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Now after John was put in prison, Jesus came to Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God, and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel." (Mark 1:14-15)</font></p>
<p>
The word gospel means "good news." Jesus' message was about God's plan to offer the opportunity for salvation to all humanity, which means eternal life in the Kingdom of God!</p>
<h3>
More remarkable things about Jesus' Ministry
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing all kinds of sickness and all kinds of disease among the people. (Matt 4:23)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Jesus healed people everywhere He went, which reveals several important things. His miracles proved that He was sent by God (Acts 2:22)</font>. </p>
<p>
His miracles showed that He cares for our physical needs as well as our spiritual needs. He loved and respected all people, regardless of gender, race, age or status, demonstrating a degree of love the world had never seen and which serves as a role model for all His future followers (John 13:34-35). <br>He also used miracles to prove that He had the authority to forgive sins and to heal us of our spiritual problems (Matt 9:6).</p>
<h3>
Jesus the Foundation and Head of the Church
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Now, therefore, you are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God, having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone. (Eph 2:19-20)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
And He [Christ] is the head of the body, the church, who is the beginning, the first born from the dead, that in all things He may have the pre-eminence. <br>(Col 1:18)</font></p>
<h3>
Jesus Died and Rose from the Dead exactly as He Foretold
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth." (Matt 12:40)</font></p>
<p>
At the close of Jesus' 3½-year ministry, Jesus willingly allowed Himself to be arrested, tortured, crucified and killed. Jesus' last and most important sign was His prophecy that He would rise from the dead in three days and would be in the tomb exactly three days and three nights (Matt 12:38-40). <br>That was precisely fulfilled!</p>
<p>
He rose from the dead and then left the tomb exactly three full days later. </p>
<p>
After His resurrection Jesus ascended to heaven and returned to appear to His followers several times. Then 40 days after His resurrection, He again ascended to heaven to be at the right hand of God the Father (Acts 1:1-11). <br>As Jesus repeatedly promised, He will one day return to earth (Acts 1:11). <br>And this next time, it will be <font color= "blue">"with great power and glory" (Mark 13:26)</font>.</p>
<h3>
The Main reason for the Life and Death of Jesus Christ?
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life." (John 3:16)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
And truly Jesus did many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book; but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name. (John 20:30-31)</font></p>
<p>
Christ lived His earthly life to set us an example and to build His Church.<br> He died for each and every one of us to pay the penalty of our sins so we can be forgiven of those sins. And He lives again to serve as our Saviour, High Priest and Master (Heb 4:14-15).</p>
<h3>
So what shall we do?
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ." 
Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles,<br> "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
Then Peter said to them, "Repent, and let every one of you be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission [forgiveness] of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit." <br>(Acts 2:36-38)</font></p>
<p>
After Christ's disciples received the Holy Spirit, the apostle Peter preached a sermon about Jesus being the prophesied Christ and how He had been raised from the dead and <font color= "blue">"exalted to the right hand of God" (Acts 2:33)</font>.<br>He told the assembled people, <font color= "blue">"You crucified both Lord and Christ"  (Acts 2:36)</font>. Of course, most of that crowd had no direct part in getting Jesus condemned to death. But we all are guilty indirectly because "all have sinned" and "Christ died for our sins" (Rom 3:23; 1 Cor 15:3).</p>
<p>
The people were convinced that Jesus was <font color= "blue">"both Lord and Christ" (Acts 2:36)</font> and that the guilt for His death lay on everyone, many of them asked, <br>"What shall we do?" They knew they needed to take action.<br> Peter then told them what each person must do to be forgiven of his or her sins and to receive the awesome gift of God's Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38).<br> Peter's instruction to repent and be baptised is just as true today as it was at that time. </p>
