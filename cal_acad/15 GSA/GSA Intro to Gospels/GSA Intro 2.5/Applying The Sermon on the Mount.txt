<h1>
Applying The Sermon on the Mount
</h1>
<p>
Nearly 2,000 years ago, Christ preached a profound sermon showing how converted Christians are to live. How essential is the Sermon on the Mount today?</p>

“Whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I will liken
him to a wise man who built his house on the rock" (Matt 7:24)</font>.</p>
<p>
Christ’s words recorded in Matt chapters 5, 6 and 7 are often called the Sermon on the Mount. The reason for this designation is that Jesus “went up on a mountain” (Matt 5:1) to deliver this message. Apparently, He did this to make it easier for His audience to hear what He was going to say. An abbreviated account of Christ’s Sermon on the Mount is found in Luke 6:20-49. Although there are slight differences between the two Gospel accounts, these passages provide an excellent overview of the subjects Jesus addressed during His earthly ministry.</p>
<p>
The Sermon on the Mount is probably the best-known part of the teaching of Jesus, though arguably it is the least understood, and certainly it is the least obeyed. Because Matthew’s account is more extensive than the one in Luke, we’ll use it to identify key messages that Jesus delivered for His audience in the first century and for us today.</p>
<h3>
Beatitudes and application of the law
</h3>
<p>
Jesus’ sermon begins with a description of those who would be blessed by God. For instance, <font color= "blue">“Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled” (Matt 5:6)</font>.</p>
<p>
The verses beginning with the word “blessed” (Matt 5:3-11) are commonly called “Beatitudes”—meaning a state of supreme happiness. In essence, Jesus is stating that these perspectives would become the mental states of mind for all who would become His disciples.</p> 
<p>
The remainder of the sermon gives more specifics of conversion—how to be a Christian.</p>
<p>
Christ taught that His disciples were to be the salt of the earth and the light of the world. They were commanded, “Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven” (Matt 5:16). Christians examples are to reflect God’s righteousness to the world around them; and by doing so, their actions would shine like lights.</p>
<p>
Following this admonition is a statement that is vital to understand, but often misunderstood: Christ said <font color= "blue"> "Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfil. (Matt 5:17)</font> 
Christ further stated that “Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.” (Matt 5:19).</p>
<p>
What follows is a detailed explanation of the spiritual understanding and application of the 10 Commandments. For example, Christ instructed the audience that it was a spiritual violation of the law against murder to be angry with a person without a cause (Matt 5:22). He also said that men are to avoid adultery, even to the extent of avoiding lusting after women in their hearts (Matt 5:28).<p>
<p>
Just imagine a world in which these two admonitions were obeyed! There would be no road rage or violent verbal abuse. People would try to solve their differences peacefully, and the focus would be on reconciliation. Marriages would be saved, families would thrive and every type of pornography would cease to exist.</p>
<p>
Then Christ gave some of the most difficult instructions to follow: <font color= "blue">“Love your enemies” (Matt 5:44)</font> and <font color= "blue">“be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect” (Matt 5:48)</font>. God loves all peoples. He has deep concern even for those who take His name in vain and reject His very existence. That same level of love He has for all humanity is a love that He wants each person to exhibit toward others.</p>
<p>
Further instruction from the Sermon on the Mount: Prayer and priorities
Within this sermon is a detailed explanation of how to pray. Christ said that converted Christians are not to <font color= "blue">“be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men” (Matt 6:5)</font>. Rather, He told us to <font color= "blue">“go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place” (Matt 6:6)</font>. Also, when we pray, we are not to use <font color= "blue">“vain repetitions” (Matt 6:7)</font>. We are not to just repeat the same words over and over.</p>
<p>
Christ then gave an outline of how we should pray (Matt 6:9-13), praising God in heaven and asking that His Kingdom would come to this earth. We need to ask God for our daily bread (needs), and especially ask Him for forgiveness. After this, Christ admonished everyone to forgive others their sins and offences, so our Heavenly Father will forgive us (Matt 6:14-15).</p>
<p>
Christ also discussed the topic of wealth. Where is our treasure? Which master do we serve? <font color= "blue">“You cannot serve God and Mammon [riches]” (Matt 6:24)</font>. Therefore we are not to worry about things in this life, what we will eat or drink or what we will wear. Our Heavenly Father already knows our needs. Christ also stated that God takes care of the needs of the birds, and He is certainly able to take care of our needs as well (Matt 6:25-32).</p>
<p>
Jesus then clearly showed us what our top priority should be in life: <font color= "blue">“Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you” (Matt 6:33)</font>.</p>
<p>
We are instructed further to ask God for help. As parents know how to give good gifts to their children, so, too, will our Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him (Matt 7:7-11). This is most encouraging!</p>
<h3>
Choices and warnings
</h3>
<p>
As Christ concluded the Sermon on the Mount, He admonished us to make proper choices. We are taught to make choices based on God’s instructions in the Bible and not simply follow the crowd by taking the easy way to live (Matt 7:13-14). We are even warned about false prophets who claim to be Christian, but whose lives don’t reflect God’s values and true conversion. Prophets and ministers are to be evaluated by their fruits (Matt 7:15-20).

Then Christ gave a very serious warning: <font color= "blue">“Not everyone who says to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,” shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven” (Matt 7:21)</font>. Not everyone who claims to be a Christian is one.

We must obey God’s instructions in the Bible, otherwise God will say, <font color= "blue">“I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!” (Matt 7:23)</font>.</p>
<h3>
Still relevant for Christians today
</h3>
<p>
The words of this sermon are as relevant today as they were when Christ spoke them! For <font color= "blue">“whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock: and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, and it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock” (Matt 7:24-25)</font>.</p>
<p>
The question is, will we be like that wise man? Will we take these words to heart from Christ’s Sermon on the Mount? <p>


 you to be like that wise man!
