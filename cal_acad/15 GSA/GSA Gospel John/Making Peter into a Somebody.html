   <h1>
Making Peter into a Somebody
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
So it was, as the multitude pressed about Him to hear the word of God, that He stood by the Lake of Gennesaret, and saw two boats standing by the lake; but the fishermen had gone from them and were washing their nets. Then He got into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. And He sat down and taught the multitudes from the boat. When He had stopped speaking, He said to Simon, “Launch out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch.” But Simon answered and said to Him, “Master, we have toiled all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net.” And when they had done this, they caught a great number of fish, and their net was breaking. So they signalled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they began to sink. When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!” For he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish which they had taken; and so also were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon.<br> And Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid. From now on you will catch men.” So when they had brought their boats to land, they forsook all and followed Him. (Luke 5:1-11)</font> </p>
<h3>
Peter allows Jesus to enter the Boat
</h3>
<p>
Jesus had been preaching along the shore of the lake of Gennesaret (the Sea of Galilee). I imagine the crowd was quite large. His ministry was growing; word had spread about how He had healed those who were sick with various diseases (Luke 4:40). By the time Luke reached chapter 5 in his account of Christ’s earthly ministry, it was obvious that the people were hungry to hear Jesus' preaching and to be near Him. On more than several occasions, I have spoken to large groups of people and watched as they began to move forward.<br> The people in the back leaned in to hear, and in doing so, they pushed against the ones in the front. With His back to the water and the people “pressing” on Him, Jesus had no place to go. Peter the fisherman was also there, listening to some degree as he mended his nets in preparation for going back out on the lake later that evening. It was an odd request, but when Jesus asked the fisherman to allow Him to enter the boat and then to move it off shore a short distance, he agreed. That was Peter’s first step toward obedience.</p>
<h3>
Obedience
</h3>
<p>
The point that I want to make here is that obedience is a process. It is not a gift. Salvation is a gift. God’s grace demonstrated toward us is a gift He gives each one of us when we accept Him as our Saviour. This amazing gift of unconditional love is not something we can work to achieve. Obedience is different, however. God doesn’t necessarily want us to work to achieve it; He wants it to be our first nature. We obey Him because of who He is. After all, how can we halfway obey God?</p>
<p>
Either Peter did what Jesus requested, or he said no. Here Peter said, “Yes,” but notice what else he said: “[Jesus] got into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little way from the land. And He sat down and began teaching the people from the boat. When He had finished speaking, He said to Simon, "Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch."<br> Simon answered and said, "Master, we worked hard all night and caught nothing, but I will do as You say and let down the nets”. <br>In these verses, we are given an outline of obedience.</p>
<h3>
Peter’s Obedience
</h3>
<p>
Many times, the ways of God include specific steps:</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Step One</font></p>
<p> 
Peter was nearby listening to Jesus. The Lord knew that he was there and that he had an empty boat.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Step Two</font></p>
<p>  
Jesus entered Peter’s boat so He would be able to address the crowd better.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Step Three</font></p>
<p> 
Peter listened to Jesus’ request. He responded by explaining that he was completely unsuccessful the night before in his attempt to catch fish. Nevertheless, he obeyed the Lord, raised the sail on his boat, and headed out into deep water.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Step Four</font></p>
<p>  
Peter received the reward of his obedience.</p>
<p>
What would have happened if Peter had said, “No, I spent the entire night out on the water, and if there had been any fish available, I would have caught them”? We can’t dismiss the fact that he was a seasoned fisherman.<br>He knew the waters like we know the backs of our hands. He grew up by the lake, and he understood the components of a productive fishing business—or at least he thought he did.
Here is what God did so that we know He meant business and was involved. The night before, Peter caught nothing—not one single fish. He came in the next morning, he had been up all night pulling and dragging nets around a small, uncomfortable boat. All he wanted to do was clean his nets and go home to take a short nap so he would have the energy to get up and go back out that evening. But Jesus showed up with a crowd of people, and the next thing Peter knew, his boat had become the Savior’s stage. That was alright. He could say, “Yes, You can use my boat while I finish doing what I’m doing.” It was not a difficult decision, but he had to agree to it. <br>Step One and Two were accomplished.</p>
<p>
Step Three was more difficult: not only was he tired, but his friends were close by, watching to see what he would do. When Jesus told Peter to head out into deep water where he would catch a large draw of fish, they probably rolled their eyes. A young Rabbi, whom they were sure knew nothing about fishing, was telling Peter—the master, the ace, the CEO of the shoreline—what to do.
Can’t you imagine John and James looking at each other and thinking, Oh, no, what is Peter going to say? What would you have said? You probably know the ending to the story, so you might be inclined to say, “I would have raised the sail and headed out into the deep.” But would you? Have you, when He has called to you asking that you would obey Him? </p>
<p>
Obedience looks different when He is asking us to do something that personally costs us more than we think we can afford. Scripture doesn’t tell us whether Peter scanned the scene or looked to his buddies for help. It just tells us one thing: he obeyed the Lord and stated, “Master, … I will do as You say and let down the nets.”
I can imagine that silence fell on those who were on the shore as they watched Peter release the anchor, raise his sails, and turn his rudder toward deep water. You may ask, “What motivated him to do this? Is it something that I can experience in my life?” I believe it is, but you must trust God—not pull out your calculator and add up all that you could gain and all that you could lose. <br>This faith comes by hearing God’s voice and responding in pure obedience.</p>
<p>
People have told me, “I just don’t know whether God wants me to do this. <br>It doesn’t make sense.” Going back out to fish during the heat of the morning did not make sense to Peter. No one went fishing then. It was hot, and the fish went to the bottom of the lake—a place where nets could not reach. <br>At night, they were closer to the surface of the water.<br> My obedience today prepares me for my obedience tomorrow, and tomorrow’s prepares me for the next day and for the years to come.</p>
<p>
The fish were not available the night before, but the next day, in the heat of the morning, they were right where God wanted them to be. There are no coincidences with God. Nothing “just” happens. He always has a plan, and that plan reflects His ways. If you want to walk in step with Him, then you will learn how to be obedient. Luke told us that once the nets were down, they began to fill with fish to a point of breaking. Do you realise the miracle that took place? There were no fish the night before, but at a time when none should be present, the waters were teeming. There were so many that Peter had to signal for John and the others to join him. His boat was about to sink, and he did not know what he would do.</p><p> 
All he could utter were these words to the Saviour: “Go away from me Lord, for I am a sinful man”. 
“Amazement had seized him and all his companions because of the catch of fish which they had taken”. Not only was Peter at the hub of this miracle, but others drew near also. Many times when we are obedient, those around us join in the blessing. I’m convinced that none of these men had ever seen so many fish in their nets at one time. The nets were bursting, the boats were about to sink, and Peter fell down on his knees and worshipped the Lord. Here is one truth on which you can stake your life: if Jesus asks you to do something, you know without a doubt that a blessing will follow. <br>Questioning, doubting, calculating—none of these build the faith that He wants you to have and exhibit.
 <h3>
Obeying God
</h3>
<p>
This does not mean that you will never make a mistake. It means that the motivation of your heart, to the best of your ability, is set on obeying God. Remember Abraham left his home at God’s instruction, not knowing where the Lord would lead. Moses went back to Egypt without knowing all that his new role as deliverer would involve. Esther approached the king, not knowing if she would lose her life. Rahab hid the spies who came to view the promised land. Mary heard the angel’s voice and said, “Behold, the [handmaid] of the Lord.” And Peter said, “I will do as You say and let down the nets.” The Christian life requires obedience.
You and I learn obedience. We are not born with the desire to obey God or anyone in authority. It is a learning process. When you were born, you grew to a certain age, and then you began to test how far you could go before your dad or mom gave you a warning. At first, you may have listened when your parents said no, and you stopped what you were doing.</p> 
<p>
But there quickly came a point—even before your first birthday—when you decided that ignoring the word no was not a big deal. But it became a big deal when you continued to ignore their warning and rebuke. If you do not like authority, then you are going to rebel against it. Often children grow up naturally rebelling because their parents do not teach them to obey.<br>If there is a spirit of obedience ruling your life, then you are going to willingly and lovingly choose to be obedient. There are certain rules that we have to obey. Peter did not instantly know to obey Jesus. He did know there was something in Christ’s life, and that something drew him near enough for him to know that this Man was not a typical preacher. Then when his nets filled to overflowing with fish, he dropped to his knees and proclaimed, “Lord!”
<h3>
Beware of Satan's Traps
</h3>
<p>
Here is one of Satan’s traps: God places an opportunity before you, and suddenly you wonder whether He opened the door. You analyse the situation from a human perspective: “If this happens, then I’ll know God is involved.<br>If I get this piece of information, it is His will and I will go forward.” <br>That’s not obedience. If Peter had taken time to go through a mental Rolodex of information about Jesus, he might never have pushed away from shore.<br>The Holy Spirit was the One who brought Peter to the point of obedience. <br>We come to know Jesus as Saviour because His Spirit draws us, and that was exactly what happened with Peter. He knew that the Man who was in his boat was much more than an everyday teacher. He was from God.</p>
<p>
Another way Satan can trip us is by telling us that God leaves some issues up to us. He whispers, “This is not a big deal. It doesn’t matter what you decide at this juncture. If it was something really huge, then God would let you know what you should do.” As hard as it is to believe, young people—who have married and then realised they had many differences—have come to me and said that they did not realise God had a plan in this area. <br>Some are believers, but they never really took a serious amount of time to pray and ask God to give them the right marriage partner. Others may have married unbelievers, and their lives are miserable because suddenly they are unequally yoked (2 Cor 6:14). We could list many, many situations where we have jumped into a situation without asking God what is best.</p> 
<p>
Nothing is insignificant to God. Peter’s journey into obedience began with a simple action. Jesus got into his boat and began teaching God’s truth.<br> Don’t be tempted to think that Peter did not have a choice. He could have asked Jesus to leave, but he didn’t; and his life was totally changed in a matter of moments.</p>
<h3>
God's Rewards 
</h3>
<p>
God wants to fill your life with good things. He has so many rewards, but for the most part, they are not like the rewards of this world. You may achieve a certain level of success, but it will fade. You can earn large sums of money, but not a cent will go with you to heaven. Only God’s rewards are eternal.<br> Only His blessings bring the peace and joy you long to have. <br>The way He operated in Peter’s life is the same way He will operate in your life. <br>You may not be standing on a shoreline cleaning a bunch of nets, but without a doubt there will be a time when He will come to you and say, “Move your boat out into deep water, and let down your nets for a catch.”</p>
<p>
Not only did Peter have to move his boat away from shore, but he had to gather up all his nets—make sure they were folded and ready to go—and then he had to raise his sails so he could go back out on the water. He left the shoreline wondering what would happen next. And when something marvellous happened, he was ready to change occupations. <br>The issue is: What is God’s will for your life? Peter realised what His will was for him, but you must come to a point where you know that you are living the life He has planned for you to live. Once He has made this clear and after you have made the decision to obey Him, the feelings of worry stop, the fretting ends, and the chatter of “what if” fades. You may face feelings of doubt again, however. And if you do, you may have to go back to God and ask Him to encourage your heart and help you recall the verses He gave you that brought finalisation, hope and clarity. </p>
 <p>
How would you categorise your life? Would you say that you are committed to obeying the Lord, but you want to make sure that what you do will be best for you? Or would you say, “I just have this feeling inside every time someone tells me what to do. A wave comes over me, and I can sense this feeling building within that makes me want to say, I know what I’m doing, and I know what is best”? Someone reading this may think, My father was so demanding that I just want to say no to authority no matter what is involved. <br>These are harsh statements, but I have heard ones like them and more.</p>
<p>
The truth is: if you do not come to a conclusion of faith and obedience—it takes both—then your life is going to be outlined by defeat, failure, disappointment, suffering and one wrong decision after another. You must believe in the One whom God has sent to you. <br>The outcome of Peter’s faith was a new line of work—one that had an eternal purpose. Jesus said to him, “Do not fear, from now on you will be catching men”. So when they had brought their boats to shore, they left all behind and followed Him. What an awesome way to live the rest of your life—in the shadow of His constant care, in the light of His truth and eternal glory!</p>
