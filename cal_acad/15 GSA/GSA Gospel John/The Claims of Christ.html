   <h1>
The Claims of Christ
</h1>
<p>
The central question of Christianity, and of history itself, is: Who is 

Jesus Christ? Indeed, the Bible makes it clear that, whether we recognise 

Him now or not, all must one day stand before God and answer that 

question.</p>
<h3>
Jesus Christ the Creator
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was 

God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, 

and without Him nothing was made that was made. ...  And the Word became 

flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only 

begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth" (John 1:1-

3,14)</font>.</p>
<p> 
Paul reminds us: <font color= "blue">"For by Him all things were created 

that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether 

thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created 

through Him and for Him. And He is before all things, and in Him all things 

consist." (Col 1:16-17)</font>.</p>
<p>
Jesus the Word (Greek, logos), the ultimate communication from God, is 

declared to have been, and still is, the Creator of the universe and 

everything in it. When He came to this earth and laid aside His heavenly 

glory He didn't lay aside His power. He was fully human. He suffered 

weariness and fell asleep in a boat. He suffered pain on the cross. He was 

tested in the wilderness but without sin. But at the same time He never 

ceased to be the Creator. How do we know that? Because of the miracles He 

performed to convince people that He was who He claimed to be, the 

Creator.</p>
<h3>
Jesus Did Miracles and Quoted from Genesis
</h3>
<p>
Jesus stilled a storm on the Sea of Galilee (Matt 8:23-27). He stood up in 

a boat, gave an order, and instantly there was a great calm instead of a 

raging storm. Of course the wind and sea had to obey Him instantly, because 

He created them! Jesus turned water into wine (John 2:1-11) -- a miracle of 

creation. Where there had been water (hydrogen and oxygen), now there was 

wine (complex organic molecules). It happened instantly at His command. He 

fed 5,000 people, and 4,000 men plus women and children. As He broke the 

bread and fish, He kept on multiplying them by creating more as His 

disciples watched.</p>
<p>
When Jesus healed a man born blind (John 9:1-7, 32), the man could not only 

see physically, but could understand what he was seeing. Jesus had not only 

healed his eyes but had programmed his brain to instantly recognise things 

he had never seen before.</p> 
<p>
On several occasions, for example, Jairus' daughter (Matt 9:18-19, 23-26) 

and Lazarus (John 11:1-46), Jesus, the author and Creator of life who thus 

had power over life and death, brought people back to life again.<br> When we 

understand, appreciate, and comprehend what Jesus did before witnesses in 

the Gospels as the Creator when He walked this earth, we should have no 

doubt about His ability to create the universe and everything in it as 

recorded in Gen 1.</p>
<p>
Jesus also spoke the truth, because He is the truth: <br><font color= "blue">"I 

am the way, the truth and the life" (John 14:6)</font>. <br>If He told us a lie 

He couldn't be the truth, and therefore the way.<br>Jesus said <font color= "blue">
"the creation 

which God created." (Mark 13:19)</font><br> He said: <font color= "blue">"From the beginning of the 

creation God made them male and female." (Matt 19:4, Mark 10:6)</font><br> At the 

beginning of creation, not billions of years later, God created them.<br> So 

Jesus was a young-universe, six-day creationist! Jesus spoke of the days of 

Noah (Matt 24:37 and Luke 17:26-27), recognising Noah as a literal man who 

lived. He spoke of Noah and his family entering the Ark and the Flood 

coming and taking them all away. So Jesus recognised the Flood, the Ark, 

and Gen 7 describing those events as real history.</p>
<h3>
At Creation and Beyond
</h3>
<p>
At the marriage feast in Cana (John 2:1-11) Jesus commanded servants to 

take huge water pots and fill them with water. He then told the servants to 

draw from the pots and take it to the Ruler of the Feast, who deemed it 

excellent wine. However, the Ruler of the Feast had used the assumption 

that the present is the key to the past! He used his own reasoning based on 

what he knew happens in the present. He assumed, based on everyday 

experience, this wine had come from grapes grown on vines, grapes that had 

been harvested and crushed, fermented, and bottled. He thought it had taken 

a long period of time, but he was wrong. Jesus had, in fact, created this 

wine. This then is the characteristic of anything God does in creation. 

From our experience it has an apparent age, an appearance of a non-existent 

history. And why did Jesus do this? He did it to meet an immediate 

need.</p>
<p>
When God commanded the fruit trees into existence He created them already 

bearing fruit. If we went back in time, we would have looked at those trees 

and would have said that they had taken years to grow and mature.<br> But God 

created a mature, fully-developed creation, because it was meant to be in 

existence immediately so that when Adam and Eve walked the earth three days 

later, their food needs would be met.</p>
<p>
And Peter says there was another period during which 

the rates of all of today's processes were suspended. The scoffers also 

will deliberately ignore the evidence for the Flood.</p>
<p>
We often think of Jesus being only present and active during creation, but 

He was also present and active during the Flood. Who closed the door of the 

Ark? God did. Noah didn't start the Flood. God was in charge of what 

happened during the Flood. We can have our geologic explanations, but 

ultimately God was present in judgement overturning this world, then 

restoring it with a new surface and a new biology afterwards.</p>
<h3>
Why Jesus Christ Came to Earth
</h3>
<p>
Genesis is not about our salvation. <br>However, Jesus said, <font color= 

"blue">"For if you believed Moses, you would believe Me; for he wrote about 

Me. But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?" 

(John 5:46-47)</font> <br>Which book of the Bible, under the inspiration of the 

Holy Spirit, did Moses compile? Jesus said if you don't believe what Moses 

wrote in Genesis how are you going to believe what I tell you?<br> Jesus said, 

<font color= "blue">"If I have told you earthly things and you do not 

believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?" (John 

3:12)</font></p>
<p>
Jesus Christ came to earth because of what happened in the Garden of Eden. 

When man chose to rebel against God, He cursed the ground for man's sake, 

and death and suffering resulted. Many say that Adam only died spiritually. <br>

But did Jesus come to just die spiritually? <br>Paul reminds us: <font color= "blue">
"For since by 

man came death, by Man came also the resurrection of the dead. For as in 

Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive." (1 Cor 15:21-22) </font><br>

Jesus had to physically die, because Adam began dying physically at the 

Fall (<font color= "blue">you shall surely die. Gen 2:17)</font>.</p>
<p>
How marvellous! The love of God for us, His grace and mercy, are so 

magnanimous, that none other than Jesus Christ, the Creator of the 

universe, stepped down from heaven's glory to come and die for us (Phil 

2:5-8).<br> The reason He could die for us was because He is the Creator. One 

man can die for one man (Rom 5:7), but only the Creator of the universe 

could die for all people, in all places, throughout all time. That's why we 

can be confident all our sins were nailed to His cross. Furthermore, as the 

Creator, He has power over life and death. No man could take His life so He 

laid it down willingly and had the power to take it up again. If He wasn't 

the Creator, how could He do those things?</p>
<h3>
Evolution Not Compatible
</h3>
<p>
If the Creator Jesus Christ used the evolutionary process, as some 

Christians maintain, then it means that He had to use death and destruction 

to create man, because evolution is said to have involved death and 

struggle over millions of years before man. This would have meant He really 

didn't have the ultimate power over death. He would thus have had to allow 

death to happen so that He could finally evolve man after millions of years 

of the deaths of "misfits" and imperfect biological experiments! So how 

could Calvary and the empty tomb then be accomplished? If Jesus had power 

over death when He walked the streets of Israel, and He had power over 

death when He rose from the grave, then He didn't need to use the 

evolutionary process. And Genesis tells us He didn't!</p>
<p>
Adam and Eve weren't walking on a fossil graveyard in the Garden of Eden, 

because <font color= "blue">
"God saw every thing that He had made, and, indeed, it was very good" (Gen 

1:31)</font>.<br> What God declares "very good" is measured against His own 

holiness, for as Jesus said: <font color= "blue">
"No one is good but One, that is, God." 

(Matt 19:17; Luke 18:19).</font> Death and violence came as a result of the Fall 

(Rom 5:12; Gen 3:17-18), and the wholesale destruction of life 

by God in judgement came later at the time of the Flood (Gen 7:21-23). It 

was sin, not evolution, which brought death into the world. The Gospel's 

salvation message is built on the foundation of who Jesus Christ is, and on 

what happened back in the Garden of Eden, as recorded in the historical 

account in Genesis.</p>
<h3>
A Personal Challenge
</h3>
<p>
In Rom 14:10 and 2 Cor 5:10 Paul states we all must stand before the 

judgement seat of Christ. Paul is speaking to Christians, not about a 

judgement for our sin. Rather, it's the same as in the parable Jesus told 

about the Master who returned and His servants had to account for how they 

had faithfully served him (Matt 25:14-30; Luke 19:12-24). So one day we 

have to stand before Jesus and give an account. How can any of us stand 

before Jesus and respond when He says something like: "You had my written 

and spoken Word, and my life's testimony, so why didn't you believe? I 

declared when I walked the streets of Israel that I was the Creator. I 

spoke the truth. Why didn't you believe what I told you in Genesis?"</p>
<p>
Do we really believe who Jesus Christ is? When we really believe that He is 

the all-knowing, all-powerful Creator of the universe, it must 

revolutionise how we live, think, and understand the world. Yes, there are 

many scientific questions we don't know the answers to, because we are 

finite, fallible, and subject to mistakes, misunderstandings, and faulty 

reasoning. But when we accept that God's authoritative Word and the living 

logos are His communication to us, then all those unanswered questions pale 

in significance to fully knowing Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>
However, so many Christians still choose the "tree of knowledge" (Gen 3:5-6) 

rather than the Word of God (Gen 2:17).<br> We fear man and man's knowledge, 

forgetting that:<br> <font color= "blue">
"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge" (Prov 

1:7)</font>, and <br><font color= "blue">
"The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom" (Prov 9:10)</font>. <br>As 

Jesus said, <font color= "blue">
"And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell" <br>(Matt 10:28)</font>. <br>Indeed, consider the <font color= "blue">"everlasting gospel" (Rev 

14:6)</font>.<br> <font color= "blue">
"Fear God, and give glory to Him; for the hour of His judgement has 

come: and worship Him that made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the 

springs of water" (Rev 14:7)</font>.</p>
