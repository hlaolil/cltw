   <h1>
Sign Language of John
</h1>
<h3>
A selective account of Jesus and His Ministry 
</h3>
<p>
Maybe you’ve wondered why we have four gospels rather than one. <br>None of the four are what we would call biographies of Jesus (in the sense of covering all of His life from birth to death), but rather are selective and interpretive accounts of His person and ministry. Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the synoptic (presenting the same view) gospels, because they have much that is similar, although each has a different slant. Matthew, one of the twelve, wrote primarily to Jews, emphasising that Jesus Christ is the King of Israel.</p> 
<p>
Mark, the shortest gospel, probably wrote from Rome under Peter’s influence. He emphasises Jesus as <font color= "blue">the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many (Mark 10:45)</font>. <br>Luke (the longest book in the New Testament by volume) was written by a physician and a co-worker with the apostle Paul, who also wrote the Book of Acts. His gospel is aimed at Gentiles and emphasises Jesus Christ’s humanity.</p>
<p>
But John has 93 percent original material in comparison to the synoptics.<br> As we’ve seen, John acknowledges that there were - <br><font color= "blue">“And truly Jesus did many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book;” (John 20:30)</font> <br>John ends his gospel by stating, <font color= "blue">“And there are also many other things that Jesus did, which if they were written one by one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.” (John 21:25)</font> <br>So John is selective. Most scholars think that he wrote his gospel sometime in the 80’s or early 90’s A.D., and so he most likely knew about the other gospels and did not feel the need to duplicate what they had written.</p>
<p>
John begins in eternity, identifying Jesus as God and Creator (John 1:1-3).<br> He omits many important things that the other gospels contain. <br>There is no mention of Jesus’ birth, His baptism, or His temptation.<br> There is no list of the twelve disciples. There are no stories of Jesus casting out demons and no parables (except perhaps John 10:1-6). <br>John tells us that he saw Jesus’ glory (John 1:14), but he doesn’t mention the transfiguration, even though he was one of the three eyewitnesses.</p> 
<p>
He includes Jesus’ promise that He is preparing a place for us in heaven and that He will return for us (John 14:1-3), but he omits Jesus’ lengthy prophetic discourses. John gives us the longest and most detailed account of events in the Upper Room on the night Jesus was betrayed, but he never mentions the Lord’s Supper. He doesn’t tell us about Jesus’ agony in the garden, although from John we learn that it was Peter who whacked off Malchus’ ear. And, although John records the risen Jesus telling Mary to tell the disciples that He will ascend to the Father (John 20:17), there is no account of Jesus’ ascension.</p>
<p>
Some of the features that are unique to John include his direct assertion that Jesus is the eternal God who created all things (John 1:2-3). <br>He alone says that Jesus is the only begotten Son of God (John 3:16,18).<br> John tells us of the first miracle of turning the water into wine (John 2:1-11). <br>He alone includes the interviews with Nicodemus and the woman at the well (John 3,4).<br> He tells us of Jesus’ healing the nobleman’s son (John 4:46-54), <br>the lame man by the pool of Bethesda (John 5:1-15),<br> and the man born blind (John 9:1-41). <br>John alone records Jesus’ raising Lazarus from the dead (John 11:1-44).<br> John tells us of Jesus’ washing the disciples feet (John 13:1-20) and <br>of His teaching in the Upper Room, where He gives the promise of the coming of the Holy Spirit (John 14-16). <br>John records the longest prayer of Jesus (John 17).<br> He tells us of Thomas doubts (John 20:24-29) and <br>of the disciples encounter with the risen Lord on the beach in Galilee (John 21).<br> John carefully chose all these events and much more to give us this selective insider’s portrait of our Saviour.</p>
<h3>
A Symbolic Account of Jesus and His Ministry 
</h3>
<p>
John is full of symbolic language that makes you stop and think about the deeper meaning of what he is saying. This does not mean that John bends the historical truth into fiction for the sake of his story. What John reports actually happened (John 21:24), but there is often a deeper significance behind the historical facts. Rather than referring to Jesus’ “miracles” or “wonders” (terms the other gospel writers use), John calls them “signs,” as we saw in: “many other signs Jesus also performed.” (John 20:30) A sign points to something beyond itself. John wants us to perceive the deeper meaning behind the miracle itself.</p>
<p>
Out of hundreds that he could have chosen, John picked seven signs, not counting Jesus’ resurrection and the miraculous post-resurrection catch of fish (John 21:1-14):<br> 
(1) Changing the water into wine (John 2:1-11); <br>
(2) Healing the nobleman’s son (John 4:46-54); <br>
(3) Healing the lame man by the Pool of Bethesda (John 5:1-9); <br>
(4) Feeding the 5,000 (John 6:1-14); <br>
(5) Walking on the water (John 6:16-21); <br>
(6) Healing the man born blind (John 9:1-12); and,<br>
(7) Raising Lazarus from the dead (John 11:1-46).</p>
<p>
In at least three of these miracles, we don’t have to guess as to their significance, because Jesus tells us.<br> After He feeds the 5,000, Jesus proclaims,<br> <font color= "blue">“I am the bread of life. He who comes to Me shall never hunger, and he who believes in Me shall never thirst.” (John 6:35)</font> <br>
Before opening the eyes of the man born blind, Jesus asserts,<br> <font color= "blue">“I am the light of the world. He who follows Me shall not walk in darkness, but have the light of life.” (John 8:12)</font><br> Before He raised Lazarus from the dead, Jesus told Martha,<br><font color= "blue"> “I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in Me will live even if he dies.” (John 11:25)</font></p>
<p>
By the way, these are three of seven “I am” claims that Jesus makes in John. The others are: <br><font color= "blue">“I am the door of the sheep” (John 10:7)<br></font> <font color= "blue">“I am the good shepherd” (John 10:11, 14)</font>; <br><font color= "blue">“I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me” (John 14:6)</font>; and, <br><font color= "blue">“I am the true vine” (John 15:1,5)</font>. <br>In each case we need to think about the symbolism of what Jesus is saying about Himself and how it relates to us.</p>
<p>
John also uses a number of key words that have symbolic significance. <br>John wrote so that you may have life in Jesus’ name (John 20:31). <br>Life is in Jesus (John 1:4) and He Himself is the life (John 11:25; 14:6).<br> Related to that is the concept of the new birth, which Jesus presents to Nicodemus (John 3:3-7). Physical life is a picture of the spiritual life that Jesus came to give to those who believe in Him. The opposite is that those who do not possess new life in Jesus are spiritually dead. They need Jesus’ resurrection power to receive life.</p>
<p>
Another symbolic picture is that of light and darkness. John says that the life in Jesus <font color= "blue">“was the Light of men.” (John 1:4)</font><br> Jesus is <font color= "blue">“the true Light” (John 1:9)</font>.<br>Then Jesus spoke to them again, saying,<font color= "blue"> “I am the light of the world.” <br>(John 8:12)</font> <br>But <font color= "blue">“men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil.” (John 3:19)</font> <br>Jesus proclaimed, <font color= "blue">“I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in Me should not abide in darkness.” (John 12:46)</font><br> When Judas left the Upper Room to betray Jesus, John was obviously reporting more than the time of day when he adds, <font color= "blue">“And it was night.” (John 13:30)</font><br>And yet oddly, John does not mention the three hours of darkness as Jesus hung on the cross (Matt 27:45; Mark 15:33; Luke 23:44)!</p>
<p>
Another key symbolic word is world, which occurs 78 times in John. <br><font color= "blue"> “He was in the world, and the world was made through Him, and the world did not know Him.” (John 1:10)</font> <br>In the first two uses, it refers to the earth and all that is in it, including the people. But in the third instance, it carries the nuance of sinful people who rejected Jesus. These people are under the dominion of Satan,<font color= "blue">“the ruler of this world” (John 12:31; 14:30; 16:11)</font> . <br>In this sense, the world hates both Jesus and His disciples <br>(John 7:7; 15:18; 16:20). <br>“World” can also refer to the people of the world in general, as when John states that <font color= "blue">“God so loved the world,” (John 3:16)</font> or when the Pharisees express their frustration, <font color= "blue">“the world has gone after Him.” (John 12:19)</font><br> Jesus asks the Father not to take His followers <font color= "blue">“out of the world, but that You should keep them from the evil one,” (John 17:15)</font> adding,<font color= "blue"> “They are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.” (John 17:16)</font></p>
<p>
There are a number of other key words that John repeats for emphasis to make us think about their significance. John uses witness 14 times as a noun and 33 times as a verb , while the other gospels combined only use the noun four times and the verb twice. He begins by saying that John (the Baptist; this gospel always calls him simply “John”) <font color= "blue">“came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all through him might believe.” <br>(John 1:7) (See also,John 1:8, 15, 19, 32, 34; 3:26; 5:33.)</font><br>There are seven witnesses to Jesus Christ in this gospel:<br>
(1) the Father;<br> 
(2) Christ Himself; <br>
(3) the Holy Spirit; <br>
(4) Jesus’ works; <br>
(5) the Scriptures; <br>
(6) John the Baptist; and, <br>
(7) a variety of human witnesses, such as the disciples, the Samaritan woman, and the multitude. <br>
These witnesses establish the truth, another key concept that John hammers on (25 times, over against once in Matthew and 3 times each in Mark and Luke).</p>
<p>
Two further concepts that have significance due to their repetition are that Jesus was sent (33 times referring to Jesus’ mission from God) to this earth by the Father to do His will at the appointed hour (12 times with reference to the cross). He told the disciples, <font color= "blue">“My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to finish His work.” (John 4:34)</font> <br>He emphasised to the unbelieving Jews that the Father had sent Him and that His works testified to that fact (John 5:23, 24, 30, 36, 37, 38). But although these evil men refused to believe in Jesus and finally succeeded in killing Him, John emphasises that it was all done in accordance with the Father’s sovereign timetable. When the hostile Jews sought to seize Jesus, they could not do so,<font color= "blue"> “because His hour had not yet come” (John 7:30; 8:20)</font>. But as the crucifixion drew near, Jesus proclaimed, <font color= "blue">
“The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified.” (John 12:23)</font></p>
<p>
If time permitted, I could also comment on other significant words, such as “flesh and spirit,” “love and hate,” and “knowledge and know.” I’ll comment on the key word “believe” in a moment. So John is both selective and symbolic.</p>
<h3>
An eyewitness account of the person and ministry of Jesus.
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“And truly Jesus did many other signs in the presence of His disciples, ...” <br>John (20:30)</font> <br>John himself was an eyewitness to these events that he reports, plus many others whom John knew. This establishes the truth of these events. It’s not surprising that liberals dispute that John wrote John, just as they dispute that Paul wrote many of his epistles.</p>
<p>
You can read many pages of arguments on the issue, which I don’t have time to recount here. Suffice it to say that there is credible internal and external evidence that John the apostle wrote the Gospel of John.<br>The internal evidence refers to the many indicators in the book itself that it was written by an eyewitness and that the eyewitness was John, who refers to himself as <font color= "blue">“the disciple whom Jesus loved” (John 21:20,24)</font>.<br> The external evidence refers to the early church fathers, such as Irenaeus, Tertullian, and Clement of Alexandria, who attest that John wrote this gospel. Irenaeus said that in his early days he used to sit in Polycarp’s house and listen to him tell about his talks with John and others who had seen the Lord. <br>So when Irenaeus declares categorically that after the other Gospels were written, John also wrote his while living in Ephesus, it’s pretty solid evidence that John wrote John </p>
<h3>
So that you may believe in Jesus as the Christ 
</h3>
<p>
John wants you to believe, not in generalities, but in specific, true content: that Jesus is the Messiah and the Son of God so that you will have eternal life in all that He is (His “name”). But John makes it clear that the proper response to the truth about Jesus is not automatic. In spite of the strong evidence, people divide over Jesus. Even after He raised Lazarus from the dead, many believed, but others went away to the Pharisees to report on what Jesus had done, with the result that they increased their efforts to kill Him (John 11:45-53).<br> The raising of Lazarus clearly proved that Jesus is the resurrection and the life, but that didn’t stop the Pharisees from wanting to kill Him! Sin is not rational!</p>
<p>
John uses the verb, believe, 98 times, but strangely he never uses the noun. <br>For John, faith must have content that is true. You must believe certain truths about Jesus. But faith is also personal commitment to the person of Jesus Christ, where you enter into a relationship with Him. To believe in Jesus is to trust Him as your Saviour and Lord and walk in obedience to His commands. As we’ll see, it’s possible to have a superficial belief in Jesus that does not result in eternal life (John 2:23-25; 8:31-59).</p>
<p>
For John belief in Jesus is both initial and ongoing as a person learns more about who Jesus is. The disciples initially believed in Jesus when they first met Him, based on the testimony of John the Baptist (John 1:7, 49-50).<br> But they also believed when they saw Jesus perform His first miracle, turning the water into wine (John 2:11).<br> But they (John 11:15; see, also, 13:19; 14:1, 10, 11, 29; 16:27, 30-31) and Martha (John 11:27, 40) still needed to believe before they saw Jesus raise Lazarus from the dead. Yet John reports that when he went into the empty tomb and saw Jesus’ grave clothes, he believed (John 20:8).<br> Obviously, Thomas had believed in Jesus before the resurrection, but his faith was shaken by the crucifixion. He had to see the risen Saviour so that he would not <font color= "blue">“be unbelieving, but believing” (John 20:27)</font>.
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
So the first crucial question is, “Who do you say that Jesus is?” <br>After you’ve answered it, the second crucial question is, “Have you believed in Him so that you have eternal life?” If not, why not? <br>If so, you still need to believe further in Him as you get to know more of who He is. Ask God to reveal more of Jesus to your heart as you study the Gospel of John.</p>
