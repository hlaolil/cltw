   <h1>
The Teaching of God
</h1>
<h3>
How Can We Know That Jesus Is God's Spokesman?
</h3>
<p>
How can the Jews know that this claim to speak for God is true? How can they—and how can we—know whether Jesus' teaching is from God or merely from Himself? If we are going to receive Jesus for who He really is, we must know whether He is God's true spokesman. How can we know?</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"If anyone wills to do His will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is from God or whether I speak on My own authority". (John 7:17 )</font></p>
<p>
Let's look at this very carefully. How shall someone know if Jesus' teaching is of God? A person shall know (according to a literal rendering) "if one is willing to do His (that is, God's) will." The condition of knowing is willing.</p>
<h3>
A Will That Wills What God Wills
</h3>
<p>
Now if we must know whether the teaching of Jesus is of God before we can receive Him as He is—and surely we must—then the way the heart is prepared to receive Jesus is by getting a certain kind of will, namely, a will that wills what God wills.</p>
<p>
This is very crucial for understanding how we come to receive Christ.<br> To receive Christ you must recognise Him for who He really is, namely,<br> One whose teaching is God's teaching and not merely man's. But, Jesus says in John 7:17, you will never know this about Him (and thus never receive Him for who He is) unless you have a will that inclines to do the will of God.</p>
<p>
He is not merely saying that a certain kind of willing (or wanting or desiring or inclining or preferring) must precede our receiving Christ. He is saying that a certain kind of willing must precede our knowing, our recognising, that Christ is worthy of being received. He is not merely saying you have to want Jesus in order to receive Jesus.<br> He is saying you have to want your whole life to be shaped by the will of God in order to even recognise Jesus. To paraphrase the verse: "If anyone wills (wants, prefers, desires) to do the will of God, then and only then will that person be able to know the divine authority of Jesus—that His teaching is God's."</p>
<p>
So Jesus is saying that the basic reason why people do not own up to the truth of what He teaches is not that they lack sufficient evidence, but that their wills—or we could say their hearts—are against God. The fundamental problem is not intellectual but moral. The great obstacle to recognising the truth of Christ is not deficient resources but deep rebellion against God. <br>People cannot see and recognise the truth of Christ's teaching because the prevailing tendency of their will is insubordination against the authority of God.</p>
<h3>
Willing What the Devil Wills
</h3>
<p>
There is only one close parallel to John 7:17 in this gospel. It is a text that says exactly the reverse of what 7:17 says, but it sheds much light on the meaning of our text. <br>
John 7:17 speaks of one whose will is to do the will of God.<br> 
John 8:44 speaks of those whose will is to do the will of the devil.<br>
Jesus asks the question, <font color= "blue">"Why do you not understand My speech? Because you are not able to listen to My word." (John 8:43)</font> <br> But why can't they hear His word? They are hearing Him with their physical ears. What does He mean that they cannot hear? And if they can't hear, why are they responsible to hear? Why are they guilty for not hearing?</p>
<p>
Jesus answers those questions. The reason they can't hear His word is that they are of their father the devil, and their will is to do their father's desires.<br> <font color= "blue">"You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires." (John 8:44)</font></p>
<h3>
Aligning with the Will of God
</h3>
<p>
Jesus says that if our will is to do the will of God, we will recognise that His teaching is divine. Here He says that if our will is to do the will of the devil, we will not be able to hear or know His teaching.<br>

Before we can hear the word of Christ and recognise it as sent from God and worthy of being received, our will must be brought into alignment with the will of God. Something has to happen deep down in the root of our will to remove the rebellion against God that we all have by nature. Something has to happen to take away our antagonism against the authority of God.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be. So then, those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His. (Rom 8:7-9)</font></p>
<p>
The mind of the flesh is hostile toward God, for it does not submit to God's law, indeed it cannot; and those who are in the flesh cannot please God.<br>
In other words, apart from the work of the Holy Spirit, our wills are deeply, often unknowingly, antagonistic toward God and resistant to His authority, insubordinate to His law, and so unable to please Him.</p>
<h3>
Rebellious Wills and Blind Eyes 
</h3>
<p>
Now Jesus adds that unless this rebellious bent of our wills is changed, we will never be able to even recognise the divine beauty of His teaching and know that it is from God. When He says, "If anyone's will is to do God's will, he shall know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority," he means that our hard, fallen, rebellious will must become soft and docile and compliant to the will of God if we are ever going to be able to assess the teaching of Jesus accurately. A rebellious will toward God produces a blind eye toward Jesus.</p>
<h3>
Why Is a Rebellious Will Blind to Jesus?
</h3>
<p>
But will the text let us be any more specific? What is it about the teaching of Jesus that makes it so hard for a rebellious will to see? Or, reversing the question, what is it about a rebellious will that makes it so blind to the teaching of Jesus? <br>Jesus goes on to say,
<font color= "blue">
He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who seeks the glory of the One who sent Him is true, and no unrighteousness is in Him. (John 7:18)</font><br>
Here Jesus gives an objective criterion for assessing His truth. If His life is devoted to enjoying and magnifying the glory of God, and not His own private glory, then He is true.</p>
<p>
But now put these verses together and see what you come up with. <br>John 7:17 says that in order to recognise the divine truth of Jesus' teaching the rebellion of your will must be overcome so that it wills what God wills.<br> John 7:18 says that in order to recognise the truth of Jesus you need to see that His life is devoted to the glory of God.</p>
<h3>
Two Facts and Two Conclusions 
</h3>
<p>
When I look at these two verses together I see two facts and I draw two conclusions:
<p><font size="+1">
Fact 1</font></p>
<p> 
The truth of Jesus is shown by His commitment to enjoy and magnify the glory of God rather than seeking His own private glory (John 7:18).
<p><font size="+1">
Fact 2</font></p>
<p>  
The rebellion of our fallen will makes us blind to the truth of Jesus. (If we willed what God willed, we would see the truth (John 7:17).)
<p><font size="+1">
Conclusion 1</font></p>
<p>  
Therefore the specific thing that our wills rebel against in the will of God is that His glory not ours should be the quest and passion of our lives.
<p><font size="+1">
Conclusion 2</font></p>
<p>  
Therefore the reason we can't see the truth of Jesus is because He embodies the will of God which we hate, namely, that God's glory and not ours should be the quest and passion of our lives.</p>
<h3>
Jesus says to Those who Reject Him
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
I do not receive honour from men. But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in you. I have come in My Father's name, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, him you will receive. How can you believe, who receive honour from one another and do not seek the honour that comes from the only God? (John 5:41-44)</font><br>
In other words you can't believe if your will is bent on relishing the honour that comes from men and not the honour that comes from God. <br>Which is just another way of saying, We will never recognise the truth of Jesus until our will is to do God's will, namely, to love the honour of God above our own.</p>
<p>
When we come to will what God wills, namely, the enjoyment and magnification of His glory, then we shall know concerning the teaching of Jesus, whether it is of God. And we will receive Him for who He really is—the way, the truth, and the life.</p>
<p>
Prepare your hearts to receive the Lord for who He really is. Cultivate a love for the glory of God.</p>
<p>
And if you want to love the glory of God above all other glories, then you will study God and spend time with lovers of God, and listen to God and look at God and gaze and gaze and gaze at the revelation of the glory of God.
