True Freedom 
</h1>
<h3>
The Truth Shall Make You Free
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Then Jesus said to those Jews who believed Him, “If you abide in My word, you are My disciples indeed. And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” They answered Him, “We are Abraham’s descendants, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How can You say, You will be made free?”<br>Jesus answered them, “Most assuredly, I say to you, whoever commits sin is a slave of sin. And a slave does not abide in the house forever, but a son abides forever. Therefore if the Son makes you free, you shall be free indeed.<br> (John 8:31-36)</font></p>
<p>
The Jews with whom Jesus was speaking in our text thought that they were spiritually free through their descent from Abraham. “We are Abraham’s descendants and have never yet been enslaved to anyone; how is it that You say, You will become free?” Jesus explains that even though they don’t see it, they are actually enslaved to sin. He shows them (and us) the way to true spiritual freedom.<br>
True freedom comes from knowing Christ through genuine faith and abiding in His word.</p>
<h3>
A Warning and an Invitation
</h3>
<p>
Jesus gives these arrogant Jews both a warning and an invitation.<br>After stating that they are slaves to sin, He gives the warning, “The slave does not remain in the house forever; the son does remain forever.”<br> He means, “As descendants of Abraham, you’re in God’s household, but because of sin, you’re in His household as slaves, not as true sons. Slaves don’t enjoy the full privileges of sons. Slaves can be expelled from the household at any time, especially if they’re not faithful. You’re currently enjoying the privileges of being in God’s household, but you could lose this status if you continue in your sinful ways.”</p>
<p>
Since they had mentioned Abraham, the story of Ishmael, the son of Hagar the slave, is behind John 8:35. When Ishmael taunted Isaac, Abraham was forced to expel him from his household. <br>The Jews who were threatening to kill Jesus (John 8:37,40) were in danger of losing the privileges of being in God’s household (Rom 9:4-5). <br>But Jesus didn’t leave them with a warning only. He gave them an invitation, “Therefore if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.”  (John 8:36)<br> He’s saying, “Come to Me; I will give you true freedom.”</p>
<h3>
Superficial Faith
</h3>
<p>
It’s possible to have a superficial, false faith in Christ that does not save from sin.<br>
<font color= "blue">
“As He spoke these things, many came to believe in Him.” (John 8:30)</font><br>
Jesus was addressing the following comments to the Jews who had believed Him. (John 8:31) So you would think that these people had come to know Christ through faith.<br> But as the dialogue continues through the chapter, we learn that not only were they slaves of sin (John 8:34), also<br>
they were seeking to kill Jesus (John 8:37,40); <br>God was not their Father (John 8:42);<br> in fact, they were children of the devil (John 8:44);<br> they accused Jesus of having a demon (John 8:48);<br> they were liars (8:55);<br> and they attempted to kill Jesus (John 8:59).<br> So why does John say that these Jews believed in Jesus?</p>
<p>
The best interpretation is that the “believers” in John 8:30,31 are like those back in John 2:23, who believed in Jesus after seeing some of His miracles, but Jesus didn’t entrust Himself to them, because He knew that their faith was superficial.<br> We saw that same false faith in John 6:60, when many of Jesus’ disciples turned away from Him after He said some difficult things that they didn’t like. <br>False faith is implied in John 8:31, where Jesus says that if they continue in His word, they are truly His disciples. And so we should conclude that it’s possible to have a superficial, false faith in Christ that does not save from sin.</p>
<p>
Other New Testament texts support this view. Jesus’ parable of the sower <br>(Luke 8:5-15) mentions the seed that was sown on the rocky, thin soil.<br> These people received the word with joy, but they had no root. <br>They believed for a while, but in a time of temptation or trial, they fell away.<br> The same was true of the seed sown among the thorny ground. Eventually the thorns choked out the word, so that it did not bear fruit.<br> We see the same thing in the warning passages in Heb (6:4-8; 10:26-31) and in John’s mention of the false teachers who went out from the church, but never were genuine believers (1 John 2:19).<br> Paul mentions false apostles who disguise themselves as workers of righteousness (2 Cor 11:13-15).</p>
<p>
I’ve seen the same thing many times, even with some who have served for a while in some capacity in the church. Perhaps they came to faith at a time when many of their friends were professing faith in Christ. It was the cool thing to do. Or, maybe they came to Jesus because they were told that He would give them some blessing or solve some difficult problem that they were wrestling with. <br>But when things didn’t go as they had hoped, they fell away. Some now even deny the faith that they once professed.</p>
<p>
How can we know that our own faith is genuine? I’ll say more about that in a moment, but for now, note two marks of false faith that we see in these “believing unbelievers”:
<p><font size="+1">
Those with False Faith do not Recognise their own Slavery to Sin</font></p>
<p>
After Jesus tells them (John 8:32), “And you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free,” they react defensively by asserting that they are Abraham’s descendants and they have never been enslaved to anyone.<br> They couldn’t be referring to political slavery, since the nation had been enslaved in Egypt for 400 years, plus to many other foreign powers, such as Babylon, Greece, and (as they spoke) Rome. So they must mean that they were spiritually free and, as Jews, always had been free.</p>
<p>
But they were blind to their self-righteousness and spiritual pride. <br>Their religion was externally impressive, but their hearts were far from God (Mark 7:6-7). <br>Jesus, who knew their hearts, reamed them out:<br> <font color= "blue">“Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which indeed appear beautiful outwardly, but inside are full of dead men’s bones and all uncleanness. Even so you also outwardly appear righteous to men, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.” (Matt 23:27-28)</font> <br>They thought that they were righteous, but their sin deceived them so that they didn’t see their own slavery to sin.</p>
<p>
As I said last week, the starting point for going to heaven is to recognise that you are a guilty sinner in God’s sight. If you think that you’re good enough to go to heaven, or that by adding a few more good deeds, you’ll merit eternal life, you don’t understand God’s absolute holiness and justice. If our good deeds could get us into heaven, then Christ did not need to die on the cross. Invariably, those with false faith do not see their own slavery to sin.<br> They brush it off by thinking that they just have a few faults.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Those with false faith trust in their own righteousness / religion not in Christ alone.</font></p>
<p>
These Jews were trusting in their religious heritage as descendants of Abraham to put them in right standing with God. John the Baptist had already hit them with this when he called them to repentance: <br><font color= "blue">“And do not think to say to yourselves, We have Abraham as our father. For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.”  (Matt 3:9)</font> <br>If you think that going to church or going through religious rituals or giving money or any religious activity will commend you to God, you do not have genuine saving faith in Christ. You aren’t truly free spiritually.<br> False faith does not save from sin.</p>
<h3>
True Freedom comes from Christ's Word through Genuine Faith
</h3>
<p>
In John 8:31, Jesus says, “If you continue in My word, then you are truly disciples of Mine.” The mark of genuine faith is not just mental or verbal profession that you believe in Christ. The mark of true faith is to continue (or, “abide”) in Jesus’ word. This is not the condition for getting saved; rather, it’s an evidence that you are truly saved. It’s the evidence that your faith in Christ is genuine. So, we need to understand what Christ’s word is and what it means to continue or abide in it.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Christ’s word is the same as God’s Word</font></p>
<p>
Christ’s word is everything that He taught, summed up in all that He is and all that He did for us on the cross. Jesus said that all of Scripture speaks of Him, His suffering, and the glory to follow (Luke 24:25-27,44-46).<br> Jesus told the Jews, <font color= "blue">“But you do not have His word abiding in you, because whom He sent, Him you do not believe. You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify of Me.” <br> (John 5:38-39)"</font></p>
<p>
To continue in Christ’s word implies that you first started in His word. <br> The starting point for saving faith is when you recognise from God’s Word that you’re a sinner and that Christ died to pay the penalty for your sin. <br> God saves you when you stop trusting in your own good works and instead rely totally on what Jesus did for you on the cross and believe that God raised Jesus from the dead. Christ’s word is the same as God’s Word. The central message of God’s Word is how we can be reconciled to God through faith in Jesus’ death and resurrection.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
To Continually know Christ’s word and to Obey it.</font></p>
<p>
“Continue” translates the Greek word translates as “abide” (John 15:4, 6,7,10). It means to dwell or be at home in God’s Word. You don’t just visit the Word as an occasional guest. You move in and live there. You wake up there and you return there every night. The Word shapes your world view. <br> It governs and guides your thinking, your attitudes, your speech, and your behaviour. There isn’t any area of your life that is not subject to God’s Word or influenced by it. Continuing or abiding obviously implies time spent in the Word over the long haul.</p>
<p>
Are you abiding in God’s Word? Do you “live” there? Are you comfortable there? Do you know its rooms? Do you enjoy its many amenities that are for your blessing? Do you seek to obey it? Let me suggest a radical idea that could transform your life: <br> Turn off your TV, computer, and phone for between one half to one hour each day and spend the time reading, meditating on, and memorising God’s Word with the prayer that you might know Christ better. God’s promise applies to us: <font color= "blue">“This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success.” (Joshua 1:8)</font></p>
<p>
We’ve seen that it’s possible to have false faith that does not save.<br>  True freedom comes from knowing Christ through genuine faith, which means to continue in His word.</p>
<h3>
Christ’s word is the truth that sets us free when we abide in it
</h3>
<p>
Rather than being a slave of sin, “you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free” (John 8:34). “So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.” (John 8:32) So, how does abiding in Christ’s word of truth set us free?
<p><font size="+1">
Abiding in Christ’s word sets us free from spiritual ignorance</font></p>
<p>
Jesus emphasises truth in this dialogue (John 8:32[2x],40,44[2x],45,46), which refers especially to saving truth.<br> Those who do not know God are in spiritual darkness (Eph 4:18).<br> They cannot understand the things of the Spirit of God (1 Cor 2:14). <br>They do not know why they’re on earth or what will happen after they die. <br>But when we come to know the truth through knowing Christ, all the riches of God’s grace are opened to us (1 Cor 2:9-10; Col 2:2-3).</p>
<p>
This is illustrated even in the natural realm: truth liberates, but ignorance keeps people in bondage. A person who can read is much freer than an illiterate person. He is free to study medicine or law or finance or whatever field interests him.<br> But the illiterate person is severely restricted in what he can do.<br>
In the same way, spiritual ignorance keeps a person from knowing the living and true God and from being conformed to the image of Jesus Christ. <br>Ignorance cuts a person off from enjoying the many blessings that are ours in Him. Abiding in Christ’s word opens the treasure chest and frees us to enjoy Him.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Abiding in Christ’s word sets us free from slavery to sin.</font></p>
<p>
This is the primary focus of Jesus’ words, “Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin.” (John 8:34) Jesus does not mean that committing a single act of sin enslaves a person (although one sin is the first step to slavery), but rather that a person who continues in sin is under its domination. But as we abide in Christ’s word, we can experience consistent victory over sin, beginning on the thought level (where all sin begins).</p>
<p>
Note that religion can’t free a person from slavery to sin. These Jews were as religious as they could be and yet Jesus asserts that they were slaves to sin. They were trying to kill the sinless Son of God, but they thought that they were spiritually free! The first step to being free from sin is to recognise your slavery to it.</p>
<p>
You can apply this to any sin: anger, jealousy, bitterness, drunkenness, selfishness, or whatever. If you abide in God’s Word, you will be freed from bondage to those sins. If you do not abide in the Word, you will be enslaved to various sins.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Abiding in Christ’s word sets us free to serve others in love</font></p>
<p>
Paul wrote, <font color= "blue">“For you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only do not use liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.”<br> (Gal 5:13)</font></p>
<p>
Before we were saved, we lived to serve ourselves. We indulged the flesh, thinking that it would satisfy. But Christ saved us and set us free from selfishness so that we can serve others in love.</p>
<p>As Jesus said,<font color= "blue">
“Whoever desires to be first among you shall be slave of all. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.”(Mark 10:44-45)</font></p>
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
Let’s come back to John Piper’s description of true freedom: “You are fully free when you have the desire, the ability, and the opportunity to do what will leave you with no regrets forever.” When you truly believe in Christ, He gives you the desire to please Him who lavished His grace upon you. He gives you the ability to obey Him as you walk in the Spirit who lives in you. <br>He gives you opportunities daily to say no to sin and selfishness and to serve others in love. And you will dwell with Jesus in heaven forever, with no regrets that you left your life of sin to follow Him.</p>
<p>
That’s the true freedom that comes from knowing Christ through genuine faith and abiding in His word! If you’re still a slave of sin, Jesus offers you true freedom: “If the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed” (John 8:36).</p>
