   <h1>
The Light of the World
</h1>
<h3>
A Blinding Light
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world." (John 

9:5)</font>. <br>And to demonstrate it, He healed a man who had been born 

blind. He came to help people see, to help them understand something about 

God’s love for them.</p>
<p>
But Jesus also said that He came to bring blindness:<br> <font color= 

"blue">“For judgement I have come into this world, that those who do not 

see may see, and that those who see may be made blind.” (John 

9:39)</font>.<br> 
This is a hard saying — it is easy to understand a physician who came to 

heal the sick, but it is hard to understand a physician who came to make 

healthy people sick.</p>
<h3>
Whose fault is it
</h3>
<p>
Let’s review the story in John 9. As Jesus and the disciples walked 

through Jerusalem, they saw a blind man. Somehow they knew that the man 

had been blind from birth, and the disciples used the opportunity to ask 

Jesus a theological question that had puzzled them: Whose fault is this, 

they asked, did the man sin before he was born, or is he being punished 

because his parents sinned? Problems like this, they assumed, are the 

result of sin, but who sinned?</p>
<p>
Neither answer seemed right, <font color= "blue">Jesus answered, “Neither 

this man nor his parents sinned, but that the works of God should be 

revealed in him." (John 9:3)</font>. <br>Did God cause the man to be blind 

just so that Jesus could do a miracle?<br> I don’t think that is what Jesus is 

driving at.</p>
<p>
Jesus seems to be talking about the result rather than the purpose or 

cause.<br> The man was born blind, and it doesn’t do him or anyone else any 

good for us to speculate about whose sin caused it. The man does not need 

a discussion about the causes of evil — he needs his sight, and Jesus said 

that the result of his condition is that "the work of God" would be seen 

in him.<br> And by that, I think that Jesus was talking about more than a 

miracle.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"I must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day; the night is 

coming when no one can work." (John 9:4)</font> <br> 
A modern proverb that is roughly equivalent is, "Make hay while the sun 

shines" — or work while you can, because, as Jesus warns, a time will come 

when you can’t." When will that be, we might wonder. When will it not be 

possible to do the work of God?<br>
Jesus continued, <font color= "blue">"As long as I am in the world, I am 

the light of the world"<br> (John 9:5)</font>. As long as He is here, it is 

daytime — but a time would come when He would go away and the work would 

stop. Fortunately for us, that "night" did not last long, for Jesus was 

raised from the dead and now works in and through His people. (We also 

need to work while we can, because a time will come for each of us when we 

can do no more.)</p>
<h3>
Blind obedience
</h3>
<p>
Jesus illustrated what He meant by being a light to the world,<br> <font 

color= "blue">He spat on the ground and made clay with the saliva; and He 

anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay. And He said to him, “Go, 

wash in the pool of Siloam” (John 9:6-7) </font>. <br>It’s hard to know from 

this account how much the man knew about Jesus. <br>He knew his name, but may 

not have known much more than that. <br>But he went to the Pool of Siloam 

anyway, and he was healed. <br>It would have been interesting to see his 

reaction, but all we are told is that he went home.</p>
<p>
Now, why did Jesus heal the man in such an unusual way? If He just wanted 

to display a miracle, He would have healed him instantly. He could have 

said to His disciples, I can give spiritual sight just like this: snap! 

But the disciples did not see a miracle — all they saw was that Jesus put 

mud on somebody’s face and then told him to go wash it off.</p>
<p>
John never does tell us how they reacted when they eventually found out. <br>

So the story that John is telling here is not so much about the miracle — 

it is about how the man learns who Jesus is, and how he reacts when he 

does.<br> This is the far more important work of God that is being 

demonstrated in this man’s life.</p>
<p>
The news got around, and the man told people that <font color= "blue">"A 

Man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me, ‘Go to the 

pool of Siloam and wash.’ So I went and washed, and I received sight. 

(John 9:11)</font>.<br> 
Then the Pharisees, the self-appointed judges of all spiritual truth, 

started to investigate this supernatural event. Some of them had already 

concluded that<font color= "blue"> “This Man is not from God, because He 

does not keep the Sabbath.” </font><br>(Even God himself had to 

keep their rules, apparently.) <font color= "blue">“How can a man who is a sinner do 

such signs?” And there was a division among them. (John 9:16)</font>. <br>So 

they asked the formerly blind man <font color= "blue">“What do you say 

about Him because He opened your eyes?” “He is a prophet.” (John 

9:17)</font> the man replied. </p>
<p>
The Jews, or at least some of them, didn’t seem to like that answer, so 

they searched for a way to discredit the miracle. They asked his parents 

about it,<br> <font color= "blue">Is this your son, who you say was born 

blind? How then does he now see?”<br> His parents answered them and said, “We 

know that this is our son, and that he was born blind; but by what means 

he now sees we do not know, or who opened his eyes we do not know. He is 

of age; ask him. He will speak for himself.”  His parents said these 

things because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had agreed already that 

if anyone confessed that He was Christ, he would be put out of the 

synagogue. Therefore his parents said, “He is of age; ask him.”(John 9:19

-23)</font>.</p>
<p>
I feel sorry for the parents. They had probably lived for years with the 

accusation that their son was blind because they had sinned. They needed 

the synagogue because faithful attendance was the only way they could show 

they were good people after all. Even though their son could now see, they 

were not willing to risk expulsion — and John probably includes this 

because it was precisely the situation that some of his readers faced. 

After Jerusalem was destroyed in A.D. 70, the Jewish leaders regrouped and 

began demanding more conformity; they did not allow people to attend 

synagogue if they had any forbidden beliefs about a messiah.</p>
<p>
John set before us several types of people:<br>
1) Some who had already made up their minds that Jesus was ungodly. <br>
2) Some who were puzzled by Jesus but still tried to discredit Him. <br>
3) Some who refuse to say, and probably don’t even want to find out because &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;they were afraid of the consequences.<br> 
4) The man who viewed Jesus as good, and was willing to learn more.</p>
<h3>
Growing in faith
</h3>
<p>
The Jewish leaders went back to the healed man and asked him again, and he 

told them again. <font color= "blue">"We know this man is a sinner," they 

said (John 9:24)</font>.<br> I’m not sure about that, the man replied, but I 

know for sure that I’ve been healed. He must have been a little 

exasperated with their attitude, for he asked, <font color= "blue">"I have 

told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? 

Do you want to become His disciples?" (John 9:27).</font></p>
<p>
The leaders were offended by this idea, so they responded with insults, 

drawing a line in the sand:<br><font color= "blue"> "You are His disciple, but 

are Moses' disciples. We know that God spoke to Moses; as for this fellow, 

we do not know where He is from".  The man answered and said to them, 

“Why, this is a marvellous thing, that you do not know where He is from; 

yet He has opened my eyes! Now we know that God does not hear sinners; but 

if anyone is a worshipper of God and does His will, He hears him.  Since 

the world began it has been unheard of that anyone opened the eyes of one 

who was born blind.  If this Man were not from God, He could do nothing.” 

They answered and said to him, “You were completely born in sins, and are 

you teaching us?” And they cast him out. (John 9:28-34)</font><br>
John knew his readers needed to hear that, too. Don’t worry about getting 

kicked out of the synagogue, he seems to say. You should have left it long 

ago, anyway.</p>
<p>
That’s the central question that runs throughout the Gospel of John: <br>Is 

Jesus from God? The man declared that Jesus is from God.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when He had found him, He said 

to him, “Do you believe in the Son of God?” He answered and said, “Who is 

He, Lord, that I may believe in Him?” And Jesus said to him, “You have 

both seen Him and it is He who is talking with you.” Then he said, “Lord, 

I believe!” <br>And he worshipped Him. (John 9:35-38)</font><br> 
Just as he could see physically, he could also see spiritually, and in 

this way he displayed the work of God in his life.</p>
<h3>
Judgement
</h3>
<p>
Jesus now gives another theological lesson: <font color= 

"blue"></font>"For judgement I have come into this world, that those who do 

not see may see, and that those who see may be made blind." (John 9:39) 

</font>
Jesus is the category by which all humanity will be judged. If people 

accept Him, then God accepts them. But if they reject Him, they are 

rejected. In other words, when a person refuses light, they have only 

darkness. Jesus is claiming to be the way, the truth and the life. <br>Here He 

says He is the light, the one who enables people to see.<br>
Some people refuse to see. Some are afraid, because Jesus nullifies their 

badges of righteousness. And when they turn away from Jesus, from the only 

true Light, they go further into darkness. In this story, the leaders of 

the synagogue would rather be blind than to admit that they had been 

wrong.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Then some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these words, and said 

to Him, “Are we blind also?” Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you 

would have no sin; but now you say, ‘We see.’ Therefore your sin remains." 

(John 9:40-41)</font> he was not talking about people who really had 

spiritual insight. <br>Rather, he was talking about people who only thought 

their insight was spiritual light, when it really was only darkness. They 

claimed to know spiritual truth, but when the Truth was right in front of 

them, they would not see it. <br>Jesus did not make them blind, but he showed 

that they were blind.</p>
<p>
People are judged by the way they respond to Jesus. <br>If they admit their 

ignorance and are willing to be taught, they are not counted guilty. But 

if they claim to see, yet reject the only true Light, then they are 

guilty.<br>

When you look at Jesus, what do you see?</p>
