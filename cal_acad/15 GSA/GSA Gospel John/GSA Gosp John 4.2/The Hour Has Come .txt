<h1>
The Hour Has Come 
</h1>
<p>
Jesus talks about His death, which He refers to as being "glorified" and "lifted up" and has a final exchange with the Jewish leaders who are intent on discrediting and killing Him.</p>

"The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified." (John 12:23)</font> </p>
<p>
"Being glorified" seems like a strange way to describe one's death, but we see this idea in the great Suffering Servant passage that begins in Isa 52:13 and extends to chapter 53.</p>

"Behold, My Servant shall deal prudently; He shall be exalted and extolled and be very high." (Isa 52:13)</font></p>
<p>
Jesus seems to use "being glorified" to refer to His death, resurrection, and ascension.</p>

"for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified." (John 7:39b)</font></p>

"when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about Him and that they had done these things to Him." (John 12:16b)</font></p>

"These things Isaiah said when he saw His glory and spoke of Him." (John 12:41)</font></p>
<p>
To the men on the road to Emmaus, Jesus explained the Scriptures and then said:<br>
<font color= "blue">"Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into His glory?" (Luke 24:26)</font></p>
<p>
It's like us humans to think that suffering and pain are bad, and ease is good. But when do we learn the most? When do we make the greatest strides forward? When we're really struggling. We look back at some of those times and marvel how God has helped us. <br>
It's in the afflictions that God's glory shines its brightest. When a lame man walks. When a man born blind sees. It's at times like that the Jesus' glory peeks out for all to see. And on the dark, dark day of the cross, when Jesus says, "It is finished," and breathes his last, his glory blazes out once more as the power of Satan and sin are broken, sin is atoned, and men and women are set free. When, like Moses, we pray, <font color= "blue">"Please, show me Your glory." (Ex 33:18)</font>, the answer may not be what we anticipated, but when his glory is revealed, it's all worth it.</p>
