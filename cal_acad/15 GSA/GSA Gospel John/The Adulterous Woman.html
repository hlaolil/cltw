   <h1>
The Adulterous Woman
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. Early in the morning He came again into the temple and all the people came to Him, and He sat down and taught them." (John 8:1-2)</font></p>
<p>
So, here hardly even taking a break, Jesus is back in the temple early in the morning; all the people were coming and He was continuing to teach.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Then the scribes and Pharisees brought to Him a woman caught in adultery. And when they had set her in the midst, they said to Him, “Teacher, this woman was caught in adultery, in the very act. Now Moses, in the law, commanded us that such should be stoned. But what do You say?”" (John 8:3-5)</font><br>
Here the scribes and Pharisees had brought this adulterous woman, but obviously not to justify the law, if so they would have also brought the man.<br> He had broken the law just as much she had. The law required that both be stoned to death.(Lev 20:10)</p>
<p>
They were simply using the woman as a trap, hoping to trick Jesus. <br>The Romans didn't permit the Jews to carry out their own executions, so if He had ordered her stoned, they would have reported Him to the Romans; if He had said she should not be stoned, they would accuse Him of breaking Moses' law.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"This they said, testing Him, that they might have something of which to accuse Him. But Jesus stooped down and wrote on the ground with His finger, as though He did not hear" (John 8:6)</font><br>
We aren't told what, if anything, Jesus wrote in the dust with His finger.<br> Some see a connection to when God wrote the ten commandments, but there is no scriptures to substantiate this view. There is no reason to debate what He may have written, or to think it was mistakenly left out of this scripture.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"So when they continued asking Him, He raised Himself up and said to them, “He who is without sin among you, let him throw a stone at her first." (John 8:7)</font>
<br>This is a tremendous statement about being judgemental toward not only the adulterous woman, but all sinners. Jesus said that only the sinless were worthy of casting the first stone.<br>
While we as Christians cannot condone sin we are not to be so quick to pass judgement, that is God's role, not ours. We are to show forgiveness and compassion. This is not easy, but is an example of how the Church is suppose to operate.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"And again He stooped down and wrote on the ground. Then those who heard it, being convicted by their conscience, went out one by one, beginning with the oldest even to the last. And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst" (John 8:8-9)</font><br>
So, with only the adulterous woman standing before Him, Jesus once again seemed to write something on the ground, and again we aren't told what it may have been.
Jesus had said that only the ones without sin could cast the first stone at the adulterous woman, so, beginning with the older ones, they all went away one by one.<br>
Don't you think they all knew they were in the wrong to start with and fell under conviction by the words and presence of Jesus. Maybe in the same way as the temple guards in Chapter seven who said "no man ever spoke like this before."<br>
Do you think the older men were wiser in Scripture, or perhaps more aware of their sins than the younger? Perhaps both?</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Jesus stood up and said to her, "When Jesus had raised Himself up and saw no one but the woman, He said to her, “Woman, where are those accusers of yours? Has no one condemned you?” She said, “No one, Lord.” And Jesus said to her, “Neither do I condemn you; go and sin no more.” (John 8:10-11)</font><br>
This is an example of how Jesus forgives all sin. He did not condemned the adulterous woman to death, nor did he say, that, since He had come, her adulterous deed was no longer a sin. On the contrary, He openly revealed her sin when He told her to "go, and sin no more."</p>
<p>
Jesus realised that based upon the Law of God this woman had committed a sin that required the death sentence. But Jesus, being God, had the authority to forgive this woman's sin, which He did.<br>
Still, the death sentence for this woman was a Commandment of God that had to be carried out, and not even Jesus could break the Commandments.<br>
So a short time later, (some think only a few days), Jesus died in her place on the cross totally fulfilling the requirements of the Law on her behalf.</p>
<p>
The adulterous woman's sin was forgiven by Almighty God, never to be remembered again. (Complete forgiveness and eternal life with Him).<br>What a wonderful plan and Saviour!<br>
Jesus not only died for the sins of this woman, but for all who will seek His Plan of Salvation. Even to this day we can receive complete forgiveness and eternal life, because, like the adulterous woman, His death on the cross fulfilled the Law on our behalf.</p>
