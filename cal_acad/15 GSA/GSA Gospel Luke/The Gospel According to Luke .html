The Gospel According to Luke 
</h1>
<p>
Luke’s Gospel features an introductory prologue typical of a historian in antiquity.<br> He writes,  <font color= "blue">“... it seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write to you an orderly account, most excellent Theophilus, that you may know the certainty of those things in which you were instructed.” (Luke 1:3–4)</font>. <br>Luke’s orderly account relies on eyewitnesses of Jesus and the earliest disciples, though he could not have been an eyewitness himself. The Gospel of Luke dates from between 75 and 85 A.D., around the same time as Matthew. <br>The author relies most likely on the Gospel of Mark and other stories circulating orally during his lifetime. Luke’s Greek is the polished work of a gifted literary artist, indicating that Luke was a cultivated, well-educated man.</p>
<h3>
Analysis
</h3>
<p>
Although the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke tell basically the same story, there are important differences between the Gospels that help identify the special interests of each author. A comparison of the different genealogies of Jesus offers a good example. In Matthew’s Gospel, Jesus’ family lineage is traced back through important Jewish families, culminating with Abraham, the father of the Jewish people. This line of descent fits well with Matthew’s emphasis on Jesus’ continuity with the Old Testament and the Jewish people.<br> In contrast, Luke’s genealogy downplays Judaic roots and traces Jesus’ parentage to Adam, the universal man of the Old Testament. <br>Luke’s emphasis on Jesus’ common humanity gives scholars reason to think that Luke could have been a learned Gentile speaking to a largely Gentile audience. Although he may have been in a non-Jewish community, Luke was a meticulous historian and a learned man, who would have known some of the more widely circulating stories of the Jews, such as the story of Adam and Eve. <br>Luke had to make sense of the fact that Jesus was indeed a Jew, and he would have been compelled to take into account some kind of Jewish heritage, so he chose to emphasise that which would be the most universal and inclusive of Gentiles. Likewise, other characteristics of Luke’s account make comparatively few references to the Old Testament, which would have been strange and perhaps even unknown to his largely Gentile audience.</p>
<h3>
Miracles and Healing
</h3>
<p>
In the earliest parts of his Gospel, Luke tells many of the same miracle and healing stories contained in Mark, describing Jesus healing a leper, announcing the forgiveness of sins, and restoring life to the widow’s son.<br> Like Matthew, Luke deviates from Mark’s Gospel and includes what he calls the Sermon on the Plain, which is Luke’s equivalent to Matthew’s description of the Sermon on the Mount. Luke is persistently concerned for the poor and the outcast, and his description of Jesus’ sermon includes a series of warnings to the rich, fat, and mirthful (Luke 6:24–26).<br> Luke 7 introduces further incidents of Jesus’ ministry in Galilee that are distinct from both Matthew and Mark and give us an indication of Luke’s special interests: the faith of the Centurion’s slave emphasises and encourages the faith of a Gentile (Luke 7:1–10); the healing of the Widow’s Son demonstrates Jesus’ concern for a widow (Luke 7:11–17). <br>The Ministering Woman in Luke 8 stresses Jesus readiness to help and be helped by women. Luke returns to Mark’s Gospel for the subsequent miracles and healing stories.</p>
<h3>
The Journey to Jerusalem
</h3>
<p>
The next Lucan section, “The Journey to Jerusalem,” is the Gospel’s longest, most loosely organised section (Luke 9.51–19:27). In this section, the narrative begins to move toward Jerusalem for the crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension—the ascension being the central event of Luke’s Gospel. <br>Contained in this section are some of the most well known parables in the entire New Testament, found only in Luke. These include the story of the Good Samaritan, a parable that reflects Luke’s interest in Jesus’ boundary-breaking behaviour in associating with outcasts such as the Samaritans, a community once despised by Jews. Luke also includes a unique parable about Mary and Martha in which Jesus praises Mary, the female disciple who neglects her chores to listen to Jesus, and gently reproaches Martha, who is preoccupied by the traditional domestic duties of a woman. Also included are other well-known parables, such as those about the mustard seed and the rich fool storing his excess grain, and lessons on prayer, discipleship, and devotion—all of which stress the dangers of wealth and the importance of devotion to Jesus’ way.</p>
<h3>
Parables
</h3>
<p>
Luke 15 is considered one of the greatest chapters of the New Testament.<br> In it, Luke depicts three separate parables about being lost.<br> The parable about the lost sheep among the ninety-nine found shows God’s unending concern for the lost.<br> The parable of the lost coin is similar, as is the famous story of the prodigal son, who is lost from his family and the standards of his father. The sheep, coin, and son are all found and returned to loving hands in their rightful places, which Luke uses to represent God’s love and concern for the lost and forgotten. <br>The loving concern exhibited toward these characters reflects the concern shown by Jesus, which the disciple must strive to emulate.</p>
<h3>
The Women and the Poor
</h3>
<p>
At a time in which most women were excluded from participating in public life in Rome, and were considered ritually impure for a substantial portion of their life according to Jewish custom, Luke’s special concern for women and other outcasts of society is truly remarkable. His concern gives historians reason to think that there must have been a significant number of prominent female converts in Luke’s community. Luke praises the courage of Mary, who rejoices over her fate to conceive the Son of God. From Luke, we also learn a bit more about Mary Magdalene, one of Jesus’ closest disciples, who follows him to the tomb and is among the first to see that Jesus’ body is missing.<br> Luke tells us that Mary Magdalene was just one of many woman who travels with Jesus and his male disciples in an age when the mixing of sexes was virtually unheard of.<br> Luke also tells us that these courageous women <font color= "blue">“provided for Him from their substance.” (Luke 8:3)</font>. <br>In other words, women in the Gospel of Luke are largely responsible for the finances of Jesus’ followers. In Acts, Luke describes Lydia, the wealthy merchant who provides for Paul, along with Priscilla, Aquila, and Philip’s four daughters, who are prophetesses (Luke 21:9).</p>
<p>
Along with his concern and esteem for women, Luke also shows preferential concern for the poor and the outcast. He repeatedly insists on the dangers of wealth <font color= "blue">and He said to them, "Take heed and beware of covetousness, for one's life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses. (Luke 12:15)</font>. These words must have been shocking to urban Gentile ears in a society in which the overwhelming majority of the population was destitute, impoverished, and enslaved—but now, suddenly, according to Jesus, blessed.</p> 
<h3>
Concessions and Accusations
</h3>
<p>
While Luke takes great risks in his patriarchal, hierarchical, and divisive society with his shocking words of inclusion and universalism, he also makes concessions. Luke’s Gospel and Acts of the Apostles are the most pro-Roman works of the New Testament. Luke is insistent on maintaining Pontius Pilate’s innocence in the crucifixion of the Jews and places all guilt in the hands of the Jewish leaders. In Acts, during the stoning of Stephen, Stephen says to a violent Jewish mob in Jerusalem,<font color= "blue"> “You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears! You always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, so do you. Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who foretold the coming of the Just One, of whom you now have become the betrayers and murderers,” (Acts 7:51–52)</font>.</p>
<p>
Such loaded rhetoric is generally viewed as Luke’s attempt to persuade the Roman officials that the Christian Church, rapidly growing in Gentile converts, was no threat to the Roman Empire. This minority community wanted to appear on the side of the Romans so as to give the empire, whose disregard for human life has been nearly unrivalled in world history, no reason to pay them any heed or to regard them as a threat.<br> The stories in Luke and Acts are politically structured to put all blame on the Jews, who were already a suspicious group with an alternative lifestyle to that of the Greco-Roman Empire, with its Greek philosophy and Roman Gods. <br>This finger-pointing has indicated to historians that by the time of Luke, Christianity had become much more Gentile and less Jewish in its identity.</p>
