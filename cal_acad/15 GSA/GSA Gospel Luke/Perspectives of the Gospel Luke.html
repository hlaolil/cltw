   <h1>
Perspectives of the Gospel Luke
</h1>
<p>
This Gospel was first dedicated to Theophilus, a senior official in Rome, and afterwards distributed in Antioch among a predominantly non-Jewish community. <br>Events in this Gospel are discussed in a chronological order, while Matthew arranged the information according to the subjects concerned.</p>
<p>
To Luke, the Gospel message has a much more universal application as it is meant for all people regardless of their nationality or class. <br>He does not deny the Jewish context of the Gospel but explicitly indicates the world-wide objectives of preaching the Gospel message. That is the reason why Luke does not offer a Jewish genealogy for Jesus, as in Matthew where His descent is only reckoned back to Abraham, but traces it back to Adam.<br> Christ, therefore, addresses all the descendants of Adam and not only the lost sheep of the house of Israel who are the descendants of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. He became man for all of us:<br> <font color= "blue">“for the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost”<br> (Luke 19:10)</font>.</p>
<p>
This approach is evident from the parable of the Good Samaritan <br>(Luke 10:25-37) and also from the rebuking of the Jews because of their intolerance towards the Samaritans (Luke 9:51-56). <br>In this Gospel, Jewish people were reproached by the Lord Jesus since nine of the ten lepers whom He healed, all nine Jews, acted ungratefully by not returning to thank or follow Jesus. Only the tenth one, a Samaritan, turned back to glorify God (Luke 17:11-19). <br>In Luke 10, seventy disciples were sent out to proclaim the Gospel to Jews and Gentiles. Matthew did not record this incident as the assignment of the 70 was not only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</p>
<p>
In his prophetic review, Luke not only discusses the fate of the unbelieving Jewish people but he also records prophecies related to the Messianic believers, the non-Jewish Christians and the nations. The first generation escape of Messianic believers from the destruction of Jerusalem, which had been promised by Jesus, is described by Luke (Luke 21:20-22) but not by Matthew.<br> Luke then goes on to mention <font color= "blue">“the times of the Gentiles” (Luke 21:24)</font> which would elapse from the first generation until late in the last generation of the present dispensation. This period was not even mentioned by Matthew as he confined himself to the divine history of Israel (the same approach was followed by the prophet, Daniel, who gave no indication of the long break between the 69th and 70th year-weeks in his prophecy on Israel – Dan 9:24-27).</p>
<p>
The restoration of Jerusalem would mark the end of the times of the Gentiles as Jerusalem would be trampled by the Gentiles <font color= "blue">“until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled” (Luke 21:24)</font>.<br> Luke then proceeds to describe a period of world-wide distress among the nations, leading up to the Second Coming of Christ (Luke 21:25-27).<br> The great tribulation is not discussed in any detail by Luke – neither does he mention the flight of the Jews after the desecration of the temple in the middle of the week, as Matthew has done. Luke only summarises the great anxiety and cosmic signs of the tribulation period and then offers a sure way to escape it: <font color= "blue">“Watch therefore and pray always that you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man” <br>(Luke 21:36)</font>.<br>Matthew did not make mention of this promise of escaping the tribulation since the Jewish people, as a nation, will have to pass through the time of Jacob’s trouble because of their spiritual blindness.</p>
<p>
From the different perspectives adopted by Luke and Matthew it is very clear that the promise of escaping the tribulation period is only made to the disciples of Jesus by Luke (Luke 21:36). Furthermore, it is obvious that His disciples in the end-time would be mainly non-Jewish (Luke 24:47). They are encouraged to live vigilant lives so that they may be worthy to escape the coming tribulation by being removed to the blessed presence of the Son of Man. <br>This title of Christ (the Son of Man) is used more often in Luke and alludes to His position as God-Man for the salvation of all who believe in the human family.</p>
<p>
By promising an escape route to both first generation and last generation believers (Luke 21:20-21,36), Jesus confirms the fact that believers are never judged with unbelievers. As in the days of Noah and Lot, believers must first be removed from disaster area of divine judgements before the wrath of God is poured out upon the wicked.</p>
<h3>
A Final Comparison
</h3>
<p><font size="+1">
In Matthew</font></p>
<p>
A further striking feature of the presentation of the prophetic message is that Jerusalem (of which the inhabitants represent the core-group of the unbelieving Jewish nation) is addressed in the first person with a message that directly concerns the Jews. In proclaiming first generation prophecies, Jesus said:<br><font color= "blue">“O Jerusalem, Jerusalem ... how often I wanted to gather your children ... but you were not willing! See, your house is left to you desolate” (Matt 23:37-38)</font>. The same approach is followed in last generation prophecies:<br> <font color= "blue">“When you see the abomination of desolation (the false messiah desecrating the temple)... flee to the mountains ... Then if anyone says to you, Look, here is the Christ! [Messiah] or There! do not believe it” (Matt 24:15-16,23)</font>.<br> During the subsequent coming of the Son of Man, all the tribes (nations) of the world will mourn (Matt 24:29-30). In this way the Jews are told that not only they will mourn for Him whom they have pierced (see Zech 12:10), but the remnant of the Christ-rejecting nations will do the same.<br> Nevertheless, the primary message in these prophecies is directed to Israel.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
In Luke</font></p>
<p> 
The prophetic message is not addressed to the Jewish nation in the first person, but to the disciples of Jesus (whether Jew or Gentile). In connection with the first generation destruction of Jerusalem, Jesus said to His disciples:<br> <font color= "blue">“When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is near” (Luke 21:20)</font>.<br>All references to Jerusalem and its inhabitants are made by Luke in the third person. Even the Gentiles, who are explicitly included in the prophetic scenario, are referred to in the third person as Jesus communicates information about them to His disciples. The Messianic (Jewish) believers are told that their persecution by orthodox Jews will begin before the tribulation period:<br> <font color= "blue">“But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons” (Luke 21:12)</font>. <br>In reviewing the major signs of the tribulation period, Luke does not single out Israel but mentions all the nations:<br><font color= "blue"> “And there will be signs in the sun, in the moon, and in the stars; and on the earth distress of nations, with perplexity ... men’s hearts failing them from fear and the expectation of those things which are coming on the earth, for the powers of heaven will be shaken” (Luke 21:25-26)</font>. <br>But the true disciples of Jesus are assured, in the first person, that: <br><font color= "blue">“you may be counted worthy to escape all these things that will come to pass, and to stand before the Son of Man” (Luke 21:36)</font>. <br>This is definitely not a message to Israel, but to the end-time disciples of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>
The end-time scenario is clearly linked to the end of Jerusalem’s trampling by the Gentiles:<br><font color= "blue"> “Jerusalem will be trampled by Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled” (Luke 21:24)</font>.<br> It needs to be indicated here that biblical Jerusalem (the Old City, also referred to as the City of David) was physically recaptured by Israel in June 1967 during the Six Day War, while its political restoration to its former status as capital of Israel occurred in August 1980. These events ushered in the end-time generation before the Second Coming of Christ (Matt 24:34; Luke 21:32).</p>
<p>
Taking into account the different prophetic perspectives in Matthew and Luke, the parameters of the two critical generations in the present dispensation between the first and second comings of Jesus are as follows:</p>
<p><font size="+1">
The First Generation</font></p>
<p>
This generation started with the rejection and crucifixion of Jesus as Israel’s Messiah-King and ended with the siege and destruction of Jerusalem. <br>The big war by a Roman army caused the death of many Jews in Jerusalem, while the surviving remnant of the inhabitants were taken as captives of war and became dispersed to other nations. During the first generation, Israel and the church coexisted but Israel was gradually phased out as a vehicle for world evangelism due to their rejection of the Messiah, and the church was phased in to fulfil the assignment of evangelising the world.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
The Times of the Gentiles</font></p>
<p> 
The long period between the first and last generations is described as “the times of the Gentiles” (Luke 21:24). During this period the entire non-Jewish world (including the dispersed Jews) would get the opportunity to become members of the kingdom of God by accepting Jesus as their Messiah and Redeemer and be born again (Matt 28:18-20; Luke 24:45-49).</p>
<p><font size="+1">
The Last Generation</font></p>
<p>
This generation started with the recapture and political restoration of Jerusalem by the restored people of Israel. During this generation the church and Israel will initially co-exist, but before its final seven years (the 70th week of Daniel) the church will be phased out by way of the rapture (Luke 21:36) and Israel as a nation gradually phased in as the spiritually restored people of God.<br> The first phase of their spiritual restoration will be the salvation of 144 000 Jews early in the tribulation period, soon after the rapture, while the whole remnant will be saved at the end of the tribulation period when the Messiah returns to Jerusalem (see Zech 14:4-5).<br> On that day, the remnant of Israel will say to Him:<font color= "blue"> “Blessed is He who comes in the Name of the Lord!” (Matt 23:39; see also Zech 12:10; 13:1,9)</font>.</p>
<p>
In connection with the last generation escape of believers (Luke 21:34-36) Proff. Walvoorrd & Zuck (The Bible Knowledge Commentary, p. 258) say:<br> “Jesus warned His disciples to be ready at all times. Though a believer will be able to anticipate the coming of the kingdom by the signs, it is possible to get so entangled with the affairs of life that some will not be ready for the kingdom when it comes – unexpectedly (Luke 21:34) and universally (Luke 21:35).  <br>It was against this wrong attitude that Jesus said, <br><font color= "blue">"Be careful" (Luke 21:34)</font> and <font color= "blue">"be always on the watch" (Luke 21:36)</font>.” <br>The universal nature of the catastrophes of the tribulation is mentioned in <br>Luke 21:25 where it is plainly stated that on the (whole) earth there will be distress of nations, while Jesus says that the sudden coming of the day of the Lord will affect all people on earth: <br><font color= "blue">“For it will come as a snare on all those who dwell on the face of the whole earth.” (Luke 21:35)</font> <br>When the heavenly Bridegroom suddenly and unexpectedly takes His bride away, the false messiah will be revealed and the wrath of God poured out over all the inhabitants of the earth. It is in view of these coming events that we must watch and pray that we may be worthy to escape all these things that will come to pass (the worst tribulation and suffering known to mankind) and to stand in the wonderful presence of the Son of Man in heavenly places.</p>
