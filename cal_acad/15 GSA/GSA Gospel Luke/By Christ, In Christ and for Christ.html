Catching Men for Christ
</h2>
<p>
The greatest purpose we can have in life is to follow Jesus in catching men for Him.</p>
<p>
Picture the scene: The multitudes were pressing around Jesus, listening to the word of God. And where were Peter, James and John? They were involved with their business, cleaning their nets after a frustrating night of fishing with no catch. And so Jesus’ job was to get their eyes off of fish and onto Himself and lost people. Jesus was “designing Himself ... to take the fishermen in His net”  The first lesson is:</p>
<p><font size="+1">
To Catch Men for Christ</font></p> 
<p>
We must shift our focus from success in business to success in catching people for the Savior's business.</p>
<p>
There is nothing wrong with success in business, per se. God wants us to be diligent and to do well in our work. It is not more spiritual to be mediocre in our jobs and it is not inherently more worldly to become successful. Also, when I say that we must shift our focus from success in business to success in catching people for Christ, I am not implying that everyone must leave so-called “secular” employment and work full-time in the gospel. Some are called to do that, as Peter was, but certainly not all. It is not more spiritual to be in full-time ministry than it is to be a faithful servant of the Lord in some other kind of work. <br>It is just a matter of gifts and calling.</p>
<p>
But, having said all that, I do insist that if you are a follower of Jesus Christ, you must adopt His purpose for your life, and His primary purpose for His children never involves becoming a success in our jobs. <br>His word to all of us is, <font color= "blue">“Do not lay up for yourselves treasures upon earth, ...”</font> but rather, <font color= "blue">“seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness ...” <br>(Matt 6:19,33)</font>.<br> Whatever you do to make a living, your main goal should be to glorify God and your main focus should be to be a witness for Jesus Christ through your behaviour, your attitudes, and your words. This requires a shift in focus where you begin to view people as Jesus did and to view yourself as His representative in your sphere of influence.<br> The people you come in contact with are your mission field.</p>
<p>
These fishermen just had what was probably the most successful catch of their careers. The two boatloads of fish probably would have brought in a handsome profit at the local market. Like a miner who finally finds some gold, this successful catch probably whet their appetites to go back out and try for more. They easily could have thought, “Wow, if this keeps up, we could get rich!” <br>But because Jesus clearly stated a new focus for them, we read instead,<br> <font color= "blue">"when they had brought their boats to land, they forsook all and followed Him" (Luke 5:11)</font>.<br> Things changed from this moment because of what Jesus did and said.<br> Catching fish did not compare to following Jesus and catching men. <br>Christ and His purpose had now captivated them.</p>
<p>
So my question is, “Are you living for Christ’s purpose for your life?” <br>As I said, this does not mean that you must be gifted in evangelism or that you must go into full-time ministry. Only some are called to do that. <br>But it does mean that because you have met Jesus Christ as your Saviour and Lord, your life is not your own. You no longer are living for selfish purposes. <br>You live to glorify Jesus Christ and to use the gifts He has given you to help in the great cause of catching people for Him.</p>
<p>
It means that at the end of your life, you will not measure success by whether you have accumulated a lot of money or by how high you have climbed on the corporate ladder. You will measure your life by whether you have faithfully used what God has entrusted to you to further His kingdom. Whether directly through your verbal witness or indirectly through your example, your giving, your good works, your service, or whatever, there will be people in heaven because you did not live for yourself, but for Jesus Christ and His kingdom. We have to make this fundamental shift in focus if we want to be used in catching people for Jesus Christ.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
To Catch Men for Christ </font></p> 
<p>
We must Obey the Sovereign Authority of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>
First, Jesus gets into Peter’s boat and asks him to put out a little way from the land so that He can teach the crowd without them pressing against Him. <br>Then, when He has finished teaching, Jesus directly commands Peter to put out into the deep and let down the nets for a catch. Here is a carpenter telling a professional fisherman how to do his job! Peter knew that the best time to fish was at night and that he had just fished all night to no avail. <br>But, after registering his brief protest, Peter quickly added,<br><font color= "blue"> “nevertheless at Your word I will let down the net.” (Luke 5:5)</font>.<br> His obedience resulted in miraculous success.</p>
<p>
Because of Jesus’ words about catching men, we are warranted in viewing this miracle as a lesson on evangelism.</p>
<h2 align="center">
Evangelism
</h2>
<h3>
The Message of Evangelism is Founded on God’s Word
</h3>
<p>
In Luke 5:1-3, Jesus is preaching the word of God to the crowd, and His message is focused on the kingdom of God, the realm where God is sovereign and people are subject to Him. The fact that His message is called “the word of God” means that it comes from God as its source. The word Jesus preached originated with God and therefore had God’s authority.<br> As Jesus said, <font color= "blue">“I do nothing of Myself; but as My Father taught Me, I speak these things” (John 8:28)</font>.</p>
<p>
When we talk to people about the gospel, we simply have to tell them what God has revealed about Himself, about the Saviour, and about our need for Him. Witnesses don’t make up their own stories. Witnesses are under oath to tell the truth about what they have seen and heard. The Bible is God’s Word to us through His faithful witnesses. Our job, like that of the apostles, is to tell what God has done through His Son Jesus.</p>
<p>
So if you want to be more effective in evangelism, get into the Word so that you are clear about the gospel. You must understand and be able to show people what Scripture says about concepts like sin, judgement, Christ’s substitutionary death, God’s grace, and saving faith in Jesus Christ. Not every Christian is a preacher, but every Christian is a witness. To be an obedient witness, you must learn the basics of the good news.</p>
<h3>
The Initiative for Evangelism Comes from the Lord
</h3>
<p>
It is clear that Jesus took the initiative in turning these fishermen into fishers of men. Peter, James, and John weren’t sitting out in their boats one day when one of them got the brainstorm, “Hey, we ought to become evangelists!” <br>That was probably the furthest thing from their minds. But the Lord had different plans and His plans prevailed.</p>
<p>
You may be thinking, “This message does not relate in any way to me.<br>I am not an evangelist and I never will be.” As I said, it may be true that you aren’t gifted in evangelism and that you aren’t called to do evangelism full time. But, it is God’s will that you adopt His purpose as your purpose, and it is clear from this text that the Lord’s purpose involves taking ordinary people like these fishermen and turning them into His agents for catching other people for God. Jesus stated His purpose, <font color= "blue">“For the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost.” (Luke 19:10)</font> <br>If we claim to be His followers, but we don’t have a heart for reaching the lost, we are not in line with His purpose.</p>
<p>
When we do get involved in reaching the lost, we have the assurance that the Lord goes before us. We don’t have to blaze our own trail. The Lord has sovereignly chosen a people before the foundation of the earth, and we are cooperating with His eternal purpose in taking the gospel to those whom He has chosen.<br> As Paul put it,<font color= "blue"> “Therefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.” <br>(2 Tim 2:10)</font>. <br>Since the initiative lies with the Lord, we can obey with confidence, knowing that He will use our witness for His eternal purpose.</p>
<h3>
The Guidance we Need in Evangelism Comes from the Lord.
</h3>
<p>
The Lord directed Peter the fisherman as to where he ought to cast his nets!<br> We don’t know whether this was a miracle of the Lord’s omniscience, in that He knew where the fish were at, or whether He commanded the fish to this spot and they obeyed. But clearly, Jesus was giving the orders and when Peter obeyed, he got these miraculous results. If we aren’t sure what to do to reach out to lost people, we need to pray, “Lord, show us where the fish are that You want us to catch, and we’ll cast the nets there.”</p>
<h3>
The Results in Evangelism Come from the Lord
</h3>
<p>
On this occasion, Peter got almost more fish than he could handle—the nets began to break and the boats began to sink! On the Day of Pentecost, the same thing happened spiritually, as Peter preached and 3,000 trusted in Christ. <br>On another occasion, the Lord directed Peter to the house of Cornelius, and before Peter even finished his sermon, the whole group had responded!<br> But whatever results we see or do not see, we need to keep in mind Paul’s words, <font color= "blue">“I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase” (1 Cor 3:6)</font>. While we should try to become more effective in presenting the gospel, we need to remember that true conversion comes from God alone. It’s possible to get decisions through slick methods of salesmanship, but we can only see conversions when God imparts new life through His Spirit.</p>
<p>
So, the message of evangelism is founded on God’s Word. <br>The initiative, the guidance, and the results in evangelism all come from the Lord. So, we don’t have to do anything, right? Wrong!</p>
<h3>
The Obedience We Need in Evangelism lies with Us
</h3>
<p>
If Peter had not obeyed by putting out into the deep and letting down the nets in obedience to the Lord, this miracle would not have happened. The Lord could have made all the fish swim to shore and jump into Peter’s boat, but He didn’t do that. Peter had to obey and then the Lord did this miracle.</p>
<p>
At first, Peter voiced his objections as to why it wouldn’t work.<br> Thankfully, he quickly added, “But at Your bidding ...” But, like Peter, it’s easy to come up with a hundred reasons why we can’t do what the Lord has told us to do. Sometimes His commands may strike us as kind of screwy, as this command must have struck Peter. But, like Peter, we need to set aside our reasons why it won’t work and obey the Lord in seeking to bring people into His gospel net. <br>Just let down the net of the gospel in obedience, and let the Lord bring the fish into it.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
To Catch Men for Christ</font></p> 
<p> 
We must shift our focus from success in business to success in the gospel.<br> And, we must learn to obey the Lord’s sovereign authority when He tells us to bear witness of His good news.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
To Catch Men for Christ</font></p> 
<p> 
We must grow in our understanding of who He is and of who we are.</p>
<p>
Peter had already had much contact with Jesus. He had seen Him do miracles, including the mass healings at his own door in Capernaum. But this miracle, affecting his personal trade, hit home in a way the others had not.<br> Suddenly Peter saw Jesus in a new light and at the same moment, was overwhelmed with his own sinfulness. Invariably, the most effective witnesses are those who have an exalted view of the Lord Jesus Christ and who are painfully aware of their own unworthiness to be His witnesses.</p>
<h3>
We Must Grow 
</h3>
<p>
In our understanding of Jesus as the powerful, holy, and gracious Lord.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Jesus is the Powerful Lord</font></p> 
<p>  
Although this miracle did not alter any physical laws of nature, it does reveal the power of the Lord Jesus over nature. The key that shows Christ’s power is Peter’s phrase, “at Your word” (Luke 5:5). What word is that? Scripture declares that God created the heavens and earth by His word (Gen 1:3 ff.; Heb. 11:3). <br>It also declares that Jesus <font color= "blue">“upholds all things by the word of His power” <br>(Heb 1:3)</font>.<br> At His word kingdoms rise and fall. And, it is the word of His gospel that is <font color= "blue">“power of God to salvation for everyone who believes,” (Rom 1:16)</font>. <br>Salvation is not a human self-help program. It requires God imparting a new heart and new life to those who were dead in their sins. The work of evangelism does not depend on our feeble powers of persuasion, but on God’s mighty working in the hearts of sinners.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Jesus is the Holy Lord</font></p> 
<p>
When Peter saw Jesus’ mighty power, he was instantly overwhelmed with Jesus’ holiness in contrast with his own sinfulness. A more logical prayer would have been, “Don’t depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!” But Peter wasn’t being logical here. <br>He was expressing what Isaiah felt when he got a glimpse of the holiness of the Lord and cried out, <font color= "blue">“Woe is me, for I am undone! Because I am a man of unclean lips, dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts” (Isa 6:5)</font>. <br>People today, first God’s people, but then those who do not know Him, need a fresh vision of the absolute holiness of the Lord. Such a vision shows us our desperate need and our own inadequacy to meet that need. Thus, casting off any perceived goodness of our own, we will cast ourselves completely on God’s abundant mercy.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Jesus is the Gracious Lord</font></p> 
<p>
Note the Lord’s gracious reply to Peter: “Do not fear, from now on you will be catching men.” Jesus’ words, “from now on” are great words of hope for us all! Maybe you’ve failed miserably. Perhaps you are overwhelmed by your own sinfulness. Fall before Jesus as Peter did and confess it to Him and you will hear His gracious words, “from now on.” He is the gracious Lord of new beginnings for those who repent. To catch men for Christ, we must grow in our understanding of who He is, the powerful, holy, and gracious Lord.</p>
<h3>
Transformed by His Grace
</h3>
<p>
We must grow in our understanding of ourselves as sinners who do not deserve His grace, but who are transformed by it.</p>
<p>
Peter’s recognition of his own sinfulness did not disqualify him from catching men for Christ; rather, it qualified him. If you think that you have it together well enough that you’re qualified to serve the Lord, you are not qualified to serve Him! The Lord calls into His service those who are constantly, painfully aware of their own sinfulness and weakness, because they are the only ones who are also constantly aware of their need to rely totally on Him. <br>Even the apostle Paul, when speaking of the gospel ministry, lamented,<br><font color= "blue"> “Who is sufficient for these things?”</font> Then he answered his own question,<br> <font color= "blue">“Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think of anything as being from ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God,” (2 Cor 2:16;3:5)</font>.</p>
<p>
It is the transforming grace of God in Christ that qualifies us and motivates us to reach out to others with the gospel. <br>It was Paul’s recognition of himself as the chief of sinners that drove him to preach the gospel (1 Tim 1:15; 1 Cor 15:9,10). <br>If you know the depravity of your own heart, but you also know the abundant grace of the Lord Jesus, then you will go out as a beggar who has found bread to tell other beggars where they can find the same.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
To Catch Men for Christ</font></p> 
<p> 
We must work together with other transformed sinners.</p>
<p>
Peter had to call his comrades to come and help him pull in the great catch of fish (Luke 5:7). He couldn’t do it alone. And in the work of catching men alive for Christ, we don’t work alone. It’s always a joy when I hear of someone who trusted Christ through my preaching. But, invariably, I also hear that someone else in the body has been praying for that person and witnessing to him or her. We work together to bring in the catch, but behind it all, we are not responsible for the catch. The Lord is! We work together, but the Lord gets the credit and glory.</p>
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
Is the thing that captivates your life your business or the Lord’s business?<br> Are you focused on catching fish or on catching men? 
While it sounds ridiculous, it’s easy to do. Gradually, your focus shifts from the Lord’s purpose of catching people in the gospel net to your business, whatever it may be. I pray that the Lord will use this message to show us all that the greatest purpose we can have in life is to follow Jesus in catching men alive for Him. I pray that each of us will go out into our respective mission fields armed with that purpose, and that the Lord will be pleased to give us a miraculous catch of men and women and young people for His kingdom!</p>
