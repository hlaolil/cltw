<h3>
Patched Garments
</h3>
<p>
Now, as He often did, Jesus uses an incident of the Pharisees' criticism as the occasion for teaching. The Pharisees and scribes are insisting that Jesus conform to their traditions. Jesus speaks in parables to explain -- especially for His disciples benefit, I believe -- why it is important that He doesn't fit His new teaching into their mould. First, He uses the metaphor of patched garments:
<font color= "blue">
"No one puts a piece from a new garment on an old one; otherwise the new makes a tear, and also the piece that was taken out of the new does not match the old." (Luke 5:36)</font>

Notice the deliberate contrast here between the old and the new? That's the point of the parable. Jesus is saying that to try to attach the new to the old not only results in destruction of the new ("he will have torn the new garment"), but also the old, which won't look right and will eventually tear again. He makes the same point with a parable about new wine and old.</p>
<h3>
Wine making and Wine skins
</h3>
<p>
The image of wine skins that Jesus uses in His parable is foreign to our culture. The only leather wine container we can imagine is the tear-shaped leather bota that Spaniards use to carry wine and squirt it into their mouth. But that is very unlike the wineskin Jesus refers to.</p>
<p>
Wine was made by treading barefoot on the grapes in a wine press, a square or circular pit hewn out of the rock, or dug out and lined with rocks and sealed with plaster. (See Isa 63:2-3; Job 24:11b; Lam 1:15; Joel 3:13; Matt 21:33; Rev 14:19-20; 19:15, where treading the wine press was a symbol of judgement.) The juice then flowed through a channel into a lower vessel, a wine vat which functioned as a collecting and fermenting container for the grape juice or must.</p>
<p>
In the warm climate of Palestine, grape juice began to ferment very quickly and there was no easy way to prevent fermentation. After the first state of fermentation had taken place in the wine vat, the wine was separated from the lees (that is, sediment of dead yeast, tartar crystals, small fragments of grape skins, etc.) and strained through a sieve or piece of cloth (cf. Matt 23:24). After four to six days it was poured into clay jars lined with pitch (called amphorae in Greece, e.g. Jer 48:11) or animal skins for storage and further fermentation.</p>
<p>
Wine skins were made of whole tanned goatskins where the legs and tail were cut off and had been sealed (1 Sam 1:24; 10:3; 16:20; 25:18; 2 Sam 16:1). In the Old Testament, the Hebrew word nebel, "skin-bottle, skin," is translated by the KJV as "bottle" which gives us images of glass wine bottles. But these were rather whole goatskins, with nubbins bulging out where the legs once were, the neck tied off where the wine has been poured in, the whole large skin bulging almost to bursting as the carbon dioxide gas generated by the fermentation process stretches it to its limit. This image is well described by Job:
<font color= "blue">
"For I am full of words; the spirit within me compels me. Indeed my belly is like wine that has no vent; it is ready to burst like new wine skins." (Job 32:18-19)</font>
Fermentation in the wineskin might continue for another two to four months until the process slows down and stops. By that time the skin has been stretched to its limit. The alcohol is probably about 12%, and the collagen protein that gives the leather its stretching ability has been stretched out, and probably denatured by the alcohol, destroying its natural resiliency. The skin's ability to contract and stretch again has been lost.</p>
<h3>
New Wine in Old Wine skins 
</h3>
<p>
While we aren't familiar with the details of wine skins, Jesus' hearers are. He didn't have to explain fermentation and the ageing of leather. They know what He means.
<font color= "blue">
"And no one puts new wine into old wine skins; or else the new wine will burst the wine skins and be spilled, and the wine skins will be ruined. But new wine must be put into new wine skins, and both are preserved" (Luke 5:37-38)</font>
Here's the same contrast of old and new that we saw in the parable of the patched garment. His point was the same: you can't join the new to the old or you'll ruin both the new wine and the old skin. The gas pressure from the fermentation is eventually so great that the inflexible old skin ruptures, and the new wine gushes out onto the ground and is wasted. His hearers all know not to use old skins with new wine. They understood.</p>
<h3>
The Old Is Better (5:39)
</h3>
<p>
But why talk about the contrast between old and new? What is new that would be ruined by being attached to the old? What's he getting at?</p>
<p>
Jesus has come with a radical gospel of Good News to the poor, the disenfranchised, the oppressed, the sick, the broken hearted (Luke 4:18-19). He speaks with authority, rather than the casuistry of the scribes of His day. Their man-made rules of who He can eat with and how He should fast would just get in the way. They are externals, that is all. Jesus, on the other hand, is aiming to expose afresh the heart of the ancient faith. He helps them to return anew to love for God and for one's neighbour, to do mercy and love justice and walk humbly with their God. These are the core of the Hebrew faith -- its life, not the dead Pharisaical external traditions that offer an appearance of piety but don't change the heart (see Col 2:23).</p>
<p>
You may think that this is a dead issue, but it has a way of raising its head again and again. Paul, trained as a strict Pharisee, grasps the radical nature of salvation by grace through faith, and goes preaching it boldly throughout the Mediterranean. Soon he is called on the carpet to explain why he isn't imposing the familiar Jewish regulations on his Gentile converts (Acts 15). Again and again he has to insist that we are free in Christ, so we must not become entangled again in a legalistic religion trying to pass itself off as Christianity (see Gal 5, for example). The Judaisers try to infect church after church with their legalism; the recipients of the Letter to the Hebrews are tempted to turn again to the regulations of Judaism. Yes, legalism and an external faith are problems of every generation.</p>
<p>
Why is that so? At the close of His parable of the wine skins, Jesus puts it this way: <font color= "blue">"And no one, having drunk old wine, immediately desires new; for He says, "The old is better." (Luke 5:39)</font>. It is easier to fall back to what is familiar and comfortable, and justify that, rather than launch out into a life guided not by laws and regulations but led by the Voice of the Spirit of God. The two are opposites, the old and the new. You cannot combine them without destroying both.</p>
<p>
No, Jesus, insists, the Gospel of the Kingdom must not be hindered by the man-made rules of the Pharisees' religion. It must be free to work its power unfettered. The New Wine may not be as smooth to the tongue, and finely aged as old wine. It may be a bit sharp and unrefined. But it is alive. You can't contain it in old structures. You must find new wine skins for it or none at all.</p>
<h3>
Integrating the New with the Old
</h3>
<p>
That is not to say that Jesus' threw out the Old Covenant. He makes it very clear in the Sermon on the Mount that he comes to fulfil the Law, not to abrogate it:
<font color= "blue">
"Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfil. For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled.  Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven." (Matt 5:17-20)</font></p>
<p>
He doesn't come to set aside the law, but to strip away the Pharisees' precious oral tradition so people can see the power and spirit of the Law, and repent, preparing for the coming of the Kingdom. The Spirit Jesus sends now fulfils the law within us (Rom 8:1-4; Gal 5:16-23).</p>
<p>
Neither was Jesus always critical of the old. He tells His disciples,<font color= "blue"> "Therefore every scribe instructed concerning the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old." (Matt 13:52)</font></p>
<h3>
Pouring the Life of the Spirit into Your Life
</h3>
<p>
Having put Jesus' teaching in perspective, however, we must pause to grapple personally with the power of His words: "And no one puts new wine into old wine skins; or else the new wine will burst the wine skins and be spilled, and the wine skins will be ruined. But new wine must be put into new wine skins, and both are preserved".<br>
What are the structures of our own age and culture that cannot coexist with the new wine of the Spirit. What have we tried to sew Christianity onto that will cause a greater tear and undermine the faith itself. In Jesus' day it was the legalistic spirit of Pharisaism. What is it in your own life? What is it in your work, your community, your school, your environment?</p>
<p>
"New wine must be poured into new wine skins," not accommodated to those comfortable things in our lives with which it is basically incompatible. The message for disciples is to be uncompromising about our faith and the work of the Spirit in our lives. If our honoured customs and habits, and the structures of our society must adjust to that, then so be it.</p>
<h3>
Fickle Children 
</h3>
<p>
Now Jesus responds to the criticism that has been thrown at both John the Baptist and Jesus. He begins with an analogy to children playing in the market square, and sing-songing their childish songs:

"We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not cry. (Luke 7:31-32)
He may be quoting a saying which children of his day used when other children would not join their games. We called and you did not come. You didn't jump through the hoops we thought you should.<br>
But notice the saying has two parts: dancing and mourning, that are, I believe, intended to correspond to the differences between John and Jesus. John is the mourner who would not dance, while Jesus is the dancer who would not mourn.</p>
<h3>
Criticising John's Asceticism 
</h3>
<p>
John was criticised for his ascetic ways, his preference for locusts and wild honey rather than the bread and wine that others enjoyed. (Were the locusts dipped in honey before eating? :-)) You just can't please everybody -- ever. Great men are raked with scathing criticism and fools are praised. It was that way in Jesus' time, and it is that way in ours. If you and I are set on pleasing people in order to feel good about ourselves, we must be prepared for an emotional roller coaster. Rather than reacting to the whims of people's flute music and funeral dirges, we need to listen for "the beat of a different drummer," and tune our ear to his rhythms.</p>
<h3>
Criticising Jesus' Freedom to Enjoy the Company of Sinners 
</h3>
<p>
While John wasn't liberal enough for the critics, Jesus was too liberal. The critics weren't consistent. When asked why his disciples didn't fast like John's disciples, Jesus answered "Can you make the guests of the bridegroom fast while he is with them?" (Luke 5:33-35) Instead, Jesus and his disciples accepted invitations to dinners held in the wealthy homes of tax collectors, as well as Pharisees. They were just people caught in different kinds of sins and myopia. Jesus ate and drank with them because he loved them, pure and simple. He hoped that his love and presence in their homes would make a difference, that some of the things that he taught them around the dinner table would be remembered and change their lives. Indeed, his dinner conversations did change lives.</p>
<p>
Was Jesus a glutton? Of course not! Though he ate well and enjoyed his hosts' fare. Was Jesus a drunkard or winebibber? Of course not! Though he did drink his hosts' wine, and probably, as the Rabbi at the table, was asked to offer the traditional blessing upon it:

"Baruch Ata Adonai, Eloheinu Melech Ha-Olam...."
"Blessed are You, our God, King of the Universe,
Creator of the fruit of the vine."
His critics also tagged him as "a friend of tax collectors and 'sinners' " (7:34b). They meant it as a put-down, but Jesus wears it as a badge of honor. "Friend of sinners." Who else would be a friend to them -- a real friend? Who else would extend himself for sinners to the point of dying for their sins? No one. He was and is the friend of sinners. Thank God for that!</p>
<h3>
Wisdom's Vindication (7:35)
</h3>
<p>
Men are fickle in their praise and criticism. You'll never please them, and if you try -- if you are foolish enough to try -- you'll be grievously disillusioned. Jesus did not dance to their tune or jump their hoops. He was acclaimed by some and vilified by others. Yet it did not move him. John the Baptist did what he was called to do though it brought him prison and execution by beheading. Jesus did what he was called to do though it required of him death on a cross. "But wisdom is proved right by all her children."</p>
<p>
What does that mean? The children of wisdom are those who are wise and discerning people. The idea is that true wisdom is proved out by those who practice it. Those who have discerned that John and Jesus were of God will ultimately be vindicated in their choice. Their faith may be tested by hard times, but ultimately it will be shown up as the path of wisdom.</p>
