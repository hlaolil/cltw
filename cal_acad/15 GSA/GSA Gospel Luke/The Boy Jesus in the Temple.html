   <h1>
The Boy Jesus in the Temple
</h1>
<h3>
Infused with the Grace of God 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"So when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth. And the Child grew and became strong in spirit,[a] filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him." (Luke 2:40)</font></p>
<p>
Luke doesn't mention -- or perhaps isn't aware of -- the Holy Family's trip from Bethlehem to Egypt to escape the wrath of Herod the Great against Jesus <br>(Matt 2:13-23). Rather, Luke focuses on Jesus' gradual growth to maturity in Nazareth.</p>
<p>
Jesus grew, but did He learn? He didn't start out from infancy with all knowledge -- He had "emptied himself" of omniscience when He became a man (Phil 2:7). We humans learn as toddlers by observing, trial and error. We learn language by imitation and correction. We learn responsibility by parental rules and enforcement until those rules -- and eventually those values -- become internalised. Did Jesus learn this way, too? I expect so.</p>
<p>
Believing that Jesus learned like any other human child doesn't conflict with our belief in His sinlessness (2 Cor 5:21; Heb 7:26; 1 John 3:5).<br>

Though Jesus had to learn like the rest of us, He was specially gifted by God. This verse (Luke 2:40) tells us that He was "filled with wisdom" and that "the grace of God was upon Him" -- that is, God blessed Him in what He was doing.</p>
<h3>
Annual Trip to Jerusalem for Passover
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"His parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the Passover." <br>(Luke 2:41)</font><br>
Theoretically, Jewish men were required to go to three feasts in Jerusalem each year -- Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles -- though only the Passover was strictly observed. Those at some distance, especially the poor, could not attend all the feasts. But women -- and sometimes children -- might attend, too. Passover celebrated God delivering the people of Israel from slavery in Egypt, and pilgrims to the feast would stay a minimum of two days, sometimes longer.</p>
<h3>
Left Behind at 12 Years of Age 
</h3>
<p>
Jesus was twelve years old at this Passover, just on the brink of manhood. During a boy's twelfth year He was prepared for His induction as a full member of the religious community which took place when He was thirteen. <br>This year He is described as a "boy, youth, child, a young person normally below the age of puberty." Next year, as a man, Jesus would be required to attend Passover; this year He was learning what was involved. That doesn't mean, however, that He had never travelled to Jerusalem for Passover with His family. The scripture just doesn't say.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"And when He was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast. When they had finished the days, as they returned, the Boy Jesus lingered behind in Jerusalem. And Joseph and His mother did not know it; but supposing Him to have been in the company, they went a day’s journey, and sought Him among their relatives and acquaintances. So when they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking Him." (Luke 2:42-45)</font></p>
<p>
Pilgrims to the feast in Jerusalem usually travelled in a large party or caravan since a person travelling by himself was in danger from bandits who could swoop down on lone travellers. The caravan was made up of many of Mary and Joseph's friends and relatives from Galilee, and they naturally supposed that Jesus was somewhere in the crowd. No doubt when they camped for the night and Jesus was nowhere to be seen, they became alarmed. By this time they were probably 20 to 25 miles north of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>
First, they searched among the campers in their company.(Luke 2:44-45) <br>When they inquired and discovered that no one had seen Jesus, they returned to Jerusalem, probably leaving early the next morning and arriving in the city about nightfall.</p>
<h3>
Sitting Among the Teachers in the Temple 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Now so it was that after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions.<br> And all who heard Him were astonished at His understanding and answers." <br>(Luke 2:46-47)</font><br>
"After three days" probably means "on the third day" -- one day travelling north to Galilee by caravan, one day returning south to Jerusalem, and then the third day searching until they found Jesus.</p>
<p>
And where was He? Deeply engrossed in discussion with the learned teachers:<br>

The members of the Temple-Sanhedrin, who on ordinary days sat as a Court of Appeal, from the close of the Morning Sacrifice to the time of the Evening Sacrifice, were wont on Sabbaths and feast-days to come out upon 'the Terrace' of the Temple, and there to teach.<br>
Sometimes we hear this passage explained as if Jesus were teaching the teachers, but that misunderstands the context. The listeners would be sitting on the ground at the feet of the teachers, who were also seated. The rabbinical style of teaching used questions on the part of the students, from which discussion would arise.</p>
<p>
In the course of the discussion, this intense boy of twelve was both listening and asking probing, insightful questions that indicated to all His depth of understanding. Everyone who heard Jesus on this occasion was struck by His understanding. </p>
<p>
At age twelve, Jesus was listening to teaching in the temple during Passover. But 20 years or so later, He was the Teacher in these same courts, and His many, many hearers were still struck by His insight and authority.</p>
<h3>
Rebuked by His Mother 
</h3>
<p>
Jesus was so engaged when His parents finally spotted Him. They were beside themselves with worry, as any parents would be.<br>
<font color= "blue">
"So when they saw Him, they were amazed; and His mother said to Him, “Son, why have You done this to us? Look, Your father and I have sought You anxiously." (Luke 2:48)</font><br>
Luke describes Mary's and Joseph's reaction to finding Him among the teachers in the temple as being "amazed". </p>
<p>
But once Mary sees that Jesus is safe, her mother instinct takes over. She asks Him -- not too gently, I suppose -- "Why have You done this to us?" She interprets the event in terms of how it has worried and inconvenienced her and Joseph. </p>
<h3>
Jesus' Reply: My Father's House 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
 And He said to them, “Why did you seek Me? Did you not know that I must be about My Father’s business?” But they did not understand the statement which He spoke to them." (Luke 2:49-50)</font><br>
When you first read Jesus' reply to His mother, you almost want to speak to Him about talking back to His mother. But before you jump to a conclusion, look further.</p>
<p>
Children can be perverse, deceitful, and manipulative. But I don't think that is what we see here. I believe we see a somewhat naive, twelve-year-old, who is so engrossed in discussing and learning the Scriptures that He hasn't realised the caravan had left without Him. He has found a place to sleep, perhaps, with friends who hadn't gone home so early. Perhaps He didn't believe that His parents would have gone home without Him -- that they must still be in Jerusalem. Maybe, when He discovered they had already left, He decided to stay put where they could find Him. And, surely, they should know where to find Him -- in the Temple, in His Father's house.</p>
<p>
"Did you not know that I must be about My Father’s business?" is more than a boy's somewhat naive question. This is a turning point in Jesus' life. Mary speaks about "your father and I" in Luke 2:48. But in Luke 2:49, Jesus takes the word "father" and applies it to the God of the Temple.</p>
<p>
The personal intimacy of the phrase "My Father" referring to God is unprecedented in Jewish literature, where it might be expressed as "in heaven" or "our Father." It is this amazing claim of intimate filial relationship to the Father that gets Him accused of blasphemy later in life (John 10:29-39).</p>
<p>
The tension Jesus is facing is whether He should obey His heavenly Father or His earthly father. This passage gives us a glimpse that at age twelve Jesus is feeling a necessity, a compulsion, to do the Father's will.  We see this a number of times in Luke to indicate Jesus' inner compulsion to seek out His destiny <br>(Luke 4:43; 9:22; 13:33; 17:25; 19:5; 22:37; 24:7; 24:26; 24:44; 24:46). Jesus must be about His Father's business. He must be learning so that He might teach. He must!</p>
<p>
In His child's confidence that this ought to be crystal clear, Jesus explains His reasoning, but to no avail. "But they did not understand the statement which He spoke to them" (Luke 2:50).</p>
