Proclaiming the Nazareth Manifesto
</h1>
<p>
Jesus was anointed with Holy Spirit at His baptism in the Jordan. We understand now that He was both a king and a priest. In the synagogue in those days, there was a set reading for each Sabbath from the first five books of the Bible; but the second reading could be chosen from the prophetic books by the person invited to read. Jesus chose His passage from Isaiah, and the subject of the passage is an individual with a mission unlike that of any priest or king.</p>
<p> 
Before we move on to think about the mission of Jesus, let’s just remember that Jesus promised His disciples, including us, that they would also be anointed by the Holy Spirit. We pray for the anointing of the Spirit at baptism, at confirmation, and at many other times in our worship.</p>
<h3>
The mission of Jesus
</h3>
<p>
As we reflect on the ministry of Jesus we can read more meaning into the Isaiah passage: </p>
<p>
Good news to the poor – what good news? That God is indeed King over all the earth; that He loves them, and they can come to Him for relief from their burdens, and to be forgiven </p>
To proclaim freedom for the prisoners and to release the oppressed – we didn’t see Jesus and disciples storming the jails and freeing criminals; but in the area of physical freedom we think of the healing of the paralysed; and of the healing and rehabilitation of outcasts with a dreaded skin disease. In the area of spiritual freedom we think of those who were in unwholesome relationships, such as Zaccheus the tax collector, or the woman caught in adultery… Jesus gave each of them freedom to make a new start. Perhaps as 21st century westerners we make a distinction between physical and spiritual oppression and freedom. I am not sure that Jesus would have made that distinction. </p>
Recovery of sight for the blind – physical sight yes, eg John 9. Also spiritual blindness, as we read at the end of that chapter, where some Pharisees ask, ‘Surely we are not blind, are we?</p> 
To proclaim the year of the Lord’s favour – the reference here is to the year of Jubilee, when people were set free from their debts. This is what the hearers of Isaiah and those who listened to Jesus would have understood. But we understand him to be referring not to a year, but to the new age of the New Testament, in which people are released from their debt to God, because Jesus paid the price on the cross. So using the words prophesied by Isaiah several hundred years before, Jesus declared His anointing by God, and His mission on earth. Challenging stuff for His hearers then, and for us today.</p>
<h3>
Our anointing and mission
</h3>
<p>
If we see Jesus as our Lord and Saviour, and we call ourselves His disciples, if we are now His body on earth then the anointing and the mission of the church should be the same as His. At the end of Matthew’s gospel we find Him telling His disciples to make more disciples, disciples from all nations, teaching them to obey everything that He had commanded.</p>
<p>
We are to take good news to the poor;</p>
<p>
We are to proclaim freedom to the oppressed;</p>
<p>
We are to bring sight to the blind;</p>
<p>
We are to proclaim the Lord’s favour.</p>
<p>
That is the challenge for us! We can think of it as a collective challenge for us as the body of Christ of which we are each members. Together we can do these things even if they are too much for us as individuals.</p>
