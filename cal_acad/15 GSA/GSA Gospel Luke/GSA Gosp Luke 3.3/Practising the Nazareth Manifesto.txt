<h1>
Practising the Nazareth Manifesto
</h1>
<p>
How Christian are we? Perhaps, these are the days we should ponder this question. </p>
<p>
To answer this question, perhaps, Christianity has to be defined. But we know what it is. Any doubt? Just check the Nazareth Manifesto of Jesus (Luke 4:18-19). The points to be kept in mind are:</p>
<p>
Proclaim good news to the poor</p>
<p>
Proclaim freedom for prisoners</p>
<p>
Recovery of sight for the blind</p>
<p>
Set the oppressed free</p>
<p>
Proclaim the year of the Lord’s favour</p>
<p>
These are the salient characteristics of the Nazareth Manifesto or in other words the Vision statement made by Jesus before He started His public service. Or this was the basis with which Jesus was to live as a human on earth. Obviously, this is the life style and mission expected of one who calls himself Christian.</p>
<h3>
Proclaim Good News to the Poor
</h3>
<p>
Who is poor? The one who doesn’t have means for two square meals a day is poor, no doubt. The one who doesn’t have the bare minimum clothes to cover his body is poor. The one who doesn’t have a shelter to protect him is a poor. Are we caring for such people? Maybe, many among us are tithing promptly. If not tithing, we may be giving something from our earnings as charity. But can we say that we are acting responsibly? The manifesto says, the good news must be proclaimed to them. Or we must make them receptive to good news. By our magnanimity in charity or tithe or alms giving, we can never make them receptive to good news. The simple truth is that we must make them as much as we are. This is what we need to understand by the spirit of Nazareth manifesto.</p>
<h3>
Proclaim Freedom for Prisoners
</h3>
<p>
And who is a prisoner, who is oppressed? A prisoner need not be behind bars always. The one who is around us day in and day out can be a prisoner. He has been imprisoned by lots of issues from which he has no liberation. Can we proclaim good news to him without setting him free from these burdens? Without such liberation, will he be receptive to good news? The oppressed or the marginalised are exploited by people with no mercy or no compassion. We are just not bothered to assist. Do we have any initiative towards such of our brethren beyond our routine charity activities?</p>
<h3>
Recovery of Sight for the Blind
</h3>
<p>
The blind can’t be limited to those who lost their power of vision in the physical sense, but it must be understood as those who are spiritually and morally blind. If so, how many among us can claim not to be blind? Jesus said, <font color= "blue">“Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you would have no sin; but now you say, "We see." Therefore your sin remains.” (John 9:41)</font>. Can we assimilate any good news proclaimed to us? Had we been truly receptive to the good news, this world would have been already transformed to the true Kingdom of God. A change is absolutely necessary in our lives. Maybe we are aware of the need, but we are not prepared to give up the comforts we enjoy to fulfil our body and mind meaning, we are not too concerned about the Kingdom of God.</p>
<h3
Set the Oppressed Free
</h3>
<p>
If these are the scenarios we create for ourselves, what impact can be there by the proclamation of good news! The mood that rules us seems to be nothing short of business, making money and living the good life. I would be glad if I am proved wrong, but this seems to be the norm. The ones that are enslaved, or oppressed, by alcohol, smoking, drugs etc need to be helped to overcome these evils but there are so few people willing to assist them to rehabilitate themselves. 
The reason is simple: we are not ready to live for others. And we follow Christ; sorry we claim to follow Christ who shed His blood for others including you and me.</p>
<h3>
Proclaim the year of the Lord’s favour
</h3>
<p>
The core message of the manifesto makes one understand that the Christian service has to be centred on four groups or segments of people. They are the poor, the prisoners, the blind and the oppressed. It is only after these four groups are taken care of, will the year of the Lord’s favour be proclaimed. Perhaps, once these segments are properly taken care of, proclamation of the year of Lord’s favour will be just a normal development.</p>
<h3>
How Christian are we
</h3>
<p>
The incidents briefed above may not involve all Christians, but many Christians are also not far behind. Basically we can say the society or the community is at fault. But Christ has taught us, the chosen ones, calling us friends, that we are the salt of earth. What is so peculiar about salt? Just recall the umpteen sermons we have heard over the years. As salt gives good taste to food, we, the chosen ones must spread goodness among our fellow brethren so our style of living tastes good. The purpose of our being chosen is just that. As the salt preserves food from getting rotten, we are to preserve the community from going rotten. But what we do in reality? We run away from the Nazareth Manifesto which we brand as too theoretical to put into practice. </p>
<p>
We hear so many sermons, we read the Bible morning and evening yet, the transformation is far away. We are not prepared to follow Jesus in His true spirit. We are almost like the rich youth who approached Jesus seeking eternity. We do need eternity, the Kingdom of God, but are not ready to choose the right route. In short, proclamation of good news to the poor, blind, prisoners, oppressed remains a reality too distant to accomplish so long we, the ones entrusted with this task, don't follow the manifesto. How Christian are we?</p>
