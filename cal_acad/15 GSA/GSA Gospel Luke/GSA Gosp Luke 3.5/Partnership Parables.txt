The Setting 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Then all the tax collectors and the sinners drew near to Him to hear Him. And the Pharisees and scribes complained, saying, “This Man receives sinners and eats with them.” (Luke 15:1-2)</font></p>
<p>
Even after our Lord’s strong words about the cost of discipleship (if Luke 15 follows chronologically after the end of Luke 14), and the exhortation for those who had ears to hear, there are many coming to Jesus to hear what He was teaching (Luke 15:1). It was a different matter with the Pharisees and scribes. They were grumbling. Specifically, they were grumbling about the fact that Jesus “received sinners and ate with them” (Luke 15:2). Why should this be such an offence to the Pharisees and the scribes? What did it matter to them if Jesus chose to associate with sinners?</p>
<p>
From early in the book of Luke, the Pharisees chafed over Jesus’ association with sinners, and the mood of joy and celebration which dominated the scene of His eating together with them (Luke 5:29ff.). The Pharisees found no joy in repentance of sinners at all. What did give them joy? And what was it that caused them such pain to have Jesus associating with sinners and enjoying them? I believe that the fullest explanation of this is to be found in Matt 23. In this chapter, Jesus stripped away all of the façade of self-righteousness and spirituality which surrounded the Pharisees. He sternly rebuked them, thus precipitating His own execution. What was it in Matt 23 which characterised the Pharisees and scribes, and which helps us to understand their agony at seeing sinners flock to Jesus? Let me summarise several pertinent characteristics of the Pharisees, as our Lord exposed them:</p>
<p>
(1) The Pharisees loved the place of honour at banquets (Matt 23:5). They loved attention. They found banquets to be occasions where they could attract attention to themselves, where they could be in the limelight. No wonder the Pharisees were distressed about the “banquets” Jesus attended. He was in the place of honour, not them. And in addition to this, the tables were not occupied by people of prominence, people who would enhance the image of the Pharisees (especially if the Pharisee sat in a position of higher honour, cf. Luke 14:7-11). Jesus was, in the minds of the Pharisees, upstaging them.</p>
<p>
(2) The Pharisees loved to restrict the “saved” to a select few, the elite of Judaism (Matt 23:13). The Jews, as a group, felt superior to the Gentiles, but the Pharisees felt superior to other Jews (John 7:45-49). They wanted to keep the “saved” to a very small number, and to keep the undesirable element out. Jesus, by association with the masses, the common people, threatened to pollute this pure group of pious people.</p>
<p>
(3) The Pharisees loved to focus on the technicalities (Matt 23:16-24). The Pharisees set themselves up as the elite, based (to some degree) upon their expertise in very complex rules and regulations. Jesus condemned this in Matthew’s account. We know from the recorded teaching of Jesus, along with the fact that His teaching attracted the common people, that His teaching was simple (e.g. parables), and was not complex and complicated, so as to leave the masses in a fog. When Jesus taught simply, He threatened to undermine the complicated, technical teaching of the Pharisees, and thus they opposed people pursuing Him to hear His teaching.<br>
Now you see why the masses went to Jesus. He could make the truth simple; the Pharisees made it mind-bogglingly complex.</p>
<p>
(4) The Pharisees sought to protect and promote their own hypocrisy by concentrating on external “sins,” rather than inner attitudes and motivations (Matt 23:13-14, 25-36). The Pharisees looked at sin as an external thing, rather than a matter of the heart. In the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus emphasised the internal aspects of sin (cf. Matt 5-7). To associate with those whose outward lives were sinful was to challenge the entire system of spirituality which the Pharisees had developed, and that was to avoid outward, socially unacceptable, sin, and those who did such evils. Therefore they could not passively accept the opposing view of spirituality of our Lord, which enabled Him to have contact with sinners, and yet not be defiled by it.</p>
<p>
Jesus knew why the Pharisees and scribes were grumbling. The three parables which He spoke in response, were directed toward the Pharisees and scribes (cf. Luke 15:2-3). The first two parables reveal that the Pharisees, in some cases, had great compassion on certain “lost” items, and they also greatly rejoiced when they found them. The third parable, the parable of the prodigal son, reveals the attitudes of the Pharisees which caused them to resent the salvation of sinners, rather than to rejoice in it.</p>
<h3>
The Lost Sheep 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
So He spoke this parable to them, saying:<br>
“What man of you, having a hundred sheep, if he loses one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and go after the one which is lost until he finds it?  And when he has found it, he lays it on his shoulders, rejoicing. And when he comes home, he calls together his friends and neighbours, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost! I say to you that likewise there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance. (Luke 15:3-7)</font></p>
<p>
Jesus began by directing His critics attention to their own attitudes and actions as it related to a lost sheep. Which one of them, if they owned 100 sheep, would not leave the 99 to search for but one lost sheep? After a diligent search, would they not rejoice greatly at finding the one lost sheep? Would they not tenderly put the sheep on their shoulders, lovingly carrying it back to the fold, rather than “kicking it back,” scolding it all the way? And would they not then let their friends know of their success and have them over to celebrate the finding of the one lost sheep?</p>
<p>
The assumption is that every one of the Pharisees would have responded to the loss and finding of one sheep just as Jesus suggested. In a similar way, Jesus added, all of heaven rejoices over the repentance of one lost sinner. Heaven, too, rejoices more at the repentance of one lost sinner, more than over the 99 “righteous” who seemingly did not need to repent.</p>
<p>
When you think about it, the parable of the lost sheep presents us with some haunting questions. Would it be wise, even profitable, for a man to put 99 sheep at risk, leaving them unprotected in an open field, to search for one lost lamb? That one lamb may well have been killed, or it might never be found. And would finding this one sheep be such an occasion of joy that one would want to celebrate with all his friends. Stop and think about the expense of having a celebration banquet, to celebrate the finding of one sheep. The celebration will undoubtedly be a banquet feast, with lots of meat served. Let’s say, then, that five sheep and perhaps a couple of goats are slaughtered, not to mention the cost of the other food. One might have to sell off or kill five sheep to celebrate the finding of one. That is not good economics. It is a very sentimental story, but once the reality of it sets in it just doesn’t seem to square with real life. Let’s put this question in hold, momentarily.</p>
<h3>
The Lost Coin
</h3>
<p> <font color= "blue">
“Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp, sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds it? And when she has found it, she calls her friends and neighbours together, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the piece which I lost! Likewise, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents.” (Luke 15:8-10)</font></p>
<p>
Just as the shepherd would be touched by the loss of but one sheep, the loss of part of the family finances would deeply touch the woman of the house. It would seem that the loss of that one coin was equal to one day’s wages. The woman would “turn the house upside-down” to find that one lost coin. She would light a lamp to illuminate her search, and then she would sweep and clean until she found it. We get the impression that she would not stop until the lost coin were found.</p>
<p>
When the coin is found, she, like the shepherd, would rejoice greatly at finding it. She, too, would call her friends and neighbours, so that they could rejoice with her. Once again, it is assumed by our Lord that all of His audience would be nodding their heads in agreement. They would search for the lost coin, just as they would rejoice in finding it.</p>
<p>
Once again, heaven’s joy at the repentance of one sinner is like this (note, “Likewise,” Luke 15:10, for the second time). The angels, as Peter and Paul both inform us (1 Peter 1:12; 1 Cor 11:10), are most interested in what is going on here on earth. They know that it is the plan and purpose of God to save men, on the basis of the shed blood of the Son of God. It is as though the angels were leaning over the rail of heaven, straining to see just one saint come to repentance and faith. Great effort is expended in reaching the lost and when the sinner repents, the angels rejoice in seeing God’s purposes fulfilled.</p>
<p>
Heaven’s joy at the salvation is surely appropriate, and, in one sense, it is like the joy of the woman who found her one lost coin. But is the woman’s effort justified? Would she not have found the lost coin eventually? Should she be so happy at finding this coin? Is it such a momentous thing that she should be bothering to call all of her friends to share this with them? Once again, the search and the rejoicing seems to be overdone, when it comes to the sheep and the silver (coin).</p>
<h3>
Observations Concerning the First Two Parables
</h3>
<p>
It is my contention that the first two parables are a pair, emphasising the same truth. The second parable begins with the expression, “Or suppose,” indicating that the second parable is like the first. The third parable is to be seen as distinct, focusing attention on a different area. Note with me the following characteristics of the first two parables, which is a key to our understanding what Jesus meant to be understood by them, as well as the basis upon which the third parable can be interpreted.</p>
<p>
(1) In both parables, sinfulness is not stressed (in going astray, getting lost), but lostness.</p>
<p>
(2) In both parables, the owner takes the initiative, seeking the lost.</p>
<p>
(3) In both cases, the owner seeks diligently and persistently.</p>
<p>
(4) In both cases, the owner rejoices and invites and expects his neighbours to do likewise.</p>
<p>
(5) In both cases, the rejoicing of the one who has found the lost item is likened to the rejoicing of heaven to the salvation of one sinner.</p>
<p>
(6) In both cases, it is not men who are lost, but things, and it is man (generically speaking, for there is both a man and a woman) that seeks diligently to find what is lost.</p>
<p>
(7) In both cases, I believe, the parable is not primarily intended as a picture of God’s seeking after lost men, but of men seeking after lost things.</p>
<p>
This last observation is the most crucial one for us. Earlier, it was my understanding that the first two parables described God’s heart for the lost. This cannot be the case, for several reasons. </p>
<p>
First, Jesus begins the first parable with the words, “Which one of you, if ...” Jesus was not describing God’s response to that which is lost, but their own. The Pharisees could easily agree that if they lost one sheep or one coin, they would diligently seek to find it, and they would greatly rejoice in finding it. </p>
<p>
Second, the over-zealous attitude of the Pharisees toward finding that which was lost or the extreme joy at finding it is explained. Should one abandon the 99 sheep, leaving them vulnerable to getting lost or to attack by wild animals? Is it not abnormal to notify all of one’s neighbours as to the finding of but one sheep, and to expect them to celebrate this with him? This over-zealousness is not characteristic of God, but it is believable in men.</p>
<p> 
Third, the joyful response of heaven is likened to that of heaven, but in a way that suggests similarities and contrasts to the actions and attitudes of the Pharisees in seeking that which was lost.</p>
<p> 
Fourth, the first two parables speak of men’s zeal in searching for and finding lost possessions, not lost people. The Pharisees were “lovers of money” (Luke 16:14), and it is therefore not hard to see how they would leave 99 sheep to seek one lost sheep, or to turn the house upside-down to find one lost coin. A materialist would easily identify with the mental torment of losing even one out of 100 sheep or one out of 10 coins. A materialist can’t stand to lose anything, and he (or she) would rejoice in finding what was lost.</p>
<p>
The Pharisees were like Jesus in that they did have compassion, as can be seen in the tenderness of the shepherd toward the lost sheep, which he placed over his shoulders. The Pharisees cared very much for that which was lost, and they rejoiced greatly concerning the recovery of what was lost. The critical difference between Jesus and the Pharisees is that they cared about possessions, while Jesus cared about people. The Pharisees were hypocrites. They grumbled that Jesus could gladly receive back repentant sinners and rejoice in their salvation, yet they would diligently search for lost possessions and celebrate when they found them. The first two parables, then, expose the misplaced compassion of the Pharisees. They also contrast the “love for that which was lost” in the Pharisees with that of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>
The Pharisees were “out of sync” with heaven. Why were they unwilling to seek to save sinners and unable to rejoice at their repentance? Why were they unwilling to associate with them? This is what the third parable will tell us. The third parable depicts the loving and forgiving heart of God (in the father), the repentance of the sinner (in the younger brother), and the sullen joylessness of the Pharisees (in the older brother).</p>
<h3>
The Tale of Two Sons<br> 
(Better Known as The Parable of the Lost Son)
</h3>
<p> <font color= "blue">
Then He said: “A certain man had two sons. And the younger of them said to his father, "Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me". So he divided to them his livelihood. And not many days after, the younger son gathered all together, journeyed to a far country, and there wasted his possessions with prodigal living. But when he had spent all, there arose a severe famine in that land, and he began to be in want. Then he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he would gladly have filled his stomach with the pods that the swine ate, and no one gave him anything.<br>
“But when he came to himself, he said, How many of my father’s hired servants have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you, and I am no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants.”
“And he arose and came to his father. But when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. And the son said to him, ‘Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.<br>
“But the father said to his servants, Bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet. And bring the fatted calf here and kill it, and let us eat and be merry; for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found. And they began to be merry.<br>
“Now his older son was in the field. And as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing. So he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant. And he said to him, Your brother has come, and because he has received him safe and sound, your father has killed the fatted calf.<br>
“But he was angry and would not go in. Therefore his father came out and pleaded with him. So he answered and said to his father, Lo, these many years I have been serving you; I never transgressed your commandment at any time; and yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might make merry with my friends. But as soon as this son of yours came, who has devoured your livelihood with harlots, you killed the fatted calf for him.
“And he said to him, Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours. It was right that we should make merry and be glad, for your brother was dead and is alive again, and was lost and is found.” (Luke 15:11-32)</font></p>
<p>
I am now convinced of one thing: the parable of the prodigal son is not recorded in Scripture primarily as instruction to parents of wayward children. I understand this parable in its context as Jesus response to the grumbling of the Pharisees and scribes because of Jesus’ acceptance of and rejoicing with repentant sinners. If the first two parables reveal to us that the Pharisees did care (too) much about “lost possessions,” this parable exposes why they are not concerned about lost people. In Luke 15, this parable serves as the Lord’s final, forceful response to the grumbling of the Pharisees at His response to sinners.</p>
<p>
There are really three persons in focus in this parable, not just one: the younger brother, the father, and the older brother. In order to understand and interpret this parable accurately, I will focus our attention briefly on each of these three characters. I will also forewarn you that I will not be as sentimental in my interpretation of this parable as some have tended (wrongly, in my opinion) to be. For us, this story may seem to be a very heart-warming incident, only slightly tarnished by the sulking older brother. For the Pharisees, this was a humiliating exposure of their sin and their hypocrisy. It did not produce “warm, fuzzy feelings,” at least not for those Pharisees who understood what Jesus was saying to them. Let us concentrate, then, on each of the three central characters of this parable.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
The Younger Brother</font></p>
<p>
Let me emphasise two aspects of this story which relate to the younger brother. <br>
First, there is no attempt to minimise the seriousness or the foolishness of the sins of the younger son. Jesus did receive sinners and eat with them, but He never minimised sin. The seriousness of the young brother’s sins can only be understood in the light of his identity (I am assuming) as an Israelite. As an Israelite, this young man would understand several things about the blessings which God promised His chosen people. God was going to bless His people in the land. The young man left the land and went to a distant one. God was going to bless His people for obeying His law. This included the necessity of living a life that was very distinct (holy) from that of the heathen. This young man went and lived among the heathen as a heathen. </p>
<p>
The Old Testament had very specific legislating to assure that the inheritance of each family was kept within the family, and that the children cared for their parents. This young man deserted his family, permanently lost his portion of the inheritance, and left his father in a potentially precarious position (he had just lost 1/3 of his father’s resources, and had lost his ability to look after him). For an Israelite, nothing could be lower than to be the slave of a heathen, and to have as one’s job the care of swine. This younger son, I say, acted in a very wicked and foolish way. I can envision Jesus’ audience sucking in their breath in shock and horror at what this man had done. I can see the Pharisees becoming bug-eyed and red-faced with anger at this man’s sin. Jesus did not attempt to minimise this younger son’s sin.</p>
<p>
If the younger son’s sins were great, so was his repentance.<br> 
Second, let us look at the characteristics of the younger brother’s repentance. The younger brother’s repentance was required by his sin, he very great sin, as we have just emphasised. The process of repentance began, I believe, when the younger brother began to suffer the painful consequences of his sin. It was only when he ran out of money and friends, and when he began to suffer hunger pangs that the young man “came to his senses.” Repentance begins, then, with seeing things straight, with seeing things as they really are. Repentance begins by seeing one’s actions as sinful, first in the sight of God, and then in the sight of men. Thus, the words of the son to his father, <font color= "blue">“Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you,” (Luke 15:18)</font>. The son’s repentance then led him to his father, whom he had offended, and to whom he acknowledged his guilt and sorrow. The son’s repentant spirit is reflected in his deep sense of unworthiness. He does not speak of or claim any rights. He hopes only for mercy. There are no demands. The son’s repentance touched the heart of his loving father, and paved the way for his restoration and rejoicing.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
The Father</font></p>
<p>
While the shepherd and the housewife accurately depicted the concern of the Pharisees for their possessions, it is the loving father of this parable who depicts the heart of the loving Heavenly Father, who longs for the return of the sinner, who willingly grants forgiveness, and who rejoices in the return of the wayward. This father gave the son what he had asked for. He allowed the son to go his own way, even when he could have prevented it (at least he could have refused to finance the venture). The heart of that father never forgot the wayward son. It was no accident that the father saw the son coming<font color= "blue"> “when he was still a great way off” (Luke 15:20)</font>. The father ran to meet the son. He did not force the son to grovel. He did not even allow the son to finish his confession. The father quickly restored the son to his position as a son. The father commanded that there be a celebration. And when the older brother refused to participate, the father sought him out and appealed to him to join in the celebration, which he saw not only as permissible, but as necessary. The father was as gracious to the older brother as he was to the younger. How great the love of this father. How much like the Heavenly Father he is.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
The Older Brother</font></p>
<p>
The older brother we know to be the one in the parable who represents the Pharisees and scribes, who grumble at Jesus’ reception of sinners. Notice that the older brother is out in the fields working when the younger brother returns. The father, on the other hand, is apparently waiting and watching for the younger son’s return. He does not know of the younger brother’s return until his attention is aroused by the sounds of celebration coming from the house. He learns from a servant that his brother has returned, that the father has received him, and that a celebration has been called. The mention of the killing of the fatted calf is the “final straw” for the older brother. He became very angry and refused to go in to celebrate with the rest, even though this celebration was called for by the father.</p>
<p>
When the father came out to his older son, to appeal to him to join in on the celebration, the older son refused. The words of the older son are the key to understanding his desires and attitudes. Give attention to those things which this son mentioned to his father, which are the basis of his actions, his anger, and his protest:</p>
<p>
(1) I have worked hard, but you gave me no banquet. This emphasis on works is the error of the Pharisees as well. The were “hard at work” with respect to keeping the law, as they interpreted it, supposing that this was what would win God’s approval and blessing.</p>
<p>
(2) You have given your other son a banquet, when all he did was to sin. This is, of course, the flip side of the first protest. The older brother expected to be rewarded on the basis of his works, and he would likewise have expected his younger brother to have been disowned due to his works (sins). It was not the younger brother’s sins which resulted in the father’s celebration, but in his repentance and return. The older brother not only failed to comprehend grace, but he resented it. There are many similarities between the prophet Jonah in the Old Testament and this older brother.</p>
<p>
(3) I have never neglected a command of yours. Not only does this son think that his works should have merited his father’s blessings, he also is so arrogant as to assume that he has never sinned. The Pharisees, too, thought of themselves as having perfectly kept God’s commandments.</p>
<p>
The problem of the older brother, then, is self-righteousness. What the older brother did not think he needed (repentance and salvation) he resisted and resented in others, and thus he could not, he would not share in the celebration.</p>
<p>
The father’s words to this son are significant. He reminded this older brother of the blessings which he had in staying home. He had, during those years when the younger son only had the fellowship of pagans and pigs, the fellowship of his father. The father said, “My child, you have always been with me ...” (Luke 15:32a). This, for the older brother, was not enough, for he would have preferred to have been with his friends (Luke 15:29). The father’s second statement was to remind the older son that he possessed all that was his: “... and all that is mine is yours” (Luke 15:31b). This, too, did not seem enough to this older son.</p>
<h3>
Conclusions
</h3>
<p>
The message which these three parables brought home to the Pharisees and scribes is painfully clear: they had too much compassion for their own lost possessions, but they cared little for lost people. This is why they could not rejoice at the repentance of lost sinners. But there is even more than this. It isn’t that the Pharisees and scribes found it impossible to rejoice; they actively resisted—they grumbled. The bottom line was that the Pharisees wrongly believed that it was good works which merited God’s favor, rather than His grace manifested toward sinners.</p> 
<p>
The older brother was angry with the father because he felt he did not get what he deserved (a banquet), while the younger brother got what he didn’t deserve (a banquet). The older brother’s works didn’t work, but the younger brother’s repentance did. That is the way God’s grace works—it is bestowed on unworthy people, sinners, who do not trust in their good works, but in God’s grace.</p>
<p>
This explains the Pharisees’ rejection of Jesus. He came to bring salvation to sinners, by grace, through faith, and not of works.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, even the righteousness of God, through faith in Jesus Christ, to all and on all[a] who believe. For there is no difference; for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, (Rom 3:21-24)</font>.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not of works, that no one should boast (Eph 2:8-9)</font>.</p>
<p>
The problem of the Pharisees was that they were too good for their own good. They viewed others as “sinners,” but not themselves. They believed that they, by keeping the law, could earn God’s favor, and that unworthy sinners would be condemned to hell. They failed to see themselves as unworthy sinners (like the prodigal did), and thus they not only rejected God’s grace, they disdained it.</p>
<p>
Finally, our text forces us to ask if we, as a church, welcome sinners, or whether we, like the Pharisees, send them a clear message that they are not wanted. If we understand the grace of God, we will welcome sinners as those, like us, who are unworthy of God’s favor, and rejoice when they experience grace as we have. We will not seek the salvation of those whom we will not also welcome into our fellowship. Let us seek to have the mind of Christ in warmly receiving sinners, like us.</p>
