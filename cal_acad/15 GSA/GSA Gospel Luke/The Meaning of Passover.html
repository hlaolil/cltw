The Meaning of Passover
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Then He said to them, “With fervent desire I have desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer; for I say to you, I will no longer eat of it until it is fulfilled in the kingdom of God.” (Luke 22:15-16)</font></p>
<p>
The Lord longed to share the passover meal with His disciples. He was less than 24 hours away from fulfilling this part of His mission and He must have had mixed feelings of relief and excitement.</p>
<p>
The Passover meal commemorated the Jews deliverance from slavery in Egypt (Ex 13:3-10). It also had a much deeper spiritual application that, as Jesus explains here, would be fulfilled through His death.<br> The Jewish nation as a whole had missed any future prophetic meaning of the Passover.</p>
<p>
On the night of the original Passover, the Lord passed through the land of Egypt and judged the land by slaying all the first born men and beasts. <br>The Jews had to slay a spotless lamb, take its blood and apply it to the door posts of their homes. They were commanded to remain indoors, under the covering of this blood until morning. When the Lord passed through the land at midnight to execute His judgement, He passed over the homes that had the lamb’s blood on their doors and no one inside was hurt. <br>This is a perfect picture of the redemption that Jesus provides for us.</p>
<p>
Everyone deserves judgement because of their sins. However, Jesus provided Himself as a spotless, sacrificial lamb for us, so that if we apply His blood to our lives by confessing Him as Lord, God will pass over us on Judgement day.</p>
</p>
<p>
Jesus was sacrificed, on the cross, on the 14th day of the first month of the Jewish year – the exact day and time that the Passover lambs were being slain. <br>Truly,<font color= "blue"> “Christ our Passover was sacrificed for us” (1 Cor 5:7)</font>.</p>
<p>
[<i>Abib/Nisan, the first month of the Jewish year, falls somewhere within our months of March and April. It changes in relation to our months because the Jews use a lunar calendar (months of 29 or 30 days), with an extra month inserted in the year periodically to maintain the seasons.<br> The name of the month was changed from Abib to Nisan - Which means: their flight - after the Babylonian Captivity (Neh 2:1)</i>]</p>
