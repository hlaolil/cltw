<h1>
The Virgin Mary
</h1>
<p>
Mary the mother of Jesus was described by God as <font color= "blue">“highly favoured” (Luke 1:28)</font>. The phrase “highly favoured” comes from a single Greek word, which essentially means “much grace.” Mary received God’s grace.</p>
<p>
Grace is “unmerited favour,” meaning something we receive despite the fact that we do not deserve it. Mary needed grace from God just as the rest of us do. Mary herself understood this fact, as she declared <font color= "blue">“And my spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour.” (Luke 1:47)</font></p>
<p>
Mary recognised that she needed the Saviour. The Bible never says that Mary was anyone but an ordinary human whom God chose to use in an extraordinary way. Yes, Mary was a righteous woman and favoured (graced) by God (Luke 1:27-28). At the same time, Mary was a sinful human being who needed Jesus Christ as her Saviour, just like everyone else (Eccl 7:20; Rom 3:23; 6:23; 1 John 1:8).</p>
<p>
Mary did not have an “immaculate conception.” The Bible doesn’t suggest Mary’s birth was anything but a normal human birth. Mary was a virgin when she gave birth to Jesus (Luke 1:34-38), but the idea of the perpetual virginity of Mary is unbiblical. Matt 1 speaking of Joseph, declares, he <font color= "blue">did not know her till she had brought forth her first born Son. And he called His name Jesus.” (Matt 1:25)</font><br>
The word “until” clearly indicates that Joseph and Mary did have sexual union after Jesus was born. Joseph and Mary had several children together after Jesus was born. Jesus had four half-brothers: James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas (Matt 13:55). Jesus also had half-sisters, although they are not named or numbered (Matt 13:55-56). God blessed and graced Mary by giving her several children, which in that culture was the clearest indication of God’s blessing on a woman.</p>
<p>
One time when Jesus was speaking, a woman in the crowd proclaimed, <font color= "blue">“Blessed is the womb that bore You and the breasts which nursed You!” (Luke 11:27)</font>. There was never a better opportunity for Jesus to declare that Mary was indeed worthy of praise and adoration. What was Jesus’ response?  <font color= "blue">“But He said, “More than that, blessed are those who hear the word of God and keep it!” (Luke 11:28)</font>. To Jesus, obedience to God’s Word was more important than being the woman who gave birth to the Saviour.</p>
<p>
Nowhere in Scripture does Jesus, or anyone else, direct any praise, glory, or adoration towards Mary. Elizabeth, Mary’s relative, praised Mary in Luke 1:42-44, but her praise is based on the blessing of giving birth to the Messiah. It was not based on any inherent glory in Mary.</p>
<p>
Mary was present at the cross when Jesus died (John 19:25). Mary was also with the apostles on the day of Pentecost (Acts 1:14). However, Mary is never mentioned again after Acts chapter 1. The apostles did not give Mary a prominent role. Mary’s death is not recorded in the Bible. Nothing is said about Mary ascending to heaven or having an exalted role there. As the earthly mother of Jesus, Mary should be respected, but she is not worthy of our worship or adoration.</p>
<p>
The Bible nowhere indicates that Mary can hear our prayers or that she can mediate for us with God. Jesus is our only advocate and mediator in heaven (1 Tim 2:5). If offered worship, adoration, or prayers, Mary would say the same as the angels: “Worship God!” (see Rev 19:10; 22:9.) Mary herself sets the example for us, directing her worship, adoration, and praise to God alone: <font color= "blue">
“My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Saviour. For He has regarded the lowly state of His maidservant; for behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed. For He who is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is His name.” (Luke 1:46-49)</font>.</p>
