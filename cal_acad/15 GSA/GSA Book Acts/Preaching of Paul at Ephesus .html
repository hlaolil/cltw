   <h1>
Preaching of Paul at Ephesus 
</h1>
<p>
Paul’s third missionary journey was, in large part, devoted to preaching in Ephesus and the surrounding cities. He had stopped briefly at Ephesus earlier, and found a positive response to the gospel (Acts 18:19-21). However, as Paul had been intent on going to Jerusalem and Antioch, he couldn’t stay very long, but promised to return. Luke says little about what happened during Paul’s two-year ministry at Ephesus and Asia. He focused on a few incidents that happened, especially a riot, and devoted most of his report to the circumstances surrounding it.</p>
<h3>
Disciples of John the Baptist
</h3>
<p>
Luke began his narrative of events at Ephesus by relating a curious story.<br> Paul met some “disciples” (that is what Luke calls them) who had been followers of John the Baptist. The group included 12 men (Acts 19:7). <br>It isn’t clear under what circumstances Paul encountered these people. <br>Nor did Luke state if or how they were associated with the Christian community in Ephesus.</p>
<p>
These disciples were defective in their knowledge of the Way, and didn’t even know about one defining characteristic of Christians (Eph 1:13). <br>When Paul asked whether they had received the Holy Spirit, they replied, <br>“No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit” (Acts 19:2). <br>The group was ignorant of the Pentecost event and everything that followed.</p>
<p>
The fact that these people—who were almost certainly Jews—were disciples of John the Baptist and his teachings, and had not heard of the Holy Spirit, is puzzling. John had clearly spoken of the Messiah as one who would baptise with the Holy Spirit (Matt 3:11; Mark 1:8; Luke 3:16).</p>
<h3>
John’s Baptism 
</h3>
<p>
Paul then went on to ask which baptism they had received. They replied they had received <font color= "blue">“John’s baptism” (Acts 19:3)</font>, which was a baptism of repentance. Paul told the group that they needed to be baptised <font color= "blue">“in the name of the Lord Jesus” (Acts 19:5)</font>. Then they would receive the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>
Whether these “disciples” were resident of Ephesus or had come from somewhere else (perhaps with Apollos from Alexandria) is not known. <br>How they could be regarded as disciples—apparently knowing about Jesus—but did not understand baptism nor even hear about the Holy Spirit is all rather odd.</p>
<p>
Some commentators feel that when Luke called them “disciples,” he must have meant they were disciples of John. This might help explain their ignorance of New Testament baptism, and even the Holy Spirit. But Luke called them “disciples” with no qualification whatsoever. One would think that if he meant they were disciples of John, he would have said so explicitly. <br>Possibly what Luke meant by “disciples” was that they were followers of Christ in the same way that people followed Jesus during His ministry. They were not disciples in the fullest sense of the word, since the sign of the disciple is one who has received the gift of the Holy Spirit <br>(John 3:5; Rom 8:9; 1 Cor 12:3; Titus 3:5; Heb 6:4; 1 Peter 1:2; <br>1 John 3:24; 4:13).</p>
<p>
Some suggest that these disciples may have once been part of an extensive and influential sect of followers of John the Baptist. They point to evidence that such a sect may have existed in the second century. Josephus mentioned John as being influential (Antiquities of the Jews 18:116-119). <br>The New Testament verifies that he was highly regarded by the Jewish people (Matt 14:5; 21:46; Mark 11:32; Luke 20:6). This may be the reason Luke included this account in his narrative. It could have had something to do with the John-the- Baptist sect competing with the Christian movement for people’s allegiance.</p>
<p>
We may see something of this struggle for influence in the Gospel of John, perhaps written in the A.D. 90s. John was careful to portray the Baptist’s ministry as being inferior to Jesus and His ministry <br>(John 1:19-23; 29-43; 3:22-36). <br>The Gospels also go out of their way to make it plain that John the Baptist was only the forerunner of Jesus. They have the Baptist admit that his position is so inferior to Jesus’ that he isn’t even worthy to carry his sandals (Matt 3:11). </p>
<p>
Perhaps this sect grew to some degree on a parallel track to the Christian mission, and may in some cases have been its rival. Luke, writing perhaps between the mid-A.D. 60s to the 80s, would have included this vignette to make a point: the true body of Christ is the church, not the sect of John the Baptist’s followers. Luke would have been trying to show that such disciples of John needed to become Christians. They could do this by being re-baptised into Jesus by a duly authorised missionary of Christ’s body, the church universal—and receiving the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h3>
Baptised into Jesus’ Name 
</h3>
<p>
When Paul explained to these former disciples of John the Baptist that they should be baptised into Jesus’ name, they readily agreed. By doing so they were putting their faith in Jesus and repenting. The reason these individuals were baptised, and apparently Apollos was not, is unclear from Luke’s account. Perhaps they still thought of John’s baptism as being fully sufficient.</p>
<p>
Now, this group of John’s disciples was seeing the light. By accepting another baptism, these people were saying that they understood the superiority of Jesus to John. They were willing to come under the authority of a representative (Paul) of the one body that was correctly defined. (At least some of the apostles had been followers of John and must have been baptised by him [John 1:35-37]. There is no evidence they were re-baptised into Jesus’ name. But they had readily become the followers of Jesus.)</p>
<p>
After the former disciples of John were baptised, <font color= "blue">“Paul placed his hands on them” and they received the Holy Spirit (Acts 19:6)</font>. <br>There is an association, but not a consistent one, between baptism and the laying on of hands in the book of Acts. Peter and John did lay hands on the Samaritan converts (Acts 8:17). This was done in Samaria to make it clear that the despised Samaritans had been accepted into the fellowship by the leaders of the Jewish Christians in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>
In Ephesus, too, the laying on of hands denoted acceptance. Paul, as a representative of the church, accepted these former members of a John-the-Baptist sect. Upon this demonstration of faith, the disciples received the Holy Spirit (Acts 19:6). <br>As an outward evidence of this,<font color= "blue"> “They spoke in tongues and prophesied” <br>(Acts 19:6)</font>. <br>As the Jews on Pentecost, and as the household of Cornelius, these people received the same gift. There was no question about it, because the coming of the Spirit had been verified by the same outward signs (Acts 11:17).</p>
<h3>
Paul Spoke Boldly in Synagogue 
</h3>
<p>
After Luke finished the story of the Baptist disciples, he dramatically switched the scene. Paul was now preaching in the synagogue. For three months Paul debated with the Jews <font color= "blue">“reasoning and persuading concerning the things of the kingdom of God” (Acts 19:8)</font>.<br> Luke here emphasised the “kingdom of God” aspect of Paul’s message. However, we shouldn’t think Paul preached a substantially different message in Ephesus from his usual one. His gospel message was concerned with both Jesus and the kingdom (Acts 28:31), because one cannot separate the king from the kingdom. The message of Jesus is the message of salvation.<br> But personal salvation is not obtained apart from God’s kingdom.</p>
<p>
The fact that Paul continued in the synagogue for three months shows that the Ephesian synagogue elders were more tolerant than those in Thessalonica <br>(or perhaps that Paul was becoming more careful in the way that he presented the gospel).<br> But even here, Paul eventually outlasted his welcome. Some of the Jews began to publicly deride “the Way” (Acts 19:9). Paul then left the synagogue, took the disciples with him and began daily discussions in the lecture hall of Tyrannus (Acts 19:9). This is thought by some to be the auditorium of a local philosopher with the name Tyrannus. Others see Tyrannus as the owner of the building, who rented space to speakers such as Paul. (Tyrannus means “Tyrant,” and it was probably a nickname reflecting the man’s personality.) We know nothing else of Tyrannus. But he was introduced so casually that it’s possible Luke’s readers (especially Theophilus) would have known who he was.</p>
<h3>
All in Asia Heard 
</h3>
<p>
Paul’s work in Ephesus continued for two years, <font color= "blue">“so that all the Jews and Greeks who lived in the province of Asia heard the word of the Lord” (Acts 19:10)</font>.<br> Most likely we are to add Paul’s three months of speaking in the synagogue to the total time (Acts 19:8), along with other events. The full time that he was in Ephesus might have been nearly three years (Acts 20:31). This may correspond to the years between A.D. 52-53 and 55.</p>
<p>
Paul did not confine his ministry to the city of Ephesus. Luke says that Jews and Greeks throughout the entire province of Asia heard the word (Acts 19:10). People in a number of important cities in Asia would have heard the gospel during these years. We are familiar with some of these cities from other New Testament writings: Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, Laodicea, Colossae, Miletus, Hierapolis, and Magnesia. It’s possible the seven churches mentioned in the book of Rev, chapter 2 and 3, were begun during Paul’s stay in Ephesus.</p>
<p>
Paul did not necessarily go to every city himself, though he almost certainly evangelised in some of them. Paul’s associates, travelling converts, and word-of-mouth tales about such things as the miracles of healing would have spread the gospel message from city to city in the province of Asia. While Paul taught at the lecture hall of Tyrannus, his colleagues carried out missionary work in other cities. Epaphras appears to have been one of Paul’s associates who worked in Colossae, Laodicea, and Hierapolis (Col 1:7-8; 2:1; 4:12-13). These were cities of the Lycus valley, which Paul apparently did not personally visit.</p>
<h3>
Striking Miracles 
</h3>
<p>
During Paul’s stay in Ephesus, the power of God was demonstrated mightily, giving the gospel an attentive hearing.<br> Luke wrote: <font color= "blue">“God did extraordinary miracles through Paul, so that even handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched him were taken to the sick, and their illnesses were cured and the evil spirits left them” (Acts 19:12)</font>. <br>Luke’s emphasis was on God doing the miracles through Paul.<br> Luke was highlighting the divine power at work.</p>
<p>
Paul was able to “heal at a distance,” as it were. Cloth that Paul had touched could heal the sick. We are reminded of similar “at a distance” healings in the woman whose bleeding disease was healed when she touched Jesus’ cloak <br>(Mark 5:27-34). Paul’s healing work was also equated with Peter’s, whose passing shadow could cause people to be healed (Acts 5:15). As was the Master, and Peter, the “chief of the apostles,” Paul also was given an extraordinary power of God. Paul himself referred to the signs that had accompanied his preaching of the gospel. These proved that God was using him as he was the other apostles—as such signs marked an apostle (Rom 15:18-19; 2 Cor 12:12).</p>
<h3>
Seven Sons of Sceva 
</h3>
<p>
The story above explained that God did extraordinary miracles through Paul in healing people and casting out demons, even at a distance. In his next scene, Luke gives a sharp and humorous contrast: the powerlessness of Jews who tried to usurp Paul’s name and the authority of Jesus to effect exorcisms.<br> Apparently, Paul’s name and power had become so widespread in Asia that others were hoping to cash in on the exorcism bandwagon. This was becoming a major problem, as a number of Jews were trying to mimic the mighty demonstrations of God’s power that were being accomplished through Paul.</p>
<p>
Luke cited the example of the seven sons of Sceva, who tried to perform exorcisms. According to Luke, They <font color= "blue">“took it upon themselves to call the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, "We exorcise you by the Jesus whom Paul preaches.” (Acts 19:13)</font>.<br> We don’t know who Sceva was. Luke called him a <font color= "blue">“Jewish chief priest” <br>(Acts 19:14)</font>. <br>It’s possible he did belong to a Jewish chief-priestly family. Perhaps either Sceva or his seven sons (or both) may have been renegade priests from a high priestly family. Some commentators speculate Sceva may have been an apostate Jew and the high or chief priest of some pagan cult. However, it is known that no individual named Sceva was ever the high priest in Jerusalem since the names of all the Jewish high priests in Jerusalem have been identified.</p>
<p>
Another possibility is that the title “Jewish chief priest” was Sceva’s own self-designation, and Luke simply reported what he said about himself.<br> If Luke would have been writing today he may have placed the title between quotation marks. On the other hand, Luke does not say Sceva was the one who was a professional exorcist. It was his seven sons whom Luke singled out as trying to use Paul’s name. It’s possible they even “believed” Paul’s message in the same way that Simon of Samaria had (Acts 8:9-24).</p>
<p>
But in a somewhat comic sequel to this serious story, Sceva’s sons were unable to use God’s healing and exorcism power as a commodity to dupe innocent people. The finale occurred one day when they were attempting to exorcise an evil spirit. <br>It said to them, <font color= "blue">"Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?" Then the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, overpowered them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.” (Acts 19:15-16)</font>.</p>
<h3>
All became Fearful 
</h3>
<p>
Sceva’s seven sons were apparently so well-known for their magic and sorcery that the news of their drubbing quickly spread. It was now clear that Paul has a greater power than any of the sorcerers. One is reminded of the story of Moses and the magicians of Egypt during the Exodus. For a time, the magicians of Pharaoh seemed to match some of the plagues Moses was bringing on Egypt. But soon it was clear that a greater power was with Moses. Even the magicians finally told Pharaoh, <font color= "blue">“This is the finger of God” (Ex 8:19)</font>.</p>
<p>
The same thing happened in Ephesus when Sceva’s sons failed in their exorcism attempt.<br> <font color= "blue">This became known both to all Jews and Greeks dwelling in Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified” (Acts 19:17)</font>. Many even renounced their magic arts and burned their books or scrolls of magic incantations. Paul must have convinced them that these books were not just worthless—they were worse than worthless and ought to be destroyed rather than sold. Numerous people burned their magic books.</p>
<p>
Luke tells us that the value of these scrolls was 50,000 thousand drachmas (Acts 19:20). It’s hard to determine the modern value of the drachma, anchored as it was in an ancient agrarian economy. The drachma was a silver coin worth about a day’s wages. Enough money to pay 50,000 workers for a day went up in smoke. </p>
<p>
This was the third confrontation between a preacher of the gospel and a practitioner of magic in Luke’s narrative. God’s servants encountered Simon Magus (Acts 8:4-25) in Samaria, Bar Jesus/Elymas in Cyprus (Acts 13:4-12) and now the seven sons of Sceva. In each case, the message of God and its messenger triumphed over the forces of darkness and evil. This is how Luke ended this section of his narrative, on a positive and upbeat mode.<br> He summarised the growth of the church and gospel by saying:<br><font color= "blue"> “So the word of the Lord grew mightily and prevailed.” (Acts 19:20)</font>.</p>
<h3>
After All This ... 
</h3>
<p>
This summary of the progress of the gospel introduced what is probably the last panel or major division of Acts.<br> (The six panels are:<br> 
a) Acts 1:1 -   &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Acts 6:7, <br>
b) Acts 6:8 -   &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Acts 9:31, <br>
c) Acts 9:32 -  &#160;&#160;&#160Acts 12:24, <br>
d) Acts 12:25 - &#160;Acts 16:5, <br>
e) Acts 16:6 -  &#160;&#160;&#160;Acts 19:20, <br>
f) Acts 19:21  - &#160;&#160;Acts 28:31.) </p>
<p>
The last panel begins with the statement:<br> <font color= "blue">"When these things were accomplished, Paul purposed in the Spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, "After I have been there, I must also see Rome.” (Acts 19:21)</font>. <br>This marks the final part of Luke’s story of the movement of the gospel from Jerusalem to Rome. It encompassed the years between A.D. 55-6 and 61-2.</p>
<h3>
The Cult of Artemis 
</h3>
<p>
About the time that Paul was preparing for his trip, <font color= "blue">“there arose a great commotion about the Way” (Acts 19:23)</font>. <br>A man named Demetrius, probably the leader of a regional guild of silversmiths, called together not only his guild but also those in related trades. <br>(Acts 19:25-26). The silversmiths made a tremendous profit from selling silver shrines of the goddess Artemis. 
The silversmiths of Ephesus regarded their guild as being under the special patronage of Artemis, in whose honour so many of their wares were manufactured. Among these wares were miniature silver niches, containing an image of the goddess, which her votaries bought to dedicate in the temple. The sale of these was a source of considerable profit to the silversmiths. </p>
<p>
Artemis of Ephesus (Latin, Diana) was the mother-goddess of fertility. <br>She was depicted as a grotesque, multi breasted woman. Her image at Ephesus was believed to have been constructed in heaven and to have fallen from the sky—from the gods (Acts 19:35). The temple of Artemis was one of the Seven Wonders of the ancient world, and it supposedly could hold up to 50,000 people. </p>
<p>
Ephesus had declined since its heyday as a centre of shipping, due in large part to the continual silting up of its harbour. The economy of the city had become increasingly dependent on the tourist trade associated with the cult of Artemis. Now, because of Paul’s preaching, people were turning away from the Artemis cult. The business of these miniature silver shrines must have fallen off, and the silversmiths were worried about their source of income. Paul was threatening the economy of Ephesus.</p>
<p>
In his speech, Demetrius got to the nub of his complaint about Paul’s preaching, noting that Paul was preaching <font color= "blue">
“that they are not gods which are made with hands.” (Acts 19:26)</font>. <br>In a skilful piece of oratory, Demetrius united the workmen’s economic concerns with their superstitious fears. <font color= "blue">“So not only is this trade of ours in danger of falling into disrepute, but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis (Diana) may be despised and her magnificence destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worship” (Acts 19:27)</font>.</p>
<h3>
City in an Uproar
</h3>
<p>
Demetrius enlisted the silversmiths and craftsmen from some other trades to begin a riot. They hoped to turn the Ephesians against Paul, and at the same time, create an even greater devotion to Artemis. Naturally, this would translate into greater profits for the tradesmen. Paul had disturbed vested business interests, and now the “better business bureau” of Ephesus swung into action against him. On the pretext of religious devotion, they began a tactic sure to stir up the superstitious devotion of the populace.</p>
<p>
The tradesmen apparently were assembled in an open-air theatre, the usual place for public meetings (Acts 19:29). Perhaps they were in the theatre on the eastern side of the city whose ruins are known. This theatre could hold about 25,000 people, and it was in full view of the temple of Artemis. <br>The tradesmen in the theatre began shouting,<br> <font color= "blue">“Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” (Acts 19:28)</font>. <br>This attracted other people, and before long the entire city was in an uproar.<br> A crowd joined the noisy riotous fight, many without even understanding what it was about. Luke wrote:<font color= "blue"> “Some therefore cried one thing and some another, for the assembly was confused, and most of them did not know why they had come together” (Acts 19:32)</font>.</p>
<p>
While rushing to the theatre, some of the crowd grabbed Gaius and Aristarchus, two men working with Paul (Acts 19:29). They were then dragged into the theatre with the crowd. 
Paul was concerned about the fate of these two men at the hands of a frenzied mob. He wanted to go before the crowd, but was forcibly restrained by some of the converts (Acts 19:30). <br>Luke said,<font color= "blue"> “Then some of the officials of Asia, who were his friends, sent to him pleading that he would not venture into the theatre” (Acts 19:31)</font>. <br>Luke took this opportunity to again point out that Rome and its officials were not antagonistic to Paul and the gospel message.</p>
<p>
Meanwhile, the Jews sent their own representative, Alexander, to the theatre in order <font color= "blue">“to make his defence before the people” (Acts 19:33)</font>.<br> Since Luke didn’t tell us, we don’t know exactly what point Alexander wanted to make or who he was. Presumably he wanted to disassociate the Jews from the Christians as the cause of this uproar. The Jews had something to worry about. Jews, like Christians, were monotheistic and posed a threat to the paganism of the times. <br> It’s no surprise, then, that when the idolatrous mob realised Alexander was a Jew, <font color= "blue">all with one voice cried out for about two hours, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” (Acts 19:34)</font>.</p>
<p>
During the commotion, Paul had been restrained from heading for the theatre to confront the crowd, presumably to try to reason with it. But there was no need for his presence, as city officials cooled down the mob and ended the riot.<br>  Once again, Paul had to sit on the sidelines to see events worked out in his and the gospel’s favour, and experience the salvation of the Lord.</p>
<h3>
Officials Stop the Riot 
</h3>
<p>
The city clerk quieted the crowd by reassuring it that the worship of Artemis wasn’t being threatened (Acts 19:35). He chastised the mob for unjustly condemning Gaius and Aristarchus. <font color= "blue">“you have brought these men here who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of your goddess” (Acts 19:37)</font><br>  The officials of the province of Asia, the Asiarchs, had already expressed their friendliness toward Paul (Acts 19:31). Now the city clerk intervened on behalf of Paul’s associates. Vested business interests may not have liked Paul’s preaching, but the government was still a friend of the gospel.</p>
<p>
The “city clerk” (an unfortunate translation) was the main executive officer of the town assembly, and the city’s chief magistrate. He was the most important local official of Ephesus, and would be held responsible for any riots within the city. The city clerk served as the liaison between the town council and the provincial Roman administration with its headquarters in Ephesus.</p>
<p>
Realising the potential penalties the city might receive from Rome, the city clerk implored the mob to take their grievances to the proper authority. <br> He said Demetrius and the guilds could press charges in the courts and with the proconsuls (Acts 19:38).<br>  <font color= "blue">“It shall be determined in the lawful assembly. For we are in danger of being called in question for today's uproar, there being no reason which we may give to account for this disorderly gathering” (Acts 19:39-40)</font>. <br> If the city was cited for rioting, the clerk pointed out, it was in trouble with Rome. There was no way the local officials could account for the disturbance. The chief magistrate urged the crowd to disband and go home, which apparently it did.</p>
<h3>
Unmentioned Troubles
</h3>
<p>
From Luke’s story of Paul’s two-year stay in Ephesus, one might assume that this was the only major problem he encountered. But that is not the case.<br>  Even here Paul did not directly suffer in the riot, as he remained on the sidelines waiting for events to work out favourably. Luke did refer in passing to some difficulty Paul had with the Jews at the beginning of his stay, but this was glossed over rather quickly in a phrase, with no details given (Acts 19:9). Otherwise, Luke made it appear as though Paul had an easy time of it in Ephesus, with success piled on success.</p>
<p>
But when we turn to Paul’s letters, we realise that the successes at Ephesus came at the cost of great suffering. <br> Paul wrote in one letter that <font color= "blue">"I have fought with beasts at Ephesus,” <br> (1 Cor 15:32)</font>. Even if this is a metaphor for violent persecutors, it reveals something of the trials Paul endured during the two years at Ephesus.<br>  In the same letter, Paul spoke <font color= "blue">“about our trouble which came to us in Asia: that we were burdened beyond measure, above strength, so that we despaired even of life.” (2 Cor 1:8)</font>.<br>  Priscilla and Aquila, who were resident in Ephesus at this time <font color= "blue">"risked their own necks for my life,” (Rom 16:3-4)</font> said Paul.</p>
<p>
Later Paul told the Ephesian elders that he had been <font color= "blue">“serving the Lord with all humility, with many tears and trials which happened to me by the plotting of the Jews; (Acts 20:19)</font>.<br>  Paul later met with the elders of Ephesus in Miletus rather than in the city <br> (Acts 20:17). Perhaps he did this because he felt it too dangerous for him to return to Ephesus.</p>
<p>
During his time at Ephesus, Paul also had great concern about the troubled state of the Corinthian church. His first letter makes this worry abundantly clear. Some visitors from Corinth told him about the deep and bitter divisions within the church (1 Cor 1:11-12) and about blatant sexual immorality being tolerated in the congregation (1 Cor 5:1). However, if Paul faced such dangers and problems in Ephesus as his epistles indicate, then Luke chose to ignore them. <br> He had already given us examples of the kind of persecution that Paul experienced. Perhaps he did not feel it necessary to belabour the point.</p>
