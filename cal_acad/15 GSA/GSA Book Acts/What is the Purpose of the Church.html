What is the Purpose of the Church
</h1>
<p>
This could be considered a purpose statement for the church:</p>
<p> <font color= "blue">
“They continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine and fellowship, in the breaking of bread, and in prayers.” (Acts 2:42)</font></p>
<p>
According to this verse, the purposes/activities of the church should be: <br>
1) teaching biblical doctrine,<br> 
2) providing a place of fellowship for believers, <br>
3) observing the Lord’s supper, and <br>
4) praying.</p>
<p>
The church is to teach biblical doctrine so we can be grounded in our faith.<br> <font color= "blue">“that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting,” (Eph 4:14)</font></p>
<p> 
The church is to be a place of fellowship, where Christians can be devoted to one another.<br>
honour one another (Rom 12:10),<br> 
instruct one another (Rom 15:14), <br>
be kind and compassionate to one another (Eph 4:32),<br> 
encourage one another (1 Thess 5:11), and<br>
most importantly, love one another (1 John 3:11).</p>
<p>
The church is to be a place where believers can observe the Lord’s Supper, remembering Christ’s death and shed blood on our behalf (1 Cor 11:23-26).<br> The concept of “breaking bread” (Acts 2:42) also carries the idea of having meals together. This is another example of the church promoting fellowship.<br>The final purpose of the church according to Acts 2:42 is prayer. <br>The church is to be a place that promotes prayer, teaches prayer, and practices prayer.<br> This encourages us to: <font color= "blue">
“Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.” (Phil 4:6-7)</font></p>
<p>
Another commission given to the church is proclaiming the gospel of salvation through Jesus Christ (Matt 28:18-20; Acts 1:8). <br>The church is called to be faithful in sharing the gospel through word and deed. The church is to be a “lighthouse” in the community, pointing people toward our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. <br>The church is to both promote the gospel and prepare its members to proclaim the gospel (1 Peter 3:15).</p>
<p>
Some final purposes of the church are:<font color= "blue">
“Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.” (James 1:27)</font></p>
<p>
The church is to be about the business of ministering to those in need. <br>This includes not only sharing the gospel, but also providing for physical needs (food, clothing, shelter) as necessary and appropriate.<br>The church is also to equip believers in Christ with the tools (like Bibles if they can't afford one) which they need to overcome sin and remain free from the pollution of the world.<br>This is done by means of biblical teaching and Christian fellowship.</p>
<p>
So, what is the purpose of the church? Paul gave an excellent illustration to the believers in Corinth. The church is God’s hands, mouth, and feet in this world—the body of Christ (1 Cor 12:12-27). <br>We are to be doing the things that Jesus Christ would do if He were here physically on the earth. <br>The church is to be “Christian,” “Christ-like,” and Christ-following.</p>
