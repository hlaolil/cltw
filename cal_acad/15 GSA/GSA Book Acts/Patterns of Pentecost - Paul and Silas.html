Patterns of Pentecost <br>Paul and Silas
</h1>
<h3>
The Devil-possessed Girl
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Now it happened, as we went to prayer, that a certain slave girl possessed with a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much profit by fortune-telling.  This girl followed Paul and us, and cried out, saying, "These men are the servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation."<br> And this she did for many days." (Acts 16:16-18a)</font></p>
<p>
This girl was obviously possessed with a devil spirit that through her, seemed to advertise Paul and his mission there. At a first glance, it may appear that what we have here is the paradox of the devil supporting the work of the Lord!! However, would it ever be possible that something like this could happen?<br> I do not think so. </p>
<p>
What the devil is continuously seeking (he never ceases from this) is:<br> to pervert the right ways of the Lord. Hence, the only reason he seemed to proclaim the same things as Paul, was exactly because he wanted to pervert the right ways of the Lord. It is not really difficult to understand how he planned to do this. Just imagine how much the Word that Paul was preaching was degraded by its outward agreement with the proclamations of this devil-possessed girl.<br> To the locals she was but a spokesperson of the ancient Greek god Apollo.<br> We know this for the ancient text does not say that the girl was possessed with a spirit of divination, but that she had "a spirit. </p>
<p>
Obviously, this girl was considered by the locals as one through whom Apollo spoke. That's why the text says that she had a spirit. Moreover, her "most high God", and the one that those locals perceived as such, was not the one true God, the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, but ... Zeus. It is now easy to understand what perversion she brought to Paul's preaching and that what the adversary wanted to do through her, was not to proclaim but to "pervert the right ways of the Lord." Fortunately, he did not succeed in his purposes.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"But Paul, greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her." And he came out that very hour." (Acts 16:18b)</font></p>
<p>
Paul knew through the operation of discerning of spirits (1 Cor 12:7-10) that what spoke through this girl was a devil spirit. That's why he addressed it so directly, casting it out "that very hour".</p>
<h3>
Thrown Into Prison
</h3>
<p>
Unfortunately, the deliverance given to this girl did not make everyone happy. Her masters earned a lot of money from the deceitful works of the devil spirit:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"But when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace to the authorities.<br> And they brought them to the magistrates, and said, "These men, being Jews, exceedingly trouble our city; and they teach customs which are not lawful for us, being Romans, to receive or observe." Then the multitude rose up together against them; and the magistrates tore off their clothes and commanded them to be beaten with rods. And when they had laid many stripes on them, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to keep them securely. <br>Having received such a charge, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks." (Acts 16:19-24)</font></p>
<p>
After such tribulation, many of us would have started complaining to God, blaming Him for what had happened. Yet, murmuring is not what the Word tells us to do on similar occasions. </p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"If anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this matter". (1 Peter 4:16)</font></p>
<p>
That's exactly what Paul and Silas did!</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"But at midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them." (Acts 16:25)</font></p>
<p>
Apart from the fact that those two badly tortured men were praying and singing to God, see also that all the prisoners were listening to them. <br>The word "listening" in this passage, does not simply mean to "listen", but "to listen paying particular attention to what is said". </p>
<h3>
A Great Earthquake
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's chains were loosed". (Acts 16:26)</font></p>
<p>
To understand the importance of the above event let's for a minute put ourselves in the position of one of those prisoners. So, let's suppose that you are in prison listening with particular attention to two badly tortured guys that glorify God and suddenly an earthquake happens that ... loosens your chains and opens all the doors of the prison. Wouldn't you be reminded of this phenomenon all your life? Would this not be enough to make you call upon Paul's and Silas' God? I think so. In fact, let us see the immediate reaction of one of the men that was there that night.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"And the keeper of the prison, awaking from sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, supposing the prisoners had fled, drew his sword and was about to kill himself. But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do yourself no harm, for we are all here. Then he called for a light, ran in, and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas. And he brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" (Acts 16:27-30) </font> </p>
<p>
How was this man sure that Paul and Silas were able to give him the right answer to such a critical question? The answer is because he heard them praising God and saw how God replied through the earthquake and what followed. He was therefore persuaded these two truly represented God.<br> That's why he asked them so straightforwardly. </p>
<h3>
Paul's and Silas' reply
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household." (Acts 16:31)</font></p>
<p>
Really, I do not know how many people today would be so straightforward about salvation as Paul and Silas were. "believe on the lord Jesus Christ and you will be saved." That's really it. You believe you are saved. You do not believe you do not get saved. 
<p><font color= "blue">
"That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved." (Rom 10:9)</font></p>
<h3>
The Late Night Prison Fellowship
</h3>
<p>
How simple it is! Returning to the record of the prison keeper, after Paul and Silas gave him the answer he needed, they continued teaching him further:
<p><font color= "blue">
"And they spoke the Word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house. And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes; and immediately he and all his family were baptised. And when he had brought them into his house, he set food before them; and he rejoiced, having believed in God with all his household". (Acts 16:32-33)</font></p>
<p>
Note the time that all this happened. It happened after midnight, for it was already midnight when Paul and Silas were praying and singing to God <br>(Acts 16:25). After midnight therefore, Paul, Silas, the prison keeper and his household had a wonderful fellowship in which many souls were saved and rejoiced in the Lord!! Who could really imagine that this could happen?<br> And yet here it is in the Scripture. However, would this have occurred if Paul and Silas instead of glorifying God they were murmuring to Him? No. They glorified God in their troubles, teaching, through their praises and prayers, the Word to the other prisoners. </p>
<p>
God backed His Word with a great sign that certainly had tremendous impact on all. In fact, the prison keeper with all his family, believed that very night and had a great fellowship with Paul and Silas well after midnight!!<br> Really what a blessing it is to read such events. And what a blessing and healing this would have been for Paul and Silas, after the torture they suffered. However, the blessings did not stop there. </p>
<h3>
The Next Day
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"And when it was day, the magistrates sent the officers, saying, "Let those men go." So the keeper of the prison reported these words to Paul, saying, <br>"The magistrates have sent to let you go. Now therefore depart, and go in peace." But Paul said to them, "They have beaten us openly, un-condemned Romans, and have thrown us into prison. And now do they put us out secretly? No indeed! Let them come themselves and get us out." And the officers told these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans. Then they came and pleaded with them and brought them out, and asked them to depart from the city. So they went out of the prison and entered the house of Lydia; and when they had seen the brethren, they encouraged them and departed.". (Acts 16:35-40)</font></p>
<p>
At the end of the day, it was the magistrates that were humiliated and not Paul and Silas. In fact, they pleaded with Paul and Silas to depart from their city. However, they had already managed to set up a church there. This church would have never been created, as many other churches in Greece, if Paul and his company had not obeyed God's will to go to Macedonia, but acted according to their own wishes. Nevertheless, the fact that they obeyed God's will, it did not mean that they did not suffer persecution. Yet, God even turned persecution to good and through it many souls were saved, increasing the church in that place and giving great deliverance and encouragement to His people.</p>
