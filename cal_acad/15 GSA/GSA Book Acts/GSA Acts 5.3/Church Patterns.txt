<h3>
Pattern of Preaching and Teaching
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
So they called them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of Jesus. (Acts 4:18)</font></p>
<p>
When Israel’s Sanhedrin Court realised that they couldn’t intimidate Peter and John into ceasing their preaching about Jesus’ resurrection, they used the full authority of their position of judges on the court to give the apostles a “cease and desist order.” (Acts 4:18).</p> 
<p>
In order to fully appreciate why the Jewish religious leaders reacted to this miraculous healing of the crippled beggar by forbidding the apostles to speak or to teach “in the name of Jesus,” we need to understand what it meant in first-century Palestine to do something “in the name of” someone.<br>
Doing anything “in someone’s name” implied three significant facts:<br>

You were doing exactly what that person wanted done.<br>
You were doing it by that person’s authority.<br>
You were doing it exactly as that person wanted it done.</p>
<p>
The Jewish religious leaders certainly didn’t want the Jewish people to believe that Jesus was really responsible for the miraculous healing of the crippled beggar.  After all, that would imply that He really was resurrected from death.  It would also imply that He had supernatural power.  It would also imply that he had undeniable spiritual authority.  They didn’t want to take any chances that the actions of the apostles would lead more people to believe these things about Jesus.</p>

Pattern of Church Discipline

But Peter said, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back part of the price of the land for yourself? 4 While it remained, was it not your own? And after it was sold, was it not in your own control? Why have you conceived this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God.” (Acts 5:3-4)</font></p>
<p>
The first thing to note is that Luke is writing a descriptive and selective history of the beginnings of the church. In fact, the word "church" is first used here at Acts 5:11. It is descriptive of what happened not necessarily prescriptive for the church at all times. The early experiment in social communism on the part of the early Jerusalem church did not carry forward. Still, the care of the early Christians for each other certainly serves as a fine example of the love that flows from a living faith in Christ.</p>
<p>
The generosity of Barnabas is set in sharp relief against the the duplicity of Ananias and Sapphira. Again, this is an accurate, descriptive account of what happened among the first Christians. The apostles are thereby established in their office. To lie to them is to lie to the Holy Spirit.<font color= "blue"> "You have not lied to men but to God." (Acts 5:3)</font> This is the same Spirit who guarantees the word of the apostles as the authentic Word of God and who works through the office of the holy ministry to deliver the gifts of Christ's sacrificial death to the believer. It is consistent with Jesus' own words concerning those He sent: <font color= "blue">
"He who hears you, hears me" (Luke 10:16)</font>. This obviously has a Law/Gospel polarity to it.</p>
<p>
We should not presume in this episode that Ananias and Sapphira were damned. This is likely no different than those who "fell asleep and even died" in Corinth as a result of their inappropriate eating and drinking of the Lord's Supper (1 Cor 11). This was God's temporal judgement to avert ultimate condemnation with the unbelieving world, a part of God's discipline of His children whom He loves (Heb 12). We are here reminded that a healthy fear of the Lord goes hand in hand with a living faith in Christ. In this sense, the key is: <font color= "blue">"Great fear seized the whole church and all who heard about these events." (Acts 5:11)</font></p>
<p>
One must wonder aloud today, considering what goes on in many of our Christian churches, whether the modern church has the same sense of holy fear as did the first Christians. "Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming fire" (Heb 12:28-29)</font>.</p>
<h3>
Pattern of Church Growth
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Now in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a complaint against the Hebrews by the Hellenists, because their widows were neglected in the daily distribution. (Acts 6:1)</font></p>
<p>
The problem was that the Hellenistic widows of the Jerusalem church were “being neglected in the daily distribution of food”. That is, the church apparently had an organised charity, such as a daily “soup kitchen” for the needy, including widows. But the immigrant widows were not getting an equal share. This was a blight on the church. Both the Torah and the example of Jesus mandated that the community pay special attention to helping widows. [Deut 10:18; 14:29; 16:11, 14; 24:17, 19-21; 26:12-13.] The law even specified a curse for those who neglected the poor (Deut 27:19).</p>
<p>
The prophets stress the responsibility of “doing justice” for widows. [Mal 3:5; Isa 1:17, 23; 10:2; Jer 5:28; 7:6; 23:3; Ezek 22:7; Psa 94:6.] In the New Testament, the epistle of James reflects the importance of such justice, insisting that true religion includes looking after orphans and widows in their distress (James 1:27). Mechanisms for aiding widows had long been promoted in Judaism. Jews had developed a system of aid to the poor and those in need. Religious communities such as the Essenes had a kind of social security system that provided for members needs. But here Christians are neglecting their own.</p>

As in the case of Ananias and Sapphira, this neglect of church widows is no incidental problem. Although Luke presented the situation without condemnation, the affront threatened the spiritual integrity of the Christian community. It’s possible that the inequity in the distribution of food was merely the surface issue. This was maybe part of a larger conflict between two groups who had different cultural backgrounds. (We will eventually see doctrinal differences become more evident between the two groups.)</p>
<p>
Earlier, we saw the Christian community taking care of the needy. Believers were freely sharing their possessions with the less fortunate among them (Acts 2:44-45; 5:32, 34-35). But as the church grew, so did the number of widows who needed help. To make matters worse, widows from the Diaspora would probably be especially in need. They would be less likely to have relatives nearby to help them. And if they did not speak the local language very well, they were maybe missing out on some of the information.</p>
<p>
They were the ones with the most need, but the church was neglecting them. Almost certainly, discrimination was involved in the inequity, but Luke tends to downplay controversies in favour of showing how problems were resolved. The distribution of food was probably in the hands of the Hebrews, and they unthinkingly took care of their own, and the Greek-speaking widows could't communicate their needs to the people doing the distribution.</p>
<p>
Ultimately, the apostles were responsible, because they administered the common fund (Acts 4:34-35), but they had more work than they could handle. Since they were Hebrews, it was easy for them to be unaware that the Greek-speaking widows were being neglected. As soon as they learned that the immigrant widows were being neglected, they immediately took steps to correct the problem.</p>
<p>
When the neglect came to light, the Twelve gathered the church together and told the members that the apostles could no longer manage the food distribution program. They simply lacked the time to do it right. The apostles were too occupied with evangelism to “wait on tables” (Acts 6:2). They ask the group to chose seven men to handle the daily distribution. The apostles turned the responsibility of the “soup kitchen” over to them (Acts 6:3).</p>
<p>
The apostles do not ignore the problem, nor chastise the widows for complaining. Nor did they try to hold on to this important responsibility, because they could do it only if they neglected their duty to preach. Members of the Jerusalem congregation were therefore asked to choose seven people who can take over the social-service work of the church.
<p>
The Twelve obviously had great stature and power in the church community and could have chosen the leaders on their own. But on this critical decision they were willing to give up their authority and ask the community to decide. The apostles turned the authority for working out the solution of the problem to those who felt it most acutely, for they were probably the best ones to solve it.</p>
<p>
The apostles gave requirements: The men were to have both wisdom and the Spirit, or we might say, a wisdom inspired by the Holy Spirit (Acts 6:3). Clearly, the apostles were no longer jockeying for power, as when they were unconverted (Luke 22:24; Matt 20:20-28). The seven men chosen were Stephen, Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicholas, a Gentile convert to Judaism from Antioch (Acts 6:5).</p>
<p> 
These men were able to exercise their gifts from God through the Holy Spirit. Gifts can be anything that glorifies God in the organisation and growth of the church.</p>

Pattern of Martyrdom

"When they heard these things they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed at him with their teeth. But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God, and said, “Look! I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!” Then they cried out with a loud voice, stopped their ears, and ran at him with one accord; and they cast him out of the city and stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their clothes at the feet of a young man named Saul. And they stoned Stephen as he was calling on God and saying, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” Then he knelt down and cried out with a loud voice, “Lord, do not charge them with this sin.” And when he had said this, he fell asleep."</font></p>
<p>
<h3>
Introduction 
</h3>
<p>
In the midst of the rapid growth and development in the church at Jerusalem, there surfaced an occasion of internal strife and discord. In the daily serving of the needy saints, the Hellenistic widows were being overlooked, whereas the Hebrew widows were not. Undoubtedly, charges such as racism, favouritism, and discrimination were beginning to be heard within the church.
This was a serious problem that needed immediate attention lest the church be torn apart. The solution (as stated in Acts 6:3f) was to appoint seven men "of good reputation, full of the Spirit and of wisdom" to oversee the daily ministry of meeting the needs of the needy.
Through their administration, the work would proceed fairly ..... all would have their needs met ..... the tension would subside within the congregation.</p> 
<p>
One of these seven men was named Stephen. Acts 6 tells us Stephen was a man "full of the Spirit of God, full of faith, and full of grace and power."
He was a remarkable man ..... one who performed miracles (Acts 6:8) ... he was very evangelistic ... undoubtedly led many to Christ Jesus. And yet at the end of the next chapter (Acts 7) we see him being stoned to death by a mob of angry Jews! What happened?! What brought about such a remarkable turn of events?!

Considering his wisdom, his faith, his reputation, his works of service, and his miraculous power, why would anyone want to destroy this man?! This is the question we want to try and answer.
Why was Stephen stoned?! The answer may well surprise you!</p>
<p>
<h3>
He Served among the People
</h3>
<p>
The first factor which led to the ultimate death of Stephen is: 
"And Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great signs and wonders among the people." (Acts 6:8) 
Stephen could have stayed home, stayed safe, just quietly attended to his duties of caring for the widows, and thus maintained the good favour of the people.</p>
<p>
But Stephen realised there were people all around him who were lost. People who needed to hear the good news of Jesus Christ. People, perhaps, who had participated in the process that led to the crucifixion of Jesus; who needed to hear that it was their Messiah they had executed.
So Stephen didn't hide within the four walls of some "church building" and play the "saintly sage." Rather, he got out there among a hostile Jewish audience and boldly proclaimed the Truth ... Truth which, at that time and in many circles, was not a popular message.</p>
<p>
Stephen realised that in the battle for men's souls, the soldier of Christ must not be found cowering in a foxhole, afraid to engage the enemy. He must be out among the people, where the battle for souls is being fought.
The first reason Stephen was stoned, therefore, was that he was visible and he was vocal.</p>
<p>
<h3>
Inability to Resist his Spirit
</h3>
<p>
The second factor which ultimately led to his untimely death was that the people who opposed him were unable to successfully cope with and refute his teaching ... nor were they able to abide the spirit with which he spoke.</p>
<p>
Acts 6:7 informs us that the number of disciples was "increasing greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests were even becoming obedient to the faith." The Jews, who were obviously concerned about his success, "rose up and argued with Stephen" (Acts 6:9). Apparently they viewed him as being one of the primary reasons this growth was taking place. Thus, they argued with him publicly.
These debates with Stephen undoubtedly got very heated, and they happened in the public eye. Again, we see his high visibility!
But even worse, at least from the Jews' point of view, Acts 6:10 says "they were unable to cope with (stand up against) the wisdom and the spirit with which he was speaking."</p>

The Jews were determined that they were going to stop this teaching. Stephen was too successful. Thus, they were going to shut him up, and they were going to do it publicly so as to humiliate him and destroy his influence and credibility with the people.
However, just the opposite occurred. It was they who were made to look foolish, because they could not refute the wisdom of his message. Nor could they cope with his godly spirit. Stephen was proclaiming Truth, and they could not stand up against it.

There is an old proverb --- "Stones are not thrown except at the fruit-laden tree." Stephen was stoned, in part, because he was speaking Truth, and this was bearing fruit. This was too much for his opponents to cope with.</p>
<p>
<h3>
False Witnesses and Accusations
</h3>
<p>
Truth which is wisely and boldly proclaimed cannot be met head-on by those engaged in falsehood. The Jews finally realized this, which led to the third factor ultimately resulting in the stoning of Stephen --- they attacked him with lies!</p>
<p>
"Then they secretly persuaded some men to say, 'We have heard Stephen speak words of blasphemy against Moses and against God'" (Acts 6:11). In vs. 13 it says that "they produced false witnesses," who testified (before the Sanhedrin), probably under oath, additional lies.</p>
<p>
Since the Jews couldn't cope with the wisdom and the truthful teachings of this man, they chose to attack the man himself. If you can't refute the message, then worldly wisdom suggests you attack the messenger. This then became their tactic and strategy.
Were these witnesses telling the truth? No ... they perjured themselves before the high council of the Jewish nation: the Sanhedrin. Their accusations were the farthest thing from the truth. But, these men were not interested in God's Truth, they were interested only in stopping Stephen ... and if they couldn't do it honourably, they would do it dishonourably!</p>
<p>
They felt the end justified the means, and in this case the means was: false accusations and lies which were testified to by men who had been bought and paid for. How much lower can one sink than to utilize such methods to destroy another man. Not only were these tactics designed to destroy Stephen's reputation and his effective ministry among the people, but they ultimately led to his violent death!</p>
<p>
<h3>
They Stirred up the People
</h3>
<p>
The enemies of Stephen were not content to simply lie about him and produce false witnesses to bring false accusations before the Sanhedrin. They additionally stirred up public opinion against him to the point that the people, who came to believe the lies, were ready to do away with Stephen.</p>
<p>
"And they stirred up the people, the elders and the scribes, and they came upon him and dragged him away." (Acts 6:12)</p>
<p>

These people worked the crowds. They whipped the people into a frenzy with their lies and false accusations. The people became so worked up that all they wanted was the blood of the righteous Stephen.</p>
<p>
This was much like the situation in Ephesus during the third missionary journey. The critics of Paul whipped up the people of the city to the point of frenzy.</p>
<p>
The people were in total confusion, "some were shouting one thing and some another, and the majority did not even know for what cause they had come together!" (Acts 19:32) Mob psychology is a fascinating study! If you can whip a crowd into a frenzy, you can manipulate them into acting in ways which, under normal circumstances, a rational person would never consider. Through lies, and the public testimony of false witnesses, and some clever manipulation of public opinion, these enemies of Stephen achieved what they were unable to do alone --- the destruction of this godly man.</p>
<p>
<h3>
They were Cut to the Heart
</h3>
<p>
After the false charges had been levelled against him, Stephen was given the opportunity by the High Priest to make a public defence of himself before the supreme council of the Jewish nation: the Sanhedrin. And this Stephen did. However, the "defence" was not really a defence of himself, but rather an impassioned plea for these people to come to their senses and to accept the Truth of Jesus Christ. Some have even called this an attack, not a defence.</p>
<p>
Stephen got very frank with them ... he didn't mince words. He told them they were stiff-necked, that they were uncircumcised in heart and ears, that they were always resisting the Holy Spirit. He accused them of being murderers and betrayers of the righteous, just like their ancestors before them!</p>
<p>
Needless to say, his frankness before the court did not sit well with these leaders, nor with his accusers, and certainly not with the people who had been stirred up against him. "Now when they heard this they were cut to the quick (furious in their hearts), and they gnashed their teeth at him." (Acts 7:54) They were so angered that he had dared to speak this way with them -- never mind how they had spoken about him -- they were filled with such rage, that they began to grind their teeth in their fury.</p>
<p>
<h3>
They Covered their Ears
</h3>
<p>
Furthermore,"they cried out with a loud voice, and covered their ears, and they rushed upon him with one impulse." (Acts 7:57) These people refused to hear another word from this man. They didn't care what he had to say ... they were simply not going to listen.</p>
<p>
They were more than willing to listen to the accusations, but they covered their ears rather than hear his defence and the Truth. How typical this is of human nature. We love the juicy titbit about someone else ... the flaws and failings ... but we're not nearly as quick to listen to reason and the voice of Truth.
It's almost as if we want the lies to be true; we want to revel in scandal. The fact that publications like the National Inquirer sell so well reflects this flaw in far too many of us.</p>
<p>
The people of Jerusalem, having lost all sense of reason, rushed upon Stephen, drove him out of the city gates, then picked up the nearest and the biggest rocks they could handle, and they stoned him to death. And Stephen became the first martyr in the church of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>
<h3>
Some Stood and Watched
</h3>
<p>
All of this was a terrible tragedy, but perhaps the most troubling aspect of this entire episode is: Scripture indicates that there were some who stood by, and watched it happen, and did nothing! We even know the name of one of them -- Saul of Tarsus (later to be known as the apostle Paul).</p>
<p>
All through the wicked process that culminated in Stephen's death, there were observers who knew the truth and who could have intervened. But, the record is silent about any such intervention.</p>
<p>
At the end of Paul's life, as he himself faced execution for his faith, he writes, "No one supported me, all deserted me; may it not be counted against them" (2 Tim 4:16). One has to wonder if perhaps Stephen came to Paul's mind at this moment near the end of his own life!

Paul says, "But the Lord stood with me" (2 Tim 4:17) --- just as Stephen said he saw the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God. And his last words were, "Lord, don't hold this sin against them!" (Acts 7:60). No, I don't think Paul forgot Stephen! He carried the memory with him all his life.</p>
<p>
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
Why was Stephen stoned? Because he was a man of faith, intent upon sharing the good news with others ... because he stood his ground even though the message was not always popular ... because he was bearing fruit for the Lord ... because his opponents decided to stop him, and when they couldn't do it in honest, open debate, they did it with lies and false accusation and manipulation of public opinion ... and he died because some did nothing, but rather stood silently by and watched.</p>
<p>
What a tragedy! What a loss of a good man to the early church! But, what an example of godly determination in the face of ungodly abuse which Stephen has left us!</p>
<p>
There stood that man Saul. You know something? From Stephen came Paul. From Paul came the world. Augustine said, "The church owes Paul to the prayer of Stephen." Stephen was expendable for Paul. Paul was expendable for the world</p>
<h3>
Pattern of Healing
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Peter said, “Silver and gold I do not have, but what I do have I give you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk.”
<p>
As Peter and John went to the temple to pray, they came across a poor man who could not walk. He had been crippled from birth, and was now over forty years old (Acts 4:22). The man apparently made his living by begging at the temple gate (a good place for begging, as it was the “front door” to the temple). He asked Peter and John for some money. The lame man was so accustomed to begging that he did not even bother to look up at the apostles.</p>
<p>
Peter and John did not have any money, but they had something much more valuable to give to the crippled beggar—the healing power of Jesus. Peter said, “In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk” (Acts 3:6). The lame man’s legs instantly became strong enough to support him! He leaped up and walked into the temple with Peter and John. He jumped for joy and praised God. </p>  
<p>
Just as we marvel at the amazing miraculous power given to Peter by Jesus, the people in the temple area on that day were shocked to see the familiar crippled man bounding across the temple court. They all wanted to hear what the apostles had to say. Peter saw that he had the attention of a large group of listeners, so he spoke seriously to the crowd.</p>
<p>
First, he gave God credit for the miracle (Acts 3:12-13). It is not always easy for us to give God thanks and glory for His blessings. Often, we are tempted to take all the credit for the good things we do, and act as if we did it all by ourselves. Many people live as if God does not exist or bless us. Paul called such people fools (Rom 1:21-22).</p>
<p>
Second, Peter taught the crowd about Jesus (Acts 3:14-26). How many times has God given us opportunities to tell people about Christ and the church, only to see us ignore or refuse the offer? We can make ourselves aware of chances to share the Gospel by remembering that each person we meet has an immortal soul. Like Peter and John, we should use every chance we get to help others go to heaven.</p>
<p>
Peter and John could bring the gift of health and a new life in every sense of the word – both physical and spiritual. This miracle was a sign that God was interested in every part of human life.</p>
<p>
Shortly after this Peter and John were arrested (Acts 4:1)</p>
