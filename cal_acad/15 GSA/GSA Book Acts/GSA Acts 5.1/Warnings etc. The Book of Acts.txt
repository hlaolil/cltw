<h3>
The Kingdom of God
</h3>
<p>
What is the overall purpose of the book of Acts? From beginning to end, the book of Acts is concerned with the restoration of the nation of Israel and the establishment of the kingdom of God, their long prophesied earthly hope.
Where do we get our first glimpse of this? God gives us the answer to this question within the first few verses of the book where we read:
<font color= "blue">The former account I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach, until the day in which He was taken up, after He through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom He had chosen, to whom He also presented Himself alive after His suffering by many infallible proofs, being seen by them during forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God. (Acts 1:1-3)</font></p>
<p>
So, based on the above passage, what was the focus of Christ's teaching to His apostles after He rose from the dead? The end of Acts 1:3 is clear, it was “things pertaining to the kingdom of God”.
The following list contains all of the verses in the book of Acts that contain the phrase “the kingdom of God”:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
being seen by them during forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God (Acts 1:3)</font>
</p>
<font color= "blue">But when they believed Philip as he preached the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were baptised.. (Acts 8:12)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and saying, “We must through many tribulations enter the kingdom of God.” (Acts 14:22)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
And he went into the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading concerning the things of the kingdom of God. (Acts 19:8)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“And indeed, now I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, will see my face no more. (Acts 20:25)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
So when they had appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging, to whom he explained and solemnly testified of the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus from both the Law of Moses and the Prophets, from morning till evening. (Acts 28:23)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence, no one forbidding him. (Acts 28:31)</font></p>
<p>
It's interesting to note this term, “the kingdom of God”, is used exactly 7 times within the book of Acts, the number that implies completion or fulfilment.
If we include all of the verses in the book of Acts that use the word “kingdom” throughout, Acts 1:6 must be added to our list, a verse that is not without significance:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Therefore, when they had come together, they asked Him, saying, “Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?" (Acts 1:6)</font></p>
After the 40 days of Christ's teaching, the apostles understood exactly what He was talking about – the restoration of Israel through the establishment of their long awaited, prophesied kingdom and this is exactly what Christ “began both to do and teach (Acts 1:1) in His ministry to Israel as recorded in the Gospel accounts with the following verse as an example:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
but He said to them, “I must preach the kingdom of God to the other cities also, because for this purpose I have been sent.” (Luke 4:43)</font></p>
<p>
So what's going on in the book of Acts based on what we have seen so far? The continuation of Christ's ministry to Israel to bring to fulfilment the establishment of the kingdom of God!
One of the points presented as proof for the Acts 28 position is the perceived distinction in meaning between the usage of the term “the kingdom of God” first in Acts 28:23 and then later in Acts 28:31. In other words, a basis for this view is the belief that a term that is used consistently throughout the book of Acts somehow changes its meaning the last time it's used.</p>
<h3>
Lord Jesus Christ
</h3>
<p>
How can this be justified? It has been suggested that the title “Lord Jesus Christ” used in Acts 28:31 shows that Paul is now referring to a new aspect of Christ implying that the Mystery of Ephesians and Colossians had been revealed to him.</p>
<p>
Is this really supported by the Bible? Let's “search and see” ...
The title “Lord Jesus Christ” in Acts 28:31 is a combination of “Lord”,“Jesus”, and “Christ”.</p>
<p>
This exact title only occurs in the book of Acts in the following 6 verses:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
If therefore God gave them the same gift as He gave us when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could withstand God?” (Acts 11:17)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ we shall be saved in the same manner as they.”. (Acts 15:11)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. (Acts 15:26)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
So they said, “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.” (Acts 16:31)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
testifying to Jews, and also to Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ. (Acts 20:21)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence, no one forbidding him. (Acts 28:31)</font></p>
<p>
The first thing to note is the title “Lord Jesus Christ” is first used by Peter in Acts 11:17 and this is in reference to the preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles by him and their subsequent belief and salvation. This noteworthy event is recounted at the so-called Jerusalem council in Acts 15:11 and later confirmed by James to be something that was in accordance with prophecy – see Acts 15:13-18.
In fact, every occurrence of this title is associated in some way or another with the salvation of God going to the Gentiles. It's also interesting that this title is used 6 times in the book of Acts, a number associated with failure and a required mystery that provides the remedy. What mystery could this be in reference to? One of the mysteries that was central to Paul's ministry throughout the book of Acts is the mystery of the “olive tree” found in Rom 11:25 with its associated “fullness of the Gentiles”. Isn't that interesting?
Therefore, instead of the reference to the title “Lord Jesus Christ” in Acts 28:31 suggesting the beginning of a new ministry, it is actually the culmination of a ministry that started in Acts 10 with Peter and was brought to completion by Paul starting in Acts 13 and continuing until the end of the Acts period.</p>

Another important term found in Acts 28:23-31 is “the salvation of God”. What's most interesting is the fact that other than Acts 28:28, it is only found in one other place in the New Testament. Here's the passage where it is located:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene, while Ananias and Caiaphas were high priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness. And he went into all the region around the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the remission of sins, as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying:, 
The voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight. Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill brought low; and the crooked places shall be made straight, and the rough ways smooth; and all flesh shall see the salvation of God. (Luke 3:1-6)</font></p>
<p>
A few points to note in regards to this passage:
1.The term under discussion is embedded within a quotation from the book of Isaiah the prophet, specifically Isa 40:3-5.
2.The quotation is referring to the baptism ministry of John the Baptist which has as its goal the “remission of sins”.
3.The context of the quotation is twofold, a particular people called “My people” in Isa 40:1 which is obviously Israel and the city of Jerusalem in Isaiah 40:2.
4.Although Israel and their city Jerusalem is the primary focus of this prophecy, it's important to recognise that “all flesh” are also included.
5.Like Acts 28:31, this passage comes from the same human author, Luke.
What “salvation” could possibly be in view here? Undoubtedly, for both Isaiah and John the Baptist it must be the earthly millennial hope which will be realised at the establishment of the kingdom of God.
In addition, there is only one other verse in the books of Matthew-Acts that contains "salvation" and once again it is Luke who uses it. We find the only other occurrence in Luke 2:30 speaking of Christ as <font color= "blue">"a light to  bring revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of Your people Israel (Luke 2:32)</font>. Again, this is associated with Gentiles! This helps confirm that point no. 4 above is most likely referring not to all of Israel alone but also to all Gentiles as well.</p>
<p>
Therefore, why should we suppose that when Paul states that <font color= "blue">“Therefore let it be known to you that the salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles,” (Acts 28:28)</font> that something different from what has been going on throughout the book of Acts has started? In fact, quite to the contrary, what occurs in Acts 28:25-28 is following a pattern that actually starts with Paul's separation to the work God had called him (Acts 13:2) which was to open <font color= "blue">“the door of faith to the Gentiles” (Acts 14:27)</font>.</p>
<h3>
After Preaching the Gospel to the Jews and Gentiles
</h3>
<p>
What happened one Sabbath following Paul's initial preaching of the gospel to both Jews and Gentiles in Antioch of Pyxidia? Here's the account:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy; and contradicting and blaspheming, they opposed the things spoken by Paul. Then Paul and Barnabas grew bold and said, “It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken to you first; but since you reject it, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles. For so the Lord has commanded us: "I have set you as a light to the Gentiles, that you should be for salvation to the ends of the earth.” Now when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and glorified the word of the Lord. And as many as had been appointed to eternal life believed. (Acts 13:45-48)</font></p>
<h3>
Warnings
</h3>
<p>
It's not without significance to note that earlier in Acts 13:6-12 in Paphos, the first event recorded about Paul's ministry to the Gentiles was a miracle involving the blinding of a hindering Jew and the salvation of a believing Gentile. Isn't that a picture of what we see in the above account and doesn't this tie in nicely with the mystery of the “olive tree” in Rom 11:25?
Earlier in Acts 13:41, at the end of his message, Paul quotes the following Old Testament passage as a warning to the Jews he had spoken to:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Look among the nations and watch — be utterly astounded! For I will work a work in your days which you would not believe, though it were told you. (Hab 1:5)</font></p>
So, in response to unbelieving Jews who were required to hear God's word first, having been warned of the consequences of unbelief, Paul turns to the Gentiles in fulfilment of another Old Testament prophecy:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Indeed He says, "It is too small a thing that You should be My Servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved ones of Israel; I will also give You as a light to the Gentiles, that You should be My salvation to the ends of the earth.” (Isa 49:6)</font></p>
<p>
Later in Acts 18:5-6, we see the same pattern once again applied by Paul. This time Paul alludes to the following passage from the prophet Ezekiel in the Old Testament:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; therefore hear a word from My mouth, and give them warning from Me: When I say to the wicked, "You shall surely die," and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life, that same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand. Yet, if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul. “Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die; because you did not give him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand. Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man that the righteous should not sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live because he took warning; also you will have delivered your soul.” (Ezek 3:17-21)</font></p>
Notice that once again, a warning is given to Israel of impending danger. Here Paul is acting in the role of the watchman. However, since he has provided proper warning to the unbelieving Jews he is clean.
But why does Paul once again proclaim <font color= "blue">“From now on I will go to the Gentiles.” (Acts 18:6)</font></p>?
It's clear that after stating this to the Jews in Antioch of Pisidia he still proclaimed Christ to the Jews afterwards. Another example of this is found when he goes to Thessalonica:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews. Then Paul, as his custom was, went in to them, and for three Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures, explaining and demonstrating that the Christ had to suffer and rise again from the dead, and saying, “This Jesus whom I preach to you is the Christ.” (Acts 17:1-3)</font></p>
<p>
So why the repetition? Paul is now Achaia, a territory further west from Antioch of Pisidia which is Galatia.
So what's really different in Acts 28:23-28? The pattern found in both Acts 13 and 18 is once again repeated. Now Paul is even further west than Achaia, he is in Rome.
However, there is one important difference between Paul's ministry to the Jews at Rome and his previous ministry to the Jews in both Antioch of Pisidia and Achaia. This time instead of a warning, Paul is pronouncing judgement on Israel and as a result, Israel is in danger of being set aside!
However, does the potential of Israel being set aside require the immediate setting aside of their hope particularly because at that time the mystery of the “olive tree” is in play and the <font color= "blue">
“fullness of the Gentiles”</font> (Rom 11:25-26) must come in before the ultimate salvation of Israel can occur?
In addition, is it necessary to conclude that once the sentence is pronounced, the execution of that sentence must be immediately carried out? Or carried out at all if they yet repent?</p>
<p>
Another note is the final word translated "no man forbidding him". Why? Potentially because the Jews are now set aside which had been the ones who were withstanding Paul's ministry to the Gentiles, where we read <font color= "blue">
"forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they may be saved, so as always to fill up the measure of their sins; but wrath has come upon them to the uttermost." (Thess 2:14-16)</font></p>
