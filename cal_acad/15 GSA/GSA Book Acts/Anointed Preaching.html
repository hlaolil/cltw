Anointed Preaching
</h1>
<p>
The anointing isn’t in numbers. We place so much importance on church size today, yet God doesn’t seem impressed by crowds. I have nothing against mega churches as long as they preach the gospel—and many of them do a better job of it than small churches. But we’re headed for disaster if we think seating capacity alone reflects God’s approval.</p>
<p>
The anointing isn’t in eloquence. Some people have an uncanny way with words (including non-Christian motivational speakers), but persuasive skill isn’t the same as spiritual anointing. The dew of heaven is holy. It brings conviction and repentance—not self-awareness and an ego boost. And true preaching does not exalt the preacher—it crucifies him and focuses all attention on the Son of God.</p>
<p>
The anointing isn’t in looks. In today’s cool evangelical scene, rock star pastors are expected to be sexy, and everyone in the praise team needs trendy clothes. There’s nothing wrong with dressing to reach your audience, but I hope we don’t think the Holy Spirit is impressed with hipness.<br> The dowdy grandmother wearing orthopaedic shoes might have a word from the Lord for the congregation—but will we allow her on the stage?</p>
<p>
The anointing isn’t in technology. I love to use digital graphics when preaching. But some of the most anointed meetings I’ve been in were in Third World countries where we didn’t even have reliable electricity, much less computers and projectors. When genuine anointing falls on a preacher, he or she can talk for two hours without having to entertain.</p>
<p>
The anointing isn’t in emotionalism. In many churches today, lack of anointing creates a vacuum that is filled by screaming, swooning and other forms of religious theatre. It doesn’t matter what is preached—it is “anointed” as long as the preacher punctuates it with enough volume and the people shout back.<br>(One preacher I know had everyone shouting while she quoted lines from a Beyoncé song!)<br> Remember: Back slidden Israel shouted so loud that the earth quaked, but by the end of the day the Philistines had plundered them (see 1 Sam. 4:5-11).</p>
<p>
The anointing isn’t in contrived manifestations. I love it when the Holy Spirit does miracles. But when people fake the supernatural in order to get an audience response (or a big offering), I run for the door. If we had the fear of God we would never pretend to have the anointing by jerking, slurring words, stretching the facts in a testimony or sprinkling glitter on ourselves.</p>
<p>
Charles Spurgeon referred to the Holy Spirit’s anointing as “unction (anointing with oil),” and he said of it: “Unction is a thing which you cannot manufacture, and its counterfeits are worse than worthless.” <br>Let’s turn away from every false anointing and ask the God who answered Gideon to soak us with His heavenly power.</p>
