Fingerprints of the Invisible Church
</h1>
<p>
What was the first church in Acts 2:42-47 like? 
It was:
A learning church: Devotion to the apostle's Gospel teaching (Acts 2:42).
A loving church: Devotion to fellowship (Acts 2:42-45).
A worshipping church: Devotion to corporate worship (Acts 2:47). 
An evangelistic church: A witnessing church (Acts 2:41,47).
A praying church: The breaking of bread, and in prayers (Acts 2:42)</p>

1. A Learning Church</font></p>
<p>
"They devoted themselves to the apostle's teaching..." (Acts 2:42)(which today is our Bible). The Holy Spirit opened a school with 3,000 pupils (Acts 2:41). They committed to learning. They did not simply enjoy mystical experiences, become anti-intellectual, nor did they dispense with human teachers. They learned God's revelation of Himself from the apostles, who authenticated their teaching with "many wonders and signs" (Acts 2:43; Heb 2:3-4). Miraculous signs confirmed the truth of God's word and helped the Christians to devote themselves to it. A church submits to the authority and instruction, not primarily of their human leaders, but of the Scriptures.</p>

2. A Loving Church</font></p>
<p>
"They devoted themselves...to fellowship..."  (Acts 2:42). 
Koinonia bears witness to the common life of the church by having fellowship in two senses:
with the Father, Son (1 John 1:3) and Holy Spirit (2 Cor 13:14); and
with other Christians.
"All the believers were together and had everything in common" (Acts 2:44), even by voluntarily selling their homes (Acts 2:45), though not everyone did (Acts 12:12, 17:5, 18:7, 20:20, 21:8,16; Rom 16:5). Their fellowship was intense. It called for responsibility and accountability, and others had a claim on their time, their life and their resources. They met "every day" (Acts 2:46). Their intimacy was with a few in a house church/small group.</p>

3. A Worshipping Church</font></p>
<p> 
It was also reverent, for "everyone was filled with awe" (Acts 2:43)--probably in large group worship--and joyful, as they "ate together with glad and sincere hearts" (Acts 2:46)--probably in small group worship.
It is unforgivable for a church to be boring! The combination of joy and awe, as of formality and informality, is a healthy balance in worship.

4. An Evangelistic Church</font></p>
<p> 
They experienced conversions "daily." The early church's evangelism was not an occasional or sporadic activity. Just as their worship was daily (Acts 2:46a), so was their witness. Acts 2:47b says, "And the Lord added to their number daily those who were being saved." The first Christians were not so preoccupied with learning, sharing and worshipping that they forgot about witnessing. Through out Acts, relentlessly the Holy Spirit drives the church to witness, and churches continually rise out of the witness. Surely, God added to their number because of:

the preaching/teaching of the apostles,
the witness of the church members,
the impressive love of their common life, and
their example of "praising God and enjoying the favour of all the people" (Acts 2:47a).
Only God can cause his church to grow (Matt 16:18; 1 Cor 3:6). There is no place for self-confidence or triumphalism, as if the growth of the church were up to us Christians.</p>

A Praying Church
"... in the breaking of bread and in prayers"  (Acts 2:42,46) 
This suggests a reference to the Lord's Supper and to services or meetings, which was both formal and informal, taking place both "in the temple courts" and "in their homes".</p>

The marks of the first Spirit-filled church community were all concerned with the church's relationships:

To the apostle's teaching (in submission), which is our Bible.
To each other (in love). They were a loving, caring, sharing church.
To God (in worship). They worshipped daily (Acts 2:46).
To the world (in outreach). They were engaged in continuous evangelism. No inward-focused church can claim to be filled with the Spirit.
What people want is what the early church had:
Biblical teaching
Loving fellowship
Living worship
Ongoing, outgoing evangelism.</p>
