Acts of the Risen Christ

<h2 align="center">
Evidences and Minimal Facts
</h2>
<p><font color= "blue">
"... to whom He also presented Himself alive after His suffering by many 

infallible proofs, being seen by them during forty days and speaking of the 

things pertaining to the kingdom of God." (Acts 1:3)</font><br>
We will address many of the other evidences that Jesus rose from the dead, 

which are either described in Scripture or derived from it. We will also 

survey what have been called the minimal facts to show what would happen if 

we were to use the critics own criteria.</p>
<h3>
Evidences that Jesus Rose
</h3>
<p>
The Bible describes several pieces of evidence that are consistent with the 

belief that Jesus rose from the dead. Some of these evidences are explicitly 

stated in the text, while others are based on strong inferences drawn from 

the text. <br>As such, some of these points are more convincing than others, but 

taken together with the “infallible proofs,” there is only one reasonable 

conclusion: Jesus rose physically from the dead.</p>
<h3>
Conversion of James
</h3>
<p>
The man who wrote the Epistle of James was the half-brother of Jesus, the 

son of Mary and Joseph, and an early leader of the church in Jerusalem. <br>For 

whatever reason, James did not believe in Jesus as the Messiah prior to the 

Resurrection. In fact, none of His brothers believed in Him early on (John 

7:5), and even tried to prevent Him from speaking, thinking He was out of 

His mind (Mark 3:20–21). However, just several weeks after the Crucifixion 

they were counted among His followers (Acts 1:14).<br> By the time of the 

“Jerusalem Council” in Acts 15, James was one of the leading figures at the 

church in Jerusalem.<br> Paul seems to imply this as well in Gal 1:18–19 and 

2:9.<br> Several early sources reveal that James was eventually martyred for his 

faith.</p>
<p>
What could compel a man who had grown up with Jesus to suddenly change his 

mind about his older brother? James likely remained in his unbelief until 

after Christ’s death. After all, while He was on the Cross, Jesus entrusted 

the care of His mother to the Apostle John (John 19:26–27). If one of his 

brothers had been a believer at this point, it would have been their 

responsibility to care for Mary. Although Scripture does not describe the 

conversion of James for us, it does provide the most likely cause for his 

drastic change of heart.<br> Upon telling his readers that Jesus appeared to 

over 500 people at once, Paul wrote, <font color= "blue">“After that 

He was seen by James” (1 Cor 15:7).</font></p>
<p>
While it is possible that James converted to the faith based on reports of 

his brother’s Resurrection, it is far more likely that he became a believer 

when Jesus appeared to him. Whatever it was that triggered his conversion, 

James believed in the Resurrection so strongly that he was willing to die 

for his faith.</p>
<h3>
Conversion of Saul/Paul
</h3>
<p>
The Apostle Paul (also called Saul) is responsible for penning at least 13 

books of the New Testament and is arguably the most influential Christian 

ever. <br>But he was not always a devout follower of Christ. We are first 

introduced to him observing the stoning of Stephen (Acts 7:58). A few verses 

later we read that Saul<font color= "blue"> “made havoc of the church, 

entering every house, and dragging off men and women, committing them to 

prison” (Acts 8:3)</font>.<br>He would later tell an angry crowd in Jerusalem 

that he persecuted Christians <font color= "blue">“to the death, binding and 

delivering into prisons both men and women” <br>(Acts 22:4)</font>.<br> He wrote 

that he <font color= "blue">“persecuted the church of God beyond measure and 

tried to destroy it” (Gal 1:13).</font></p>
<p>
From a human perspective, this is not the person we would select to carry 

the gospel message throughout the Roman Empire, but God had other plans for 

Paul. <br>Acts 9 opens with the following words:<br><font color= "blue"> “Then Saul, 

still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went 

to the high priest and asked letters from him to the synagogues of Damascus, 

so that if he found any who were of the Way, whether men or women, he might 

bring them bound to Jerusalem” (Acts 9:1–2)</font>.<br> Paul was the church’s 

greatest persecutor, but he was about to see the Light (pun intended).</p>
<p>
As Paul approached Damascus, Jesus appeared to him and asked,<br> <font color= 

"blue">“Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?” (Acts 9:4)</font>.<br> Upon seeing the 

risen Saviour, Saul converted to the Christian faith and tirelessly preached 

the gospel—Christ’s death for sins, burial, and Resurrection—until his 

martyrdom many years later. The apostle described some of the trials he 

endured for Christ:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"... in labours more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more 

frequently, in deaths often. From the Jews five times I received forty 

stripes minus one. Three times I was beaten with rods; once I was stoned; 

three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I have been in the deep; in 

journeys often, in perils of waters, in perils of robbers, in perils of my 

own countrymen, in perils of the Gentiles, in perils in the city, in perils 

in the wilderness, in perils in the sea, in perils among false brethren, in 

weariness and toil, in sleeplessness often, in hunger and thirst, in 

fastings often, in cold and nakedness ..." <br>(2 Cor 11:23–27)</font></p>
<p>
What could possibly explain such a drastic change of heart? This was not a 

foolish man who could be swayed by poor argumentation, nor was he prone to 

changing his views based on shifting public opinion. Paul was a scholar and 

a well-respected Pharisee. But he was suddenly transformed into a fearless 

evangelist and church planter who suffered greatly for preaching the gospel 

before Jews and Gentiles, kings, civil leaders, and commoners.</p>
<p>
The only reasonable explanation for this change of heart is precisely what 

Paul said it was:<font color= "blue"> “Then last of all He was seen by me 

also,” (1 Cor 15:8)</font>.<br> Paul was so committed to serving Christ that he 

was beheaded in Rome during Nero’s reign. His treatise on the absolute 

necessity of the Resurrection for the Christian faith in 1 Cor 15 

demonstrates this former Pharisee’s undying commitment to the gospel of 

Christ.</p>
<h3>
The Change in the Disciples
</h3>
<p>
James and Paul were not the only people to undergo drastic changes.<br> On the 

night Jesus was arrested, His disciples fled in fear (Mark 14:50).<br> As far as 

we know, only John had the courage to remain close enough to Jesus to 

observe some of the proceedings up to and including the Crucifixion <br>(John 

18:15; 19:26). <br>Peter attempted to stay with Jesus but ended up denying 

Christ several times before fleeing in shame (Matt 26:69–75).</p>
<p>
Less than two months later, Peter stood in front of thousands of Jews in 

Jerusalem and boldly delivered one of the least “seeker-sensitive” messages 

of all time.<br>He declared that they <font color= "blue">"... have taken by 

lawless hands, have crucified, and put to death; whom God raised up, ...” 

(Acts 2:23)</font> their Messiah. <br>It’s difficult to imagine how offensive 

Peter’s words would have been to such a crowd. These people had been longing 

for the Messiah to come, but when He came, they failed to recognise Him 

(Luke 19:41–44; Acts 3:17; 1 Cor 2:8). Instead of welcoming Him with open 

arms, they had delivered Him to be executed by one of the most brutal means 

imaginable—crucifixion.</p>
<p>
But Peter and the disciples weren’t done. After healing a crippled man in 

the name of Jesus, Peter soon spoke to another large crowd of Jews in the 

temple. He unflinchingly proclaimed, <font color= "blue">“But you denied the 

Holy One and the Just, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, and 

killed the Prince of life, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are 

witnesses” (Acts 3:14–15)</font>.</p>
<p>
The disciples were arrested and on the next day they stood before <font 

color= "blue">“their rulers, elders, and scribes, 6 as well as Annas the 

high priest, Caiaphas, John, and Alexander, ...” (Acts 4:5–6)</font>.<br> What 

was Peter’s message?<font color= "blue"> “Let it be known to you all, and to 

the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you 

crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by Him this man stands here before 

you whole.<br> Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name 

under heaven given among men by which we must be saved” (Acts 4:10, 

12)</font>. <br>The disciples were commanded by the authorities to stop 

preaching in the name of Jesus (Acts 4:18), but they replied, <font color= 

"blue">“Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you more than 

to God, you judge. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and 

heard” (Acts 4:19–20)</font>.<br> Upon their release and following a prayer for 

boldness, we are told,<br><font color= "blue"> “And with great power the 

apostles gave witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus” (Acts 

4:33)</font>.</p>
<p>
In the next chapter of Acts, the disciples were arrested and imprisoned, 

miraculously freed by an angel, and taken into custody again.<br> They refused 

to stop preaching and told the council, <font color= "blue">“We ought to 

obey God rather than men. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you 

murdered by hanging on a tree” (Acts 5:29-30)</font>.</p>
<p>
According to church tradition, all of the disciples except for John suffered 

a martyr’s death because they continually preached what they had seen and 

heard: Jesus was crucified, but now He was alive again because God had 

raised Him from the dead. James, the brother of John, was killed by Herod 

with the sword (Acts 12:2). An early church tradition records that Peter was 

crucified upside down, which is consistent to what Jesus told him in John 

21:18–19. <br>Early church tradition also holds that the other disciples 

suffered martyrdom in various manners: spearing, flaying, crucifixion, the 

sword, and boiling oil.</p>
<p>
The book of Acts makes it pretty clear why these men who fled in fear on the 

night Jesus was arrested were willing to die for Him. They were filled with 

the Spirit (Acts 2:4; 4:8), and they knew that even though Jesus had died, 

He was alive and well. They had seen Him with their own eyes and touched Him 

with their own hands (1 John 1:1–3), and only death could silence them.</p>
<p>
Scoffers have attempted to downplay this remarkable proof of the 

Resurrection by claiming that many people are willing to die for a cause. <br>

For example, some Muslims are willing to blow themselves up to kill Jews.<br> 

That’s true, but it misses the point. The Muslims who do this sort of thing 

sincerely believe in their cause, but they do not know if it’s true. <br>The 

disciples were in a position to know whether or not Jesus was raised from 

the dead. It simply is not plausible to suggest that each of these men would 

face continual persecution and horrifying deaths for something they knew to 

be a lie. After all, liars don’t make good martyrs. And in contrast to 

suicide bombers, the disciples didn’t kill others in their respective 

martyrdoms. And they didn’t use violence to force people to convert to 

Christianity. In fact, they did no harm to anyone, but loved their enemies 

and willingly accepted persecution from them for the sake of the gospel.</p>
<h3>
The Empty Tomb
</h3>
<p>
Jesus was buried in the tomb of a council member from Arimathaea named 

Joseph (John 19:38–42).<br> All four Gospels testify to this fact. The tomb was 

guarded by Roman soldiers, and a Roman seal was affixed to it (Matt 27:62–

66). If Jesus was bodily resurrected from the dead, then we would expect 

that His body would not remain in the tomb. Of course, that’s precisely what 

was discovered on the Sunday morning after the Crucifixion—His body was gone 

and only the burial cloths remained.</p>
<p>
The fact that the tomb was empty has led to numerous imaginative alternative 

views. If the Lord’s body was still in the tomb on the Day of Pentecost when 

Peter preached in Jerusalem, the Jewish leaders could have grabbed Peter, 

taken him to the tomb, and said, “Look, there’s Jesus. He didn’t rise from 

the dead. Now stop lying to everyone about it.” Yet, there is not a single 

ancient record of this sort. Instead, the Jewish leaders who opposed 

Christianity invented the incredible idea that the disciples stole the body 

to explain away the empty tomb (Matt 28:11–15).</p>
<p>
The fact that the opponents of the early Christians acknowledged the empty 

tomb lends authenticity to the accounts, since a person’s enemies are 

unlikely to help him make his case. This is known as the principle of enemy 

attestation or the testimony of a hostile witness. “If opponents of the 

eyewitnesses admit certain facts the eyewitnesses say are true, then those 

facts probably are true (for example, if your mother says you are brave, 

that might be true; but it’s probably more credible if your arch enemy says 

the same thing).”</p>
<h3>
The Existence of the Church
</h3>
<p>
Philip and David Schley Schaff stated, “The Christian church rests on the 

resurrection of its Founder. Without this fact the church could never have 

been born, or if born, it would soon have died a natural death.” <br>After an 

exhaustive study of early Christian beliefs about the Resurrection, <br>N.T. 

Wright wrote, “Christianity is inexplicable apart from the assumption that 

virtually all early Christians ... did indeed believe that Jesus of Nazareth 

had been raised bodily from the dead.”</p>
<p>
Due to the remarkable circumstances in first-century Jerusalem, Christianity 

would have never been able to get started if Jesus had not risen from the 

dead. Recall that the Resurrection of Jesus was central to the disciples 

preaching. <br>Even if they had the courage to preach without having seen the 

risen Lord, what message would they have proclaimed? They certainly could 

not repeatedly claim to have been eyewitnesses of His Resurrection, as they 

did <br>(Acts 2:32; 3:15; 5:32; 10:39; 13:31).<br> Without this bold proclamation of 

the Resurrection, and if His body was rotting in the grave, people would not 

be converted and the memory of Jesus and His disciples would quickly fade. 

In fact, it may be safely said that if Jesus did not rise from the dead, 

very few people living today, if any, would have ever heard of Him.</p>
<h3>
Undivided Testimony of New Testament
</h3>
<p>
As could be expected, the New Testament writers were undivided in their 

proclamation that Jesus rose from the dead. Space does not permit an 

exhaustive treatment of the subject here, but consider that the Resurrection 

is explicitly mentioned in every New Testament book except for the short 

letters of Philemon, James, 2 Peter, 2 John, 3 John, and Jude. Yet even 

these letters assume the truth of the Resurrection since Jesus is portrayed 

as living and active. So from the penning of the earliest New Testament book 

to the final one, the Resurrection of Jesus is consistently viewed as 

central to Christian teaching.</p>
<h3>
Principle of Embarrassment
</h3>
<p>
A key idea used by historians in weighing the historical validity of alleged 

events has been called the principle of embarrassment. That is, if the 

writer included details that would seem to hurt his position, then those 

details are likely true, since one would not readily undercut his own 

beliefs with certain data that could just as easily be left unreported. 

Applied to the topic at hand, this principle does not directly relate to the 

Resurrection, but it does relate indirectly since it provides multiple clues 

that the eyewitness accounts are authentic.</p>
<p>
The Bible includes numerous embarrassing details about its leading figures. <br>

For example, David was an adulterer and murderer (2 Sam 11).<br> Peter was 

accused of being a mouthpiece of Satan by Jesus when Peter denied that Jesus 

would be killed in Jerusalem and rise again (Matt 16:23).<br> Later, despite his 

promises to the contrary, Peter denied Jesus several times (Luke 22:31–35, 

54–62 ). When it comes to the Resurrection accounts in the Gospels, the 

writers included some embarrassing details that actually afford credibility 

to their extraordinary claim that Jesus rose from the dead.</p>
<p>
If the disciples were inventing Christianity, as has been alleged by some 

critics and sceptics, then surely they could have made up a more respectable 

story. They could have claimed that the first witnesses of the empty tomb 

and the risen Christ were respected men like Nicodemus, Joseph of 

Arimathaea, and perhaps some other members of the Sanhedrin. Maybe they 

could have said that Jesus appeared to Herod, Pilate, or even the emperor 

himself. That would be impressive. But what does Scripture tell us about the 

first witnesses of these things? They were women—at least five of them 

travelled to the tomb early on Easter morning (Luke 24:10). Given that a 

woman’s testimony was not highly valued in that patriarchal society, it 

would make no sense for the writers to include this detail if they were 

attempting to gain a following—unless it was true.</p>
<p>
This information is even more embarrassing when we consider who the very 

first eyewitness was. Who in their right mind would ever make up the idea 

that Mary Magdalene was the first person to see the risen Saviour? By this 

time Mary was surely a devoted follower of Christ, but she would have 

virtually zero credibility with anyone outside of the disciples circle, and 

even they didn’t initially believe her report (Luke 24:11).<br> After all, this 

was a woman <font color= "blue">“out of whom had come seven demons” (Luke 

8:2).</font> That the biblical writers assign Mary Magdalene as the first 

eyewitness of the resurrected Christ lends strong support for the 

truthfulness of the account.</p>
<h3>
The Nazareth Inscription
</h3>
<p>
An interesting archaeological discovery lends early support to the biblical 

accounts of the Resurrection. The Nazareth Inscription is a marble tablet 

with Greek writing that has been dated to approximately AD 41. The 

inscription is likely an abbreviated form of an edict (called a rewrite) 

from Emperor Claudius.</p>
<p>
The wording of this particular find indicates that the message of the 

Resurrection, or at least the Jewish response to it, had been brought to the 

emperor’s attention within about ten years of the event. In just fourteen 

brief lines this rewrite explains a new law carrying capital punishment for 

anyone who would move a body from graves or tombs to another place with 

wicked intent. That is, no one was permitted to move an entombed body for 

fraudulent reasons.</p>
<p>
Why is this so intriguing? Think about the response of the Jewish leaders to 

the Resurrection reports. <br>They bribed the Roman soldiers to say, <font 

color= "blue">“His disciples came at night and stole Him away while we 

slept” (Matt 28:13)</font>. <br>Why would the Roman emperor issue an edict 

forbidding the moving of a body with fraudulent intent? Sure, there were 

grave robbers at that time, but grave robbers weren’t interested in stealing 

bodies—they wanted the valuables occasionally buried with the body. 

Interestingly enough, there is no mention of valuables in the edict, but 

there is a comment forbidding the moving of sepulchre-sealing stones. These 

types of stones were only used in Israel, so the wording of this edict 

pinpoints the reason for its issuance. Something had happened in Israel 

concerning the reported moving of a body that had caused enough ripples 

throughout the empire to merit the attention of the emperor.</p>
<p>
The Nazareth Inscription does not prove that Jesus rose from the dead, but 

it is consistent with the biblical accounts. It also gives extra-biblical 

testimony to the growing impact of the church and its central message of the 

Resurrection soon after Christ’s death.</p>
<h3>
Subjective Evidences
</h3>
<p>
My favourite song as a young boy mentions a remarkable, though subjective 

evidence that Jesus is alive today. The chorus of “He Lives” closes with the 

words, “You ask me how I know He lives, He lives within my heart.” This may 

sound strange to an unbeliever, but Christians can testify to significant, 

positive life-change as a result of trusting in the risen Christ. People 

from every nation, from all walks of life, all levels of age or education or 

material prosperity, all religious backgrounds, and all kinds of moral or 

immoral lifestyles can testify to a radical change of values, priorities, 

relationships, and purpose in life as a result of trusting in Jesus Christ 

as Saviour and Lord. Drunks, violent men, prostitutes, addicts, and filthy 

perverts have found victory from sin through the Lord Jesus Christ. The 

Bible explains that by His life-giving Spirit Jesus dwells in the hearts of 

believers through faith (Eph 3:17) to gradually transform their lives to be 

like Christ (Rom 12:2; 2 Cor 3:18; 5:17; Eph 2:8–10).</p>
<p>
Again, this evidence is subjective, and I wouldn’t expect anyone to start 

believing in the Resurrection based solely on someone’s personal experience. 

But changed lives are exactly what we would expect if the one who claimed to 

forgive sin and give eternal life in relationship with God really did rise 

from the dead. Conversely, if Jesus didn’t rise from the dead, it is very 

difficult to explain so many changed lives down through the centuries.</p>
<p>
Like James and Paul, other former sceptics have been persuaded that 

Christianity is true based largely on their attempts to disprove the faith, 

particularly the Resurrection. Some of the most popular Christian 

apologists, such as Josh McDowell, Lee Strobel, and C.S. Lewis, have 

testified that their attempts to disprove the Resurrection of Jesus were 

integral to their conversion.</p>
<p>
While God is the only one who can supernaturally change a person’s heart, He 

often uses the “infallible proofs” and other evidences of the Resurrection 

to remove intellectual objections to the Christian faith.<br> John Whitcomb 

explained that in the account of Jesus raising Lazarus from the dead, it was 

God who did the supernatural work (raising Lazarus), but He commanded people 

to move the sepulchre-sealing stone (John 11:39) and unwrap Lazarus (John 

11:46). Many of the Jews believed in Jesus when they saw this incredible 

miracle (John 11:45), and the chief priests <font color= "blue">“plotted to 

put Lazarus to death also, because on account of him many of the Jews went 

away and believed in Jesus” (John 12:10–11)</font>. <br>In a sense, that’s how 

these evidences for the Resurrection of Christ can be used. Figuratively, we 

can roll away the stones of objections so that people can see the risen 

Lord.</p>
<h3>
Minimal Facts
</h3>
<p>
The Bible is the Word of God, so it is accurate in all it affirms. Since it 

tells us Jesus rose from the dead, we can have complete confidence that He 

did.<br>What many people fail to recognise is that even when we use the 

sceptics own criteria, the most reasonable conclusion is the same: Jesus 

rose from the dead.</p>
