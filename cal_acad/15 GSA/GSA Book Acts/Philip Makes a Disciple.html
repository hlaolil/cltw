   <h1>
Philip Makes a Disciple
</h1>
<h3>
An angel directs Philip to Gaza
</h3>
<p>
Philip’s role in Samaria was over, but he was about to play another important part in spreading of the gospel. An angelic messenger appeared to Philip and instructed him: <font color= "blue">“go toward the south along the road which goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza” (Acts 8:26)</font>. Commentators point out that when Luke wanted to stress the presence and activity of God, he often used an expression like “the angel of the Lord” (as he does in Acts 8:26) rather than “the Spirit of the Lord.” Used here, the expression is a vivid way of describing Philip’s divine guidance.</p>
<p>
This was another opportunity for Luke to stress that the evangelistic work of the church is initiated by God, who sends His divine messenger to Philip.<br> Whatever mission work Philip is about to do is not based on a program the church has thought out. After all, in this case, what would be the point of travelling to a “desert road” that leads to Gaza, and preach the gospel there?</p>
<p>
But that’s what Philip was told to do — go down the road that leads to the edge of the desert. (The road from Jerusalem to Gaza is 50 miles long, and leads to the main coastal trade route going to Egypt.) Commentators point out that the word “desert” in Luke’s account can refer either to Gaza or to the road.<br> Most likely the former is in view here. Apparently, the old town of Gaza is referred to as “Desert Gaza,” in distinction to a newer town named Gaza.<br> This is the southernmost of the five main Philistine cites in south western Judea. It is also the last settlement before a traveller encounters the barren desert stretching to Egypt.
<h3>
The Ethiopian Official 
</h3>
<p>
As Philip travelled the road to “Desert Gaza,” he met an Ethiopian eunuch. <br>
This man was what we might call the Secretary of the Treasury or the Chancellor Exchequer for Candace, the Ethiopian queen (Acts 8:27). As a minister of finance, he was an important official in the queen’s “cabinet.”<br> The Ethiopians were Nubians, living in Southern Egypt and the Sudan, between modern Aswan and Khartoum. (The modern nation of Ethiopia is further south.) Candace  was a dynastic title, such as Pharaoh, not a personal name. <br>All Ethiopian queens had that name. According to ancient writers, the Nubian king was said to be too holy to become involved with profane matters of state, so the mother of the king ruled on behalf of her son.</p>
<p>
Luke says the eunuch went <font color= "blue">“to Jerusalem to worship” (Acts 8:27)</font>.<br> Therefore, though he was probably a Gentile, he was most likely a proselyte or “God-fearer.” This is indicated by the fact that the eunuch made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and was studying the book of Isaiah. (It would be difficult for a non-Jew to get a copy of the Isaiah scroll, but a minister of finance would no doubt have more ability than the average Gentile.)</p>
<p>
Israel’s law excluded the sexually deformed from being able to <br><font color= "blue">“enter the assembly of the Lord” (Deut 23:1)</font>, and eunuchs were not allowed in the innermost court of the temple. Yet, Isaiah predicts a time when this ban would be removed (Isa 56:3-5). It’s not clear how first-century Judaism regarded eunuchs, and whether they are allowed even in the outermost courts. Some commentators feel that Luke does not mean to say that the Ethiopian is truly a “eunuch.”</p>
<p>
Other commentators disagree. They point out that both the word “eunuch” and “official” describe the Ethiopian in the same verse (8:27). If “eunuch” simply means “official” here, then Luke would be redundant. Because Luke used both terms in the same sentence, it seems he intends us to understand that the Ethiopian is sexually mutilated, or a eunuch. In ancient times it was common for male servants of a queen to be eunuchs.</p>
<h3>
Eunuch Baptised 
</h3>
<p>
As Philip, at the behest of the Spirit, ran up to the Ethiopian eunuch’s chariot, he heard him reading from the book of Isaiah (Acts 8:32-33). It was hardly an accident that at the precise moment of Philip’s arrival the Ethiopian was reading a passage that made him open to the good news about Jesus. The Ethiopian was reading from the Suffering Servant section in Isa 53. As Philip approached the chariot, the eunuch asked him whether the prophet was talking about himself or someone else (Acts 8:34).</p>
<p>
Philip immediately takes advantage of this God-given opportunity.<br><font color= "blue"> “Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning at this Scripture, preached Jesus to him.” (Acts 8:35)</font>. <br>Jesus quoted from Isa 53, saying it would be fulfilled in His death (Luke 22:37). Now, Philip was preaching the same message. Philip, like Peter, apparently told the eunuch that anyone who accepts Jesus as Messiah should be baptised for the remission of sins, and will be filled with the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38). <br>Thus, when somewhere along the road the Ethiopian saw water (a rarity in this area, except for the Mediterranean Sea), he asked for baptism.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
So he commanded the chariot to stand still. And both Philip and the eunuch went down into the water, and he baptised him.” (Acts 8:38)</font>. <br>The phrase “went down into” implies that the baptism was done by immersion. Jesus himself was baptised this way (Mark 1:9-10). The fact that the official went <font color= "blue">“on his way rejoicing” (Acts 8:39)</font> indicates that he had received the Holy Spirit. Luke often saw joy as a response to God’s work in the world.<br> [Luke 1:14, 28; 2:10; 6:23; 8:13; 10:17, 20; 13:17; 15:5, 7, 10, 32; 19:6, 37; 24:41, 52.]</p>
<p>
Africa had now been reached by the gospel in the person of the Ethiopian eunuch. In him, the prophecy was beginning to be fulfilled:<br> <font color= "blue">“Ethiopia will quickly stretch out her hands to God” (Psa 68:31)</font>.</p>
<p>
Most modern translations omit the following verse from the text and place it in a footnote, because the oldest manuscripts do not have this verse.<br> The verse reads: <font color= "blue">“Philip said, "If you believe with all your heart, you may."<br>The eunuch answered, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.” <br>(Acts 8:37)</font> <br>The verse simply makes explicit something that the other verses imply; it seems that an early scribe thought it should be more explicit, added it to the text, and many copyists followed suit.</p>
<p>
The evangelisation and baptism of a high-ranking Ethiopian represents another step in the advance of the gospel from its Jewish origins to a wider Gentile world. However, the church is still far from engaging in a full-bore missions effort directly to pagan Gentiles.</p>
