<h1>
Patterns of Pentecost - Lydia in Philippi
</h1>
<p>
Consider how Luke frames one particular incident just outside Philippi. Note the way that Paul and his team mates conduct themselves. I believe their interactions with those they meet in Philippi model in a concrete way what could be described as Christian conversion practice at its best.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Therefore, sailing from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and the next day came to Neapolis, and from there to Philippi, which is the foremost city of that part of Macedonia, a colony. And we were staying in that city for some days. And on the Sabbath day we went out of the city to the riverside, where prayer was customarily made; and we sat down and spoke to the women who met there. Now a certain woman named Lydia heard us. She was a seller of purple from the city of Thyatira, who worshipped God. The Lord opened her heart to heed the things spoken by Paul. And when she and her household were baptised, she begged us, saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay." So she persuaded us. (Acts 16:11-15)</font></p>
<p>
Luke is a masterful storyteller. He carefully and artfully casts the narrative with a purpose. While he aims to show that this interaction is routine, it is an interaction that throbs with what could be described as healthy conversion practice. Look with me at three characteristics of Paul and Silas' interaction with the people of Philippi.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
First</font></p>
<p>
Their interaction was relational. On the Sabbath, Paul and his travelling partners went looking for what must have been a small gathering of Jews that met informally outside the city gate. Two things are important to understand here. <br>
1) Philippi is in the Diaspora—this is a long way from the temple in Jerusalem and Jewish prayer groups like this would have been common. <br>
2) Until about the year 85, Jewish Christians, like Paul, moved easily between synagogue and house church. It would have been common for these early Jewish Christians to pray on Saturday, the Sabbath, and then to gather the next day for pot luck meal after work on Sunday, the first day of the week, to celebrate the resurrection.</p>
<p>
Furthermore, what is noteworthy here is that the good news that Paul proclaimed was not simply a “load of content” to be dropped off in a “take it or leave it” fashion. Instead, the gospel message is intimately tied to the relational dimension of salvation itself. Luke is careful to note that Paul and his associates found the Jewish prayer group, sat down with them, and spoke with the women.</p>
<p>
These actions are significant because they underscore the relational dimension of the Christian practice of calling for conversion. Not only were their methods relational, the message they presented was relational —they were representatives of a God who longs to participate with humanity to make things new. In the end, the story concludes with Paul and Silas accepting the hospitality of Lydia, the wealthy entrepreneur, underscoring the mutuality and reciprocity of the relationship. It is truly “give-and-take.”</p>
<p>
The Christian practice of calling to conversion is healthy when it is relational in its interaction and engagement with culture and people.</p>
<p>
While the relational dimension of faith may be fashionable, this is not why the Christian call to conversion should be relational. No. Christian witness is relational because that is the image of God that emerges from the Christian Bible. Emmanuel means “God with us,” with us in the struggle of life until the end of the age.</p>

<p>
The text shows that the interaction between Paul and the people of Philippi was collaborative. How does Luke identify Lydia? Religiously, Luke wants us to know that she worships God, but is not a Christian. Lydia is a seeker “listening” carefully to what Paul and his colleagues are saying about God’s final revelation in Jesus, the one who is victorious over death and makes it possible to imagine an alternative humanity. Note that according to Luke, God did not arrive for the first time with these missionaries, Paul and Silas. God had already been at work in the world, particularly through Israel. What Jesus did was gather and call Israel back to its original mandate to bring life to the nations. Recall God’s promise to Abraham, “I will make of you a great nation, and I bless you ... in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed” (Gen 12:2-3).</p>
<p>
The call to conversion is not about empire building. Instead, it announces and gives witness to what has already come, to what is visible in small, but significant ways, and to what is still to come. The call to conversion is very aware that the Reign of God is bigger than the church, that God has been at work long before the church arrived on the scene, and that some surprises are likely in order.</p>
<p>
The Hebrew Bible testifies that long before Jesus, God had already begun to call a people. It was as if God had hung up a sign in the window that read, “Help Wanted.” The responses of Abraham, Sarah, Moses, Miriam, David, Jeremiah, and Isaiah, to name a few, make it clear that the People of God was already off to a good start. However, in the New Testament we read about how Jesus uniquely responded to the “Help Wanted” ad by gathering and focusing Israel in view of the coming Reign of God. Jesus moved that People one massive step closer to being what God had always intended for it— namely, to be a blessing to the world, inviting the world to experience life, wholeness, and peace—ultimately, to be instrumental in the transformation of all creation.</p>
<p>
The Christian practice of calling to conversion is healthy when it is collaborative in its interaction and engagement with culture and people.</p>
<p>
Again, while collaboration may now be politically correct, this is not why a Christian call to conversion should be collaborative. No. Christian witness is collaborative because that is the image of God that emerges from the Christian Bible. God works together with people to make something good and beautiful.</p>

<p>
The interaction between Paul and the people of Philippi was invitational. Not only are Paul and Silas relational and collaborative, they also have something to say! As a sign of what God is about, the Christian church does have a message to proclaim. The message is one of inviting people to find their true identity in God.</p>
<p>
What does Paul say to these women? We are not told, but from the things we read of Paul elsewhere, it would be reasonable to assume that he tells them about finding one’s true identity as a child of God, by being included in the body of the Risen Lord. In other words, this is an invitation to abandon rebellion and the suffocating preoccupation with prestige, possessions, and power—the things that cause us to become all tangled up in ourselves. The gospel invitation is still the same; it is one of liberation from bondage and of finding our name as God’s beloved.</p>
<p>
Luke deliberately lets us know that Lydia is independent and an entrepreneur. He takes special care to mention that she is a person who has achieved a status in her society that puts her on par with a male householder. How do we know? Luke carefully points out that she is known for the products she sells and that she is known as the head of a household.</p>
<p>
Lydia was like other women in the early church who had achieved a certain status in society but were still marginalised by society. These women entrepreneurs found in the Christian gospel a way to have their identity affirmed as fully human participants in God’s new emerging society. This was attractive, though probably threatening to the status quo. The Christian gospel offered these entrepreneurial women identity affirmation to go along with their achieved status. Paul invited these marginalised women of means to join him in God’s mission of helping others know who they really are. And so Lydia is baptised, she and her household.</p>

The Christian practice of calling to conversion is healthy when it is invitational in its interaction and engagement with culture and people.</p>
