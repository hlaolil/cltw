"You know that because of physical infirmity I preached the gospel to you at the first" (Gal 4:13)</font></p>
<p>
The mention of a "first time" implies a second time before the letter was written. However, the phrase may idiomatically mean "formally" as in 1 Tim 1:13. Paul went to the churches of Galatia:<br>
1. for a time of recuperation from some illness<br>
2. because of an illness he had to stop and stay a while</p>
<p>
Because of:<br> 
(1) Gal 4:14-15;<br> 
(2) in tandem with Gal 6:11; and <br>
(3) 2 Cor 12:1-10. </p>
<p> 
I personally believe Paul is alluding to his "thorn in the flesh," a physical ailment. With the combination of these verses it seems to me that it was some type of eye problem which possibly began with his Damascus Road experience (cf. Acts 9) and was made worse by the diseases of the first century. Paul's partial blindness may have been caused by the repulsive eye disorder, ophthalmia.</p>

"And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise or reject" (Gal 4:14a)</font> </p>
<p>
Many Jews and Gentiles would have seen Paul's illness as a sin judgement from God. (We know the Holy spirit didn't want Paul to go to Asia) The fact that Paul was in God's will, and sick, forces us to do a rethink referring to:<br> 
(1) an unusual-looking eye or<br> 
(2) a wild-eyed look (epilepsy).</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"but you received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus" (Gal 4:14b)</font> </p>
<p>
A strong statement, Paul implied that they genuinely received the message of God through him, accompanied with great respect for the servant who brought it. </p>
<p>
"What then was the blessing you enjoyed" (Gal 4:15a)</font> </p>
<p>
In this rhetorical question, Paul wants to know where the original, positive feelings the Galatians held for him has gone. </p>
<p><font color= "blue">
For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes and given them to me." (Gal 4:15b)</font> </p>
<p>
This second class conditional sentence should be understood as, "If you had plucked out your eyes which you did not, you would have given them to me which you did not." This reading supports the theory that Paul's thorn in the flesh (cf. 2 Cor 12) was eye disease.</p>
