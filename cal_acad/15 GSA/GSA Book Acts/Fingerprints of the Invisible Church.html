Fingerprints of the Invisible Church
</h1>
<p>
What was the first church in Acts 2:42-47 like? </p>
<p>
It was:<br>
A learning church: Devotion to the apostle's Gospel teaching (Acts 2:42).<br>
A loving church: Devotion to fellowship (Acts 2:42-45).<br>
A worshipping church: Devotion to corporate worship (Acts 2:47). <br>
An evangelistic church: A witnessing church (Acts 2:41,47).<br>
A praying church: The breaking of bread, and in prayers (Acts 2:42)</p>
<p><font size="+1">
1. A Learning Church</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"they continued steadfastly in the apostles doctrine" (Acts 2:42)</font><br> (which today is our Bible). <br>The Holy Spirit opened a school with 3,000 pupils (Acts 2:41). They committed to learning. They did not simply enjoy mystical experiences, become anti-intellectual, nor did they dispense with human teachers. They learned God's revelation of Himself from the apostles, who authenticated their teaching with "many wonders and signs" (Acts 2:43; Heb 2:3-4).<br> Miraculous signs confirmed the truth of God's word and helped the Christians to devote themselves to it. A church submits to the authority and instruction, not primarily of their human leaders, but of the Scriptures.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
2. A Loving Church</font></p>
<p>
"they continued steadfastly in ... fellowship"  (Acts 2:42). 
Koinonia bears witness to the common life of the church by having fellowship in two senses: with the Father, Son (1 John 1:3) and Holy Spirit (2 Cor 13:14); and with other Christians.<br>
<font color= "blue">"all who believed were together, and had all things in common" (Acts 2:44)</font>, even by voluntarily selling their homes (Acts 2:45), though not everyone did (Acts 12:12, 17:5, 18:7, 20:20, 21:8,16; Rom 16:5). Their fellowship was intense. It called for responsibility and accountability, and others had a claim on their time, their life and their resources. <br>They met <font color= "blue">"continuing daily with one accord" (Acts 2:46)</font>. Their intimacy was with a few in a house church/small group.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
3. A Worshipping Church</font></p>
<p> 
It was also reverent, <font color= "blue">"worshipping in the temple" daily. (Acts 2:46)</font> probably in large group worship.<br> Joyful, as they<font color= "blue"> "ate their food with gladness and simplicity of heart" (Acts 2:46)</font> probably in small group worship.<br>
It is unforgivable for a church to be boring! The combination of joy and awe, as of formality and informality, is a healthy balance in worship.
<p><font size="+1">
4. An Evangelistic Church</font></p>
<p> 
They experienced conversions "daily." The early church's evangelism was not an occasional or sporadic activity. Just as their worship was daily so was their witness. <font color= "blue">"And the Lord added to the church daily those who were being saved." (Acts 2:46)</font>,<br> The first Christians were not so preoccupied with learning, sharing and worshipping that they forgot about witnessing. Through out Acts, relentlessly the Holy Spirit drives the church to witness, and churches continually rise out of the witness. Surely, God added to their number because of:<br>

the preaching/teaching of the apostles,<br>
the witness of the church members,<br>
the impressive love of their common life, and<br>
their example of "praising God and enjoying the favour of all the people" <br>(Acts 2:47).</p>
<p>
Only God can cause his church to grow (Matt 16:18; 1 Cor 3:6). There is no place for self-confidence or triumphalism, as if the growth of the church were up to us Christians.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
A Praying Church</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"... in the breaking of bread and in prayers"  (Acts 2:42,46)</font> <br>
This suggests a reference to the Lord's Supper and to services or meetings, which was both formal and informal, taking place both "in the temple courts" and "in their homes".</p>
<p>
The marks of the first Spirit-filled church community were all concerned with the church's relationships:<br>

To the apostle's teaching (in submission), which is our Bible.<br>
To each other (in love). They were a loving, caring, sharing church.<br>
To God (in worship). They worshipped daily (Acts 2:46).<br>
To God (in prayer) They prayed daily in the Temple and in homes.<br>
To the world (in outreach). They were engaged in continuous evangelism. </p>
<p>
No inward-focused church can claim to be filled with the Spirit.<br>
What people want is what the early church had:<br>
Biblical teaching<br>
Loving fellowship<br>
Living worship<br>
Ongoing, outgoing evangelism.<br>
Always praying
