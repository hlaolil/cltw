With Paul in Athens
</h2>
<h3>
Impression of the City 
</h3>
<p>
As Paul made his way south from Berea, he first visited Athens, somewhat east of Corinth. Thereby was created a tale of two cities—and two surprisingly opposite responses to God’s calling.</p>
<p>
Athens had been one of the great cities of the world. The notion of democracy had begun and was nourished here. The city had been home to such men as Socrates, Plato and Aristotle. The Athens Paul saw was a major centre of learning. Philosophy, literature, science and art flourished.</p>
<p>
But in the main, Athens was basking in a glorious past. The Athens of Paul’s day had lost both its empire and wealth. Historians estimate the population was about 10,000. Athens remained a small town into modern times. But it is now a bustling metropolis of more than three million.</p>
<p>
Athens was known as a centre of superstition when Paul entered its streets. William Barclay writes in his commentary on Acts, “It was said that there were more statues of the gods in Athens than in all the rest of Greece put together and that in Athens it was easier to meet a god than a man”. It’s not surprising that Paul became distressed with the city’s impoverished spiritual condition. Luke writes <font color= "blue">Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him when he saw that the city was given over to idols.” (Acts 17:16)</font></p>
<p>
Paul’s custom, as Acts 17:2 indicates, was to first teach in the local synagogue. Here he would find Jewish worshippers and devout gentiles seeking to learn more about the God of Israel. It was in the synagogue that Paul began to teach in Athens. <font color= "blue">"Therefore he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and with the Gentile worshippers, and in the marketplace daily with those who happened to be there.” (Acts 17:17)</font>. The marketplace, called the Agora, was in the old town centre. It was the forum and hub of public life.</p>
<h3>
Paul faces the philosophers
</h3>
<p>
As Paul preached the word of God in this public place, he was confronted by Epicurean and Stoic philosophers. They asked <font color= "blue">"What does this babbler want to say?" Others said, "He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign gods," because he preached to them Jesus and the resurrection.” (Acts 17:18)</font>.</p>
<p>
These brilliant and educated Athenians didn’t understand the simple, though profound truth of God. Their intellectualism must have impressed Paul deeply. Later, he would write to the nearby Corinthian church,<font color= "blue"> “The message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing”... The “Jews request a sign, and Greeks seek after wisdom” (1 Cor 1:18,22)</font>.</p>
<p>
Paul wasn’t interested in human philosophy, however. <font color= "blue">“We preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block and to the Greeks foolishness, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God” (1 Cor 1:23-24)</font>.</p>
<p>
It’s not surprising that the Epicureans and Stoics did not comprehend the gospel of Christ. The Epicureans believed the gods didn’t exist or weren’t involved with human affairs. To them, Paul’s God and Saviour was just another foreign deity. The Stoics believed in reason as the principle by which humans should live. They relied on rational abilities and self-sufficiency. There was little place for a personal God in their thinking.</p>
<h3>
Questioned by the council
</h3>
<p>
Paul’s preaching about repentance, the resurrection and salvation, as well as God’s judgement, must have seemed strange. In fact, it caused such a stir that the intelligentsia of Athens took him before the town council, the Areopagus, to explain himself.</p>
<p>
The Athenian Areopagus was responsible for morals, culture, education and religion. The council also evaluated the competence of visiting lecturers to speak. To teach in their city, one needed the council’s official approval. The court met on the 377-foot hill called the Areopagus, or the Hill of the Greek god Ares (the Roman god Mars).</p>
<p>
Imagine perhaps 30 council members, with power to decide whether Paul could teach about Christ. Before these noted thinkers and sophisticated philosophers stood the former rabbi, ready to explain the faith of Jesus Christ. The members of the Areopagus asked Paul, <font color= "blue">“May we know what this new doctrine is of which you speak? For you are bringing some strange things to our ears. Therefore we want to know what these things mean” (Acts 17:19-20)</font>.</p>
<p>
How would Paul make the message of salvation seem sensible to these unbelievers? Paul didn’t begin his defence by referring to Jewish history or by quoting the Hebrew Scriptures. The Expositor’s Bible Commentary points out: “He knew it would be futile to refer to a history no one knew or argue from fulfilment of prophecy no one was interested in or quote from a book no one read or accepted as authoritative” (page 475).</p>
<h3>
Revealing the “Unknown God”
</h3>
<p>
Paul referred to something the council could identify with. In the city, he had seen an altar with the inscription “To the Unknown God.” He used the inscription as a launching platform for his message. Paul told them,<font color= "blue"> “Men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are very religious”; for as I was passing through and considering the objects of your worship,” he continued, “I even found an altar with this inscription: to the unknown god. Therefore, the One whom you worship without knowing, Him I proclaim to you” (Acts 17:22-23)</font>.</p>
<p>
As Paul further explained God’s purpose for humanity, he referred to what their own people of letters had said. <font color= "blue">“For in Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, "For we are also His offspring” (Acts 17:28)</font>.</p>
<h3>
Paul the Roman Citizen
</h3>
<p>
Paul used his Roman citizenship to protect himself from mobs and false arrest. He also used it as a means to preach the gospel. In Philippi, Paul and Silas had been beaten and imprisoned overnight by the Roman authorities. When morning came, the town magistrates sent officers to set Paul and Silas free. But Paul said to them: <font color= "blue">“They have beaten us openly, un-condemned Romans, and have thrown us into prison ... Let them come themselves and get us out”. And the officers told these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans.” (Acts 16:37-38)</font>.
Having violated the legal protection Roman citizenship afforded Paul, the magistrates came to free him and to apologize.</p>
<p>
According to The Expositor’s Bible Commentary: “A Roman citizen could travel anywhere within Roman territory under the protection of Rome. He was not subject to local legislation unless he consented...and he could appeal to be tried by Rome, not by local authorities, when in difficulty. As a citizen he owed allegiance directly to Rome, and Rome would protect him” (page 466).</p>
<p>
Paul on another occasion appealed to his Roman citizenship when the authorities wanted to beat him (Acts 22:25-29). He also appealed to have his case heard by Caesar’s judicial panel at Rome (Acts 25:10-11). The local Roman rulers, Festus and Agrippa, agreed (Acts 25:12; 26:32). Eventually, Paul arrived in Rome—the international capital of the world—and preached the gospel for two years because of this appeal (Acts 28:30-31).</p>
<p>
Paul preached the same message of conversion to the Athenian town council as he might have to you and me. He told these magistrates that humans <font color= "blue">“should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, hough He is not far from each one of us;” (Acts 17:27)</font>.</p>
<p>
Paul to the council, this God “... now commands all men everywhere to repent, because He has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man whom He has ordained” (Acts 17:30-31).</p>
<p>
The council members response was either polite disinterest or ridicule. Luke tells us when <font color= "blue">“they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked, while others said, "We will hear you again on this matter” (Acts 17:32)</font>.</p>
<p>
Yes, some council members were interested in hearing about Jesus. The Athenians loved to discuss philosophy and religion. Luke notes that <font color= "blue">“all the Athenians and the foreigners who were there spent their time in nothing else but either to tell or to hear some new thing” (Acts 17:21)</font>.</p>
<p>
However, God’s truth is not something we only talk about. It is something we put into practice. The knowledge of Christ demands action. This includes changing our lives.</p>
<p>
A few Athenians did respond to Paul’s preaching. Even one of the council members, Dionysius, was willing to act on Paul’s message. He believed the gospel, as did an influential woman, Damaris, and a few others (Acts 17:34).
Beyond these, almost no one was responding to God’s calling in this great intellectual and idolatrous city. Though a little spiritual fruit was borne, there is no further mention of the city in Scripture. As the Areopagus had not approved Paul’s right to teach, Paul had a choice. He could wait in Athens until the council decided yea or nay. Or he could move on to another city where his message might receive a better hearing.</p>
<h2 align="center">
With Paul in Corinth
</h2>
<h3>
Impression of the City
</h3>
<p>
Paul chose to leave Athens. His next destination was the commercial city of Corinth. As usual, Paul entered the synagogue every Sabbath where he testified that <font color= "blue">“Jesus is the Christ” (Acts 18:4-5)</font>.</p>
<p>
The Corinth of Paul’s day was a more prominent city than Athens. Because of its strategic location between the Greek mainland and the Peloponnesian peninsula, it was a prosperous city-state and commercial centre. Corinth's population was probably more than 200,000, or at least 20 times that of Athens. Today, the two cities have switched roles in size and vigour. Modern Athens is a huge city; Corinth is a small town with a population of about 20,000.</p>
<p>
Ancient Corinth was built on the north side of the Acrocorinth, an acropolis rising precipitously to almost 2,000 feet. The hill was home to a temple of Aphrodite, which stood on the highest point of the Acrocorinth. In the temple’s flourishing days it had a thousand priestesses of Aphrodite who were sacred prostitutes. In the evening these prostitutes came down to the city streets.</p>
<p>
Ancient Corinth was known as the Sin City of Greece. The Greeks had an expression, “to play the Corinthian.” It referred to people who lived a life of debauchery. This pleasure-mad life-style plagued many of the Corinthian believers even after conversion. They struggled to put their immoral life behind them. Because of their spiritual problems, Paul had to write a strong corrective letter to the Corinthians a few years after his visit.</p>
<p>
Paul’s words were to the point: <font color= "blue">“Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the kingdom of God.And such were some of you” (1 Cor 6:9-11)</font>.</p>
<h3>
A tale of two cities
</h3>
<p>
The Corinthian converts sometimes gave in to their fleshly weaknesses. However, they had committed themselves to a new way of life and showed faith in Christ. That is what’s so unusual about their response to Christ. We might imagine the worldly and morally corrupt Corinthians would show little interest in a Jewish carpenter, especially one who preached a hard-to-follow spiritual morality.</p>
<p>
On the other hand, the Athenians were interested in moral questions, in philosophy and in religion. We might have expected them to be more willing to listen to God’s truth. In this ironic tale of two different cities, the opposite proved true. Unlike the citizens of Athens, many Corinthians listened to Paul’s message, believed it and were baptised.</p>
<p>
The apostle Paul himself had not known what to make of the Corinthians unexpected interest in God’s message. While teaching in the city, Paul had a vision from God. A voice told him:<font color= "blue"> “Do not be afraid, but speak, and do not keep silent; for I am with you, and no one will attack you to hurt you; for I have many people in this city” (Acts 18:9-10)</font>.</p>
<p>
In this most worldly of cities, the spiritual harvest was so large that Paul taught at Corinth and ministered to the believers for 18 months (Acts 18:11). While a few influential people may have been converted in Corinth, most were average folks or the downtrodden.</p>
<p>
Paul would explain: “For you see your calling, brethren, that not many wise according to the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called. But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty; and the base things of the world and the things which are despised God has chosen, and the things which are not, to bring to nothing the things that are, that no flesh should glory in His presence.” (1 Cor 1:26-29).</p>
<h3>
Paul, Apostle to the Gentiles
</h3>
<p>
God chose an individual well suited to the task of proclaiming the gospel message and establishing churches in Europe.</p>
<p>
Paul campaigned mostly in major cities, selecting trading centres from which the message of Christ could be spread far and wide. Those cities—such as Thessalonica or Corinth—also had Jewish colonies and synagogues.
Paul employed a simple strategy in spreading the gospel of Jesus Christ in Greece, as he did everywhere he preached. He usually visited the local synagogue where Jews and devout gentiles gathered on the Sabbath day, and where the Holy Scriptures, the Christian Old Testament, were read (Acts 17:1-2).</p>
<p>
In the local synagogue, Paul, a former rabbinical teacher, could proclaim Jesus as the Messiah to all who gathered for worship services. For this reason the apostle’s work would usually not begin until the Sabbath, when he went to the Jewish meeting place.</p>
<p>
What was it Paul taught these Corinthians that so many changed their way of life so dramatically? It was <font color= "blue">“Jesus Christ and Him crucified” (1 Cor 2:2)</font>.</p>
<p>
That story of Christ crucified is as important to us as it was to the Jews, Greeks and Romans of the first century. The heart of this story’s message is that all humans have sinned.
We all need the atoning sacrifice of Jesus. It is only through Jesus Christ, said Paul (Acts 13:38), that we can have forgiveness and eternal life.
Paul told them that Jesus’ sacrifice should inspire human beings to make a lifelong commitment to God. Paul wrote that Christ <font color= "blue">“He died for all, that those who live should live no longer for themselves, but for Him who died for them and rose again” (2 Cor 5:15)</font>.</p>
<p>
Yes, Christ died, but he was also resurrected. That’s the good news story (1 Cor 15:1-4). Our salvation—the hope of our own resurrection —depends on Jesus’ resurrection (1 Cor 15:12-26).</p>
<>p
Paul’s message of salvation was much more than theology. He called on his hearers and readers to change the way they lived and viewed life. To bring their <font color= "blue">“every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ” (2 Cor 10:5)</font>. Paul preached then—and he does so to us through his writings—that we  <font color= "blue">“should repent, turn to God, and do works befitting repentance” (Acts 26:20)</font>.</p>
<p>
Paul said that through Christ’s earthly ministry and living presence we can experience the spiritual power of God in our lives. He wrote the Philippians from prison, saying, <font color= "blue">“I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me” (Phil 4:13)</font>. Through the power of God in us, we can belief in Christ as our Saviour. The result is our salvation—a gift from God.</p>
<p>
That is the message Paul took to the Greeks almost 2,000 years ago. That is the message we can read in Paul’s writings and in Luke’s account of Paul’s life. That is the message we announce—a message that can change our lives and give us hope for eternal life.</p>
