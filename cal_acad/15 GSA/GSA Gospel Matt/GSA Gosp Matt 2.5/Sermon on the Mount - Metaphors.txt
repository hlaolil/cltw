<h3>
Salt of the Earth
</h3>
<p>
Our Saviour Jesus Christ tells us <font color= "blue"> "You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavour, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men. You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. (Matt 5:13-14)</font></p> 
<p>
He says that we are the "salt of the earth" and the "light of the world"—we who are also the weak and the foolish of this world (1 Cor 1:27). Mentally, when we hear such praises from God, some of us look both ways and behind, and say, "He must be talking about someone else." We struggle to overcome these thoughts. Though we wish with all our heart that we were more like God, His image in us seems all the more elusive.</p>
<p>
But Jesus did not lie in saying these things. As salt gives food a rich, pleasant taste, we are those who are to give a good flavour to the lives of those we encounter. There should be something in our conduct that shows the fruit of the life to which God has called us.</p>
<p>
He goes on to say that, if we are not "radiating with flavour"—reflecting the teachings of God in our lives—what use are we, especially to God Himself? Salt without flavour has no use, and it can even be detrimental to the things it comes in contact with. Maybe its best use is to be put on icy roads, to be ground under the tyres of vehicles and then washed away.</p>
<h3>
Light to the World
</h3>
<p>
In Christ's other metaphor, light illuminates what was once dark; it reveals things that were hidden. Though we may be poor, considered old and over the hill, uneducated and obscure, when we live our lives as He instructs, we are a brilliant beacon to this tired and confused world. Our lives can shine a spotlight on the solutions to many common problems experienced by our friends and neighbours.</p>
<p>
Jesus points out <font color= "blue">Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lamp stand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. (Matt 5:15)</font>, but live it in the open for all to see. We can set a proper example of the abundant way to live. We should give everyone we meet the light of our loving concern, the light of our honesty, the light of joy and peace, the light of godly family relations, the light of good work habits, and all the other rays of light contained in God's way.</p>
<p>
In doing this, we will initially bring attention upon ourselves, and this may at times become uncomfortable. Righteousness has an uncanny tendency to bring out the worst in carnal human beings. Ultimately, however, we will glorify God the Father and His Son</p>
<p>
A Christian's righteous life, pleasant attitude, and good works, including pure conversation and faithful obedience, should not be hidden but be seen and known. We can give no light until we have received the grace of God and the enlightenment that comes through the Holy Spirit. Our lives must produce the fruit of the Spirit, reflecting the shining example of Jesus Christ. Humbly, in all communities, in all business, at home and abroad, in prosperity and adversity, it should be clear that we adhere to God's way of life. Letting our examples shine requires that we resist the influence of the world. We cannot have a light that shines and at the same time live as the world does with its lust of the flesh, lust of the eyes, and pride of life (1 John 2:16-17).</p>
