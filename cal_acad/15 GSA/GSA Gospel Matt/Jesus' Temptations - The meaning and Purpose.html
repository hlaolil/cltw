Jesus' Temptations - <br>The Meaning and Purpose
</h1>
<h3>
The Temptations
</h3>
<p>
The three temptations by Satan in the wilderness were not the only temptations our Lord ever suffered on Earth. We read in Luke 4:2 that He was tempted by the devil for forty days, but He was undoubtedly tempted at other times <br>(Luke 4:13; Matt 16:21–23; Luke 22:42), and yet in all this He was without sin or compromise. Although some have suggested that the Lord’s period of fasting compares with that of both Moses (Ex 34:28) and Elijah (1 Kings 19:8), the main point is how the Lord deals with temptation in the light of His humanity.</p>
<p>
It is because He is human, and made like us in every way, that He could do three vital things: </p>
<p>
1) destroy the devil’s power and free those who were held in slavery by their &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;fear of death (Heb 2:15);</p>
<p>
2) become a merciful and faithful High Priest in service to God and atone for our &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;sins (Heb 2:17); and </p>
<p>
3) be the One who is able to sympathise with us in all our weaknesses and &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;infirmities (Heb 4:15).</p> 
<p>
Our Lord’s human nature enables Him to sympathise with our own weaknesses, because He was subjected to weakness, too. More importantly, we have a High Priest who is able to intercede on our behalf and provide the grace of forgiveness.</p>
<p>
Temptation is never as great as when one has made a public declaration of faith as did our Lord when He was baptised in the Jordan (Matt 3:13–17). <br>However, we also note that, during this time of exhaustive testing, our Lord was also ministered to by angels, a mystery indeed that the omnipotent One should condescend to receive such help from lesser beings!<br> Here is a beautiful description of the ministry that His people also benefit from. During times of testing and trial, we too are aided by angels who are ministering spirits sent to those who will inherit salvation (Heb 1:14).</p>
<h3>
The Temptation Patterns
</h3>
<p>
Jesus’ temptations follow three patterns that are common to all men. </p>
<p>
The first temptation concerns the lust of the flesh (Matt 4:3–4). <br>Our Lord is hungry, and the devil tempts Him to convert stones into bread, but He replies with Scripture, quoting Deut 8:3. </p>
<p>
The second temptation concerns the pride of life (Matt 4:5–7), and here the devil uses a verse of Scripture (Psa 91:11–12), but the Lord replies again with Scripture to the contrary (Deut 6:16), stating that it is wrong for Him to abuse His own powers. </p>
<p>
The third temptation concerns the lust of the eyes (Matt 4:8–10), and if any quick route to the Messiahship could be attained, bypassing the passion and crucifixion for which He had originally come, this was the way. <br>The devil already had control over the kingdoms of the world (Eph 2:2) but was now ready to give everything to Christ in return for His allegiance. <br>But the mere thought almost causes the Lord’s divine nature to shudder at such a concept and He replies sharply,<font color= "blue"> “You shall fear the Lord your God and serve Him, and shall take oaths in His name.” (Deut 6:13)</font>.</p>
<p>
There are many temptations that we sadly fall into because our flesh is naturally weak, but we have a God who will not let us be tempted beyond what we can bear; He will provide a way out (1 Cor 10:13). We can therefore be victorious and then will thank the Lord for deliverance from temptation. <br>Jesus’ experience in the desert helps us to see these common temptations that keep us from serving God effectively. Furthermore, we learn from Jesus’ response to the temptations exactly how we are to respond—with Scripture. <br>The forces of evil come to us with a myriad of temptations, but all have the same three things at their core: lust of the eyes, lust of the flesh, and the pride of life. We can only recognise and combat these temptations by saturating our hearts and minds with the Truth.<br> The armour of a Christian solider in the spiritual battle of life includes only one offensive weapon, the sword of the Spirit which is the Word of God (Eph 6:17). Knowing the Bible intimately will put the Sword in our hands and enable us to be victorious over temptations.</p>
