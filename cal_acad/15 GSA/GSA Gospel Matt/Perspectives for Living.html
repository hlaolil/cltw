Perspectives for Living
</h1>
<h3>
Charity
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Take heed that you do not do your charitable deeds before men, to be seen by them. Otherwise you have no reward from your Father in heaven. Therefore, when you do a charitable deed, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may have glory from men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward. But when you do a charitable deed, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, that your charitable deed may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will Himself reward you openly.(Matt 6:1-4)</font></p>
<p>
Charity was one of the three pillars of Jewish piety. However, it can easily become a deceptive witness to what is going on in your heart. It can make it look like you want the praise of God, when in fact you are more interested in getting the praise of the community. Proclaiming charitable acts in public places promotes the donor in the eyes of people, therefore it will only ever get a human response.</p>
<p>
When God gives, it is usually unheralded and in secret. We don’t see the giving of gifts like fertility and plenty until we have received them, but by faith we can accept they are the gifts from God.  If you are seeking to please your Heavenly Father there is no need to trumpet your charity or announce it to men.<br> God gives the gift of life secretly, in the egg, the womb or the ground, be like Him and give life-giving charity secretly. If you have to ask a trusted aid (the person at your right hand) to  administer a gift, then don’t even tell another trusted aid (the person at your left hand). If your charity is given where only God can see, then its clear that you are intent on being like God and God will reward that publicly.</p>
<h3>
Prayer
</h3>
<p> <font color= "blue">
"And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward. But you, when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. And when you pray, do not use vain repetitions as the heathen do. For they think that they will be heard for their many words. Therefore do not be like them. For your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him. (Matt 6:5-8)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">
Pray in the inner room</font></p>
<p>
This passage starts by reiterating the message of Matt 6:1-4.<br> Piety performed for show is done for your own benefit and not for God’s.<br> Its reward comes in the form of fickle human adulation, which can catapult you to celebrity one day and vote you off the next. In some cultures it is normal to stop what you are doing and pray at certain times, it then becomes easy to fall into the trap of organising your day so that you are in a public place at those times. A person may easily gain a reputation for piety by attending all the prayer meetings, but without that habit of prayer ever spilling out into their everyday lives. Such folk gain the admiration of their peers, but often miss out on the greater prize of a living relationship with God.</p>
<p>
The inner room in the temple was where Judaism’s High Priest met with God. Nobody else was allowed in there. Each of us has a similar private place where we can meet with God. For many it will take the form of a special location, but it need be no more than a private place within your thoughts. <br>When you pray, withdraw there and shut out the world, the God who created you will still hear. Once you open the door and come back into your day-to-day existence, God will reward in public the time you spent alone with him.</p>
<p>
God already knows the needs of His creation and what is on your heart, so repetition does not help express your need. Many of the gentile cultures amidst which Jesus’ audience lived felt that by repeating prayers they could change the way their deity would act. Many still feel that way, hence the proliferation in some places of mechanical devices to promote repetition of prayer.<br> However, for Jesus, prayer was not about telling God what to do, but about asking Him to honour His word, obtaining wisdom about how that word applied to specific situations, seeking divine judgements, and honestly engaging with Him about our own attitudes and aspirations.</p>
<h3>
How should we pray?
</h3>
<p>
How should we pray? It is a question that many ask today, and it was a question that any first-century Jewish disciple might reasonably expect their Rabbi to answer. Thus, following His comments on hypocritical prayer, Jesus suggests how His followers should pray. He provides them with the prayer we now refer to as the Lord’s Prayer, a prayer for collective use by all who consider God their Heavenly Father (note how it uses ‘our’ and ‘us’).</p>
<p>
The Lord’s Prayer (Matt 6:9-13), distils the themes of the Sermon down into a succinct prayer. It opens with intercession for the coming of the Kingdom promised in the beatitudes. The centrality of God’s words finds its expression in asking for ‘daily bread’, i.e. for God given wisdom. Then the prayer seeks the sort of freedom from temptation and deliverance touched on by the antitheses corrective wisdom. </p>
<p>
Wrapped around the central focus, of seeking God’s wisdom and forgiveness, is the idea that just as what God thinks in heaven should affect what is done on earth, so what we think on earth affects what is done in heaven. <br>As Jesus points out in Matt 6:14-15, whether we forgive others governs whether God will forgive us or not. God has fashioned mankind to fulfil good purposes in accord with the divine will. However, all fall short of that high goal. <br>Therefore, what people need above all else is for God to forgive them when they have inadvertently gone astray, unknowingly fallen short, or deliberately sinned and then repented. If we refuse to forgive those around us, then God applies the same measure to us.</p>
<p>
We should pray, says Jesus, that God’s name be kept holy without the need to put us to the test, that God’s Kingdom will come and deliver us from evil.<br> Indeed this was the pressing matter of the moment, for Israel had already rejected Jesus authority once. Although God is merciful, allowing time for repentance, He is also just and eventually has to uphold His word.</p>
<h3>
Hypocritical Fasting
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Moreover, when you fast, do not be like the hypocrites, with a sad countenance. For they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men to be fasting. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward. But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, so that you do not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly.(Matt 6:16-18)</font></p>
<p>
Those who go out of your way to show men that they fast declare that they are earnestly seeking God. However, in practice they are earnestly seeking the good opinion of men. Such hypocritical actions portray a false witness to their relationship with God, implying that it is good, when it can’t be.</p>
<p>
If your resolve is known only to God then that demonstrates faith and faith is rewarded.</p>
<h3>
Laying up Treasure
</h3>
<p>
Jesus, has taught on the sixth, seventh, eighth and ninth commandments. <br>Now, turning to the tenth, He presents some extended teaching on personal attitudes to possessions.  
The context here is coveting other people’s possessions and the antidote to that is generosity.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. <br>(Matt 6:19-21)</font></p>
<p>
In Jesus’ day, treasure tended to take the form of fine clothing and metal objects. Being harder to produce than objects of wood and stone or agricultural produce they were of greater worth. Hence, gold and silver were precious, but even iron and fine cloth was very valuable.</p>
<p>
In that period houses were generally constructed with windows on the first floor to keep thieves out, but walls were often less substantial than modern bricks and mortar, so thieves would break through them.</p>
<p>
In Palestine, the fabric eating caterpillars of the moth Tineola bisselliella destroy fine clothing, whilst rust is the universal scourge of valuable iron tools.<br> Thieves are less discriminating and may take anything of value.<br> There is no treasure on earth so imperishable and so secure that it cannot succumb to the passage of time or be stolen away in some sudden disaster.</p> 
<p>
God’s presence ensures the absolute protection and preservation of heavenly treasure. However, such riches take a different form. Gold, silk and rubies are as worthless as common construction materials, for what God values above all else is character. </p>
<p>
We all focus on those things that are important to us, so if our treasure is in Heaven our interest will be in Heaven as well. Some Jewish teachers spoke specifically of generosity as a way of laying up treasure in heaven. <br>Certainly, as far as Heaven is concerned, generosity that reflects God’s nature out performs even the brightest of share portfolios.</p>
<p>
Talk of treasure, money, gifts, food and clothing is all clearly related to this theme. However, in some cases Jesus uses figures of speech (such as eyes and planks or pearls and swine) that need a bit of interpreting in order to see how they fit in with the overall theme.</p>
<h3>
Good and evil eyes
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is good, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness! (Matt 6:22-23)</font></p>
<p>
In the Hebrew culture the eye was not something that took in light and converted it into what we see. Rather, the eye was like a lamp, it gave out. <br>In English we preserve that sense when we speak about a person looking upon someone benevolently or about giving them the evil eye.</p>
<p>
This section’s general theme is covetousness (the tenth commandment), so a sound eye is a generous one that does not covet others abilities or possessions. By contrast, an evil eye is one that looks greedily upon others wealth and status, wishing it was their own.</p> 
<p>
Jesus argues that the way we look upon others will colour all our dealings with them. If the way we look upon them is sound, then we will be full of godly wisdom (light) in dealing with them. However, if we look upon them the wrong way, then the advice we will offer is useless to see by (darkness), i.e. it is of no benefit in helping them to find the way of blessing that God has set before them.</p> 
<h3>
God or Mammon
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other.<br> You cannot serve God and Mammon.(Matt 6:24)</font></p>
<p>
The English term Mammon comes from the Aramaic for riches, ‘mamon’, which encompassed possessions as well as money. </p>
<p>
Jesus has in mind more than just the conflict of interest that can occur when a person has two jobs. He was talking about the inability of a slave to belong to two masters at once. Jesus’ exaggerated language emphasises the extreme incompatibility between two attitudes, of serving God or serving stuff.</p>
<p>
Everyone serves some goal or another, even if it is only an easy life.<br>For many, their goal is greater material prosperity. They are willing to enslave themselves to lenders or careers in order to acquire and maintain their possessions. Furthermore, the increase in what they have often prompts a desire for yet more goods, in a vicious and soul-destroying cycle. <br>If your goal is solely wealth then you are going to hate serving God, because heaven’s treasure is less tangible.</p>
<p>
If you are trying to serve God, then wealth and possessions are as likely to be a hindrance as an aid. That is not to say that serving God cannot result in wealth, some famous servants of God (such as Joseph and Nehemiah) were incredibly wealthy by the standards of their time. However, their wealth and status were incidental to their service of God and they used them as tools to achieve their Lord’s ends.</p>
<h3>
Consider the birds
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Therefore I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink; nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing? Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? Which of you by worrying can add one cubit to his stature? (Matt 6:25-27)</font></p>
<p>
Jesus’ continues His teaching on the desire for possessions with some observations drawn from nature. He asks us to consider the “birds of the sky”, or as many translations put it “birds of the air.” On the surface this is a simple encouragement not to be anxious. However, it has a deeper message that concerns our attitudes to other people’s wealth.</p> 
<p>
It is easy to desire the glory that others have, the designer clothes, the good food and the fine wine that come with it. However, desiring life is more important than any of that. Not just your own life, but life for everyone, for what one person has, another cannot have.</p>
<p>
When the Hebrew Scriptures portray birds of the sky (birds of the air in many translations) feeding, they are consistently scavenging on the remains of the formerly glorious, but now deceased. Whether the departed is an individual or an entire nation, their pride and arrogance has been brought to naught by their overthrow and death. Smaller birds would feast on the deserted crops of those who perished in such a debacle, but more notable would be the scavenging birds. In the sky of first-century Israel soaring birds like eagles, buzzards, ravens and vultures, were more common then than they are today and would have been a familiar sight. A reminder of God’s provision that hung lazily, yet ominously, awaiting the feast provided whenever God judged a death in order, whether that be of an animal or an army. </p>
<p>
If, through the fall of the arrogant and proud, God fed despised scavengers, then surely He would also provide for His servants at such times. <br>Indeed, the passage calls to mind an incident where God used ravens to bring food to the prophet Elijah. That in itself was a reminder how, at times when apostate Israel came under judgement, God provided for His people in the wilderness or amongst the nations in which they sought refuge.</p> 
<h3>
A lesson from Solomon
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
So why do you worry about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin; and yet I say to you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. Now if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? (Matt 6:28-30)</font></p>
<p>
Solomon enjoyed one of the most glorious reigns in Israel’s history, yet his desire to acquire ever more led him into marriages of convenience with trading partners. These domestic arrangements proved to be the downfall of his kingdom, for they lured him into the worship of multiple gods. The fallout, from Solomon’s desire for wealth, split Israel and went on claiming lives for centuries. </p>
<p>
Solomon was famous for his interest in natural history, so Jesus places his reference to that great king amidst observations from nature, of the type that Solomon himself might have made in his wiser moments.</p>
<p>
Like the birds of the sky feeding on the fallen, the grass of the field being thrown into an oven was another familiar Biblical picture, again of how death renders all human glory transitory. Each year Israel’s countryside would have blossomed with the rains as ‘lilies of the field’ covered vast swathes, as they still do in some parts. However, come the baking heat of the dry season, their glory soon fades. The prophet Isaiah contrasted this picture with the eternal glory of God's wisdom that never fades.</p>
<p>
If God was capable of providing such finery for the transient blooms, surely those to whom God entrusts wisdom will be clothed even more gloriously.</p>
<h3>
God’s kingdom - An antidote to Anxiety
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Therefore do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own things. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble. (Matt 31-34)</font></p>
<p> 
Food, drink and clothing are basic requirements for life, but the context here is being covetous, so Jesus was speaking about the anxiety that results from wanting what other people have. Those around us might seem to have apparently secure lifestyles and all they need. But the child of God should not imitate those without faith, by coveting such things when they are in the hands of others. Their daily requirements are in the hands of their heavenly father to provide, so they need not worry that others seem to have things that they have not. For them, the emphasis should be on seeking God’s Kingdom, rather than getting anxious about what others have. When the Kingdom comes, so will the sort of security of provision they desire (such was the implication of the Beatitudes).</p>
<p>
Does this mean that one can just wait for God’s provision to turn up? <br>The biblical perspective is that God provides the ability for us to then meet our own needs. The exception being for those who are too busy doing the tasks that God has called them to. Their needs are generally met, at God’s instruction, by the people whom they serve. Only once these normal channels fail, is there likely to be direct divine provision, and then usually mediated by an act of faith.</p>
<p>
When famine struck the family of Jacob, God had already arranged provision for them elsewhere. Then, during Israel’s Exodus through the wilderness, God manipulated apparently natural agencies to provide food for his people, feeding them with manna and quail. He later did the same for Elijah, who was fed by ravens. Such stories can sometimes seem like pure invention, until you come across the accounts of similar provision that are found in many Christian biographies, e.g. those of George Muller and Yongi Cho. It can be hard to credit the gospel accounts of Jesus’ feeding of the five thousand, but not if you are amongst those who have experienced such events first hand, e.g. in Mexico or Mozambique.</p>
<p>
The key to unlocking divine resources is to focus on what the kingdom of God requires, yet every day people will fail to meet those demands and so they need Him to forgive this evil. However, just as during the Exodus, where God only concerns Himself with providing food for His people’s immediate needs. <br>So it is sufficient to deal with today’s evil (i.e the issues you already know about), without worrying about what unanticipated evil tomorrow might reveal. God offers forgiveness of past and present evils to those who repent, but not for evil yet to be committed. Instead, He stands ready to dispense forgiveness daily to those who acknowledge their need.</p>
<h3>
Judged as you Judge
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
 "Judge not, that you be not judged. For with what judgement you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you.<br> And why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye, but do not consider the plank in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, 'Let me remove the speck from your eye'; and look, a plank is in your own eye? Hypocrite!<br> First remove the plank from your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye. (Matt 7:1-5)</font></p>
<p>
Here Jesus’ context is still the tenth commandment. In Hebrew culture, the eye was a thing that gave out, casting a soul’s light upon others for their benefit or withholding it to their detriment. The exercise of generosity was therefore intimately linked with looking benevolently upon others.</p>
<p>
The figurative obstructions of speck and bean (or plank) both stood in the way of the eyes proper function. Both limited the amount that it could give out. Hence, Jesus cautions against judging other’s generosity as meagre, when we have yet to appreciate the full extent of our own lack of generosity.</p>
<p>
This verse is often taken as applying to judgement in general.<br> Such a generalisation is quite appropriate and may even have been Jesus’ original intention, for what is true for an individual’s generosity is true for the light from the lamp of their soul as well. That light is the godly wisdom that is characteristic of a good leader. If a leader could not see better than those they aim to lead, then what use was the blind leading the partially-sighted.<br> The one who wants to judge others should therefore judge themselves first.</p>
<p>
Jesus’ accusation of hypocrisy appears indirectly aimed at the Pharisees, whom He accused of paying undue attention to the small details of giving, such as tithing mint and cumin, whilst ignoring bigger issues, such as giving John the Baptist and his followers the honour that they were due.</p>
<h3>
Giving Holy things to dogs
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Do not give what is holy to the dogs; nor cast your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn and tear you in pieces. (Matt 7:6)</font></p>
<p> 
As Jesus continues His teaching on ‘do not covet,’ once again generosity is central. He has encouraged a generosity of spirit that is only possible in the assurance that God cares for you. However, He now introduces a note of caution. Holy things were precious, as were pearls, so they needed to be given wisely.</p>
<p>
The Romans loved pearls and would use them to adorn their furniture and temple goods. Romans loved to wear pearls on their clothes and even on their footwear and its laces, around 77 C.E. the latter practice caused the first-century encyclopeadist Pliny the Elder to exclaimed “It is not enough to wear pearls, but they must tread upon them, and walk with them under foot as well” (Plin Nat 9:56). The Romans, it seems, certainly knew how to trample a pearl in the mud in a gratuitous show of ostentatiousness.</p>
<p>
Judaism considered both dogs and pigs indiscriminate feeders whose diet, behaviour and other characteristics made them unfit to present to God as an offering. Amongst followers of Judaism, it was therefore common to refer to those outside their faith, whose attitude to the Law they considered similarly indiscriminate, as dogs or pigs. Therefore, Jesus’ saying should probably be read along the following lines - <br>
“Beware of lavishing precious gifts on indiscriminate scavengers, not only might they ignore the value of what you offer them, but they may see you as nothing more than a source of sustenance and ruin you in the process.”</p> 
<h3>
Knock and it will be opened</p>
</h3>
<p>
Knocking was used within Judaism as a description of prayer and it was unusual for such a bold promise of an answer to be given. It may be that Jesus intended to convey, as many have suggested, that a generous God wants to grant our wishes if we would but tell Him what they are. However, it is worth noting that this passage follows two that concern the application of wisdom in relation to giving. </p>
<p>
Here, as in the Lord’s prayer, the context involves asking for food but the sustenance serves as a symbol for the wisdom to ensure it. God can, and still does, produce meals miraculously, however more often than not He gives us the wisdom to obtain it for ourselves instead. Seek and you will find the bread of heaven, knock and you will feast on its meat.</p>
<p>
Bread and fish were the most basic of foodstuffs around lake Galilee. <br>However, to a young child, stones and loaves can look superficially similar <br>(both round and brown), as can snakes and fish (both have scales).<br> It takes a father’s wisdom (or a mother’s) to recognise one from another and keep the child safe.</p>
<p>
Compared to the unadulterated goodness of God, any fathers amongst Jesus’ audience were evil (even though by our standards they might have seemed good). Yet, they had the wisdom to discriminate between what was good for their children and what was bad. If they have the wisdom to ensure that their children only got good gifts, then how much more would that be the case for their Heavenly Father, the wisest of the wise. Hence, Jesus could be confident, not that God would provide His children’s every whim, but that when they asked, the portion that He gave them, whatever that might be, would be intended for their good rather than their harm.</p>
<h3>
The Golden Rule
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Therefore, whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets. (Matt 7:12)</font></p>
<p>
It was common for a Rabbi to end a block of teaching with a pithy summary of the lesson. In this verse Jesus provides just such a summary. Having concluded His teaching on the commandments, Jesus then provides us with advice on moving forward. The way to life is hard to find and therefore our sources of ‘spiritual’ advice need careful checking.  In the long run, Jesus teaching will be worthless unless we act on it, for our actions are only of any permanent value when they are founded upon His teaching. </p>
<p>
In Matt 5:17-18, Jesus stressed that He was not trying to do away with the wisdom of the Law and the prophets, but to fulfil them. This verse’s summation of the Law and prophets is the golden rule upon which all others rules concerning inter-personal behaviour rest.</p> 
<p>
The idea that one should not do anything to others that you would not want them to do to you was widely accepted. After all, few of us would desire our family to be treated unjustly, with hatred and intolerance. Most would settle for their family being treated fairly, with politeness and toleration.<br> However, for Jesus, God’s commandments were as much about actively doing as passively refraining. God instructs His servants to treat humanity precisely the way He wants His ‘family’ to be treated, with justice, mercy and love. <br>In that respect, He always intended mankind to follow His lead.</p>
<h3>
Choose your gate
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and there are many who go in by it. Because narrow is the gate and difficult is the way which leads to life, and there are few who find it. <br>(Matt 7:13-14)</font></p>
<p>
The concept that we can live two ways, one leading to life and one to death, was widely recognised in Judaism. Most people appreciated that you had to choose between the two, but assumed that, provided they did nothing bad, they were on the path to life. Jesus stood that general expectation on its head.</p>
<p>
Death comes easily, just do nothing and you will quickly discover how soon its minions overtake you. Poverty will come upon you like a thief, bringing along its companions famine and sickness. By contrast, you have to work at finding life. The way to do so, Jesus suggested, did not involve simply taking the easy options (the wide gate), nor just following the crowd (the broad way).<br> Walking the restricted way involves seeking out God’s will for every circumstance and being prepared to go through the narrow gate of difficult decisions to make it happen.</p>
<p>
People are easily put off from finding the way that leads to life by the effort involved. Yet whatever pursuing life costs, in the end that has to be better than the alternative of destruction.</p> 
<h3>
Prophets in sheep’s clothing
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes from thorn bushes or figs from thistles? Even so, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Therefore by their fruits you will know them. (Matt 7:15-20)</font></p>
<p>
Israel had a tradition of prophets wearing hairy garb and of thinking of its spiritual leaders as shepherds. A sheepskin was therefore an appropriate garment for a prophetic leader. However, simply because someone has the badge of office does not guarantee they will be good for your soul.</p>
<p>
The scriptures consider people to be like trees and their achievements like fruit. A prophetic leader should be judged by the outcome of their activities.<br> Are their lives a wilderness where you scratch a meagre living amidst their prickles, or are they fertile places in which you find both grapes of joy and figs of penitence to satisfy your soul.</p> 
<p>
In Matt 7:20, Jesus is drawing upon Moses’ instructions for besieging a city. <br>In times of war, the attacker built wooden siege engines, which the defenders then attempted to burn. Vast amounts of wood were consumed, so Moses instructed that during such a siege every good fruit tree was to be left. <br>Only the bad trees were to be cut down. </p>
<h3>
Doing the Father’s Will
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven. Many will say to Me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?' And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!' <br>(Matt 7:21-23)</font></p>
<p>
In Jesus’ culture, the doubling up of a word served to emphasise it.<br>However, no matter how emphatic you are about Jesus’ being lord of your life, what matters is whether you do what Jesus’ Heavenly Father wants done. <br>When it comes to satisfying God, lip-service is simply not good enough.</p>
<p>
You can emphatically claim Jesus is your Lord and exercise all manner of spiritual gifts using his authority, but if this is done without honouring God’s opinions then it counts for nothing. Those who don't first seek God’s way of righteousness or who fail to love their neighbour as themselves, will find that all their unerringly accurate predictions, miraculous healings, and startling exorcisms, for every one of which they have given Jesus the credit, will nevertheless be considered worse than useless.</p>
<h3>
A House to Withstanding the Flood
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Therefore whoever hears these sayings of Mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man who built his house on the rock: and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it did not fall, for it was founded on the rock. But everyone who hears these sayings of Mine, and does not do them, will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand: and the rain descended, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house; and it fell. And great was its fall." (Matt 7:24-27)</font></p>
<p>
This parable of the wise and foolish builders is a well known teaching, for at one level Jesus’ meaning is obvious. You build on a solid foundation if you want what you build to stand and obeying Jesus’ words provides just such a solid foundation. However, Jesus uses symbolic elements in this picture to give it a deeper and much richer meaning. The house, the wind and flood, and the rock are the symbols that He uses. </p>
<p>
Jesus’ forefather, David, was promised an enduring house, in other words a dynasty that would stand, come what may. </p>
<p>
The Hebrew Bible portrays floods and winds as forces that brought chaos and could only be controlled by God. It therefore uses them metaphorically to describe the causes of calamity that could suddenly overtake an individual <br>(e.g. Job 27:20), a nation or a dynasty. Especially those caused by the foreign armies that periodically swept across Palestine.</p> 
<p>
Moses describes God Himself as ‘The Rock’ (Deut 32:4), a metaphor that would ingrain itself in the Jewish national psyche. God was their sure place of refuge and strong tower against the enemy.</p>
<p>
Thus, the person who listens to Jesus and obeys Him is like someone building the enduring house of David, a house founded securely upon God and able to withstand the chaos and tumult that typically beset first century Palestine (and which we are still familiar with today).</p> 
<p>
It is easy to see why Jesus chose rock as His solid foundation, yet sand is made of the same stuff as rock. Rock’s strength comes from a matrix that binds the individual particles together and holds them securely in place. Building your understanding of the Hebrew Bible upon innumerable disassociated rules and proof-texts, is like building upon sand. However, as Jesus’ teaching binds those scriptures together in their proper relationship, so trusting it becomes like building upon rock.</p>
<h3>
Not like the scribes
</h3>
<p>
Jesus had gone up the mountain to teach His disciples, but then a crowd had evidently gathered, for Matthew’s Gospel concludes its account of the Sermon on the Mount by focusing on their reaction.</p>
<p>
There were plenty of other rabbis around who had devoted a lifetime to studying the scriptures, yet Jesus’ teaching struck the crowd as different. <br>He reminded them of the rewards for perseverance in loving God, He exposed God’s words as the bedrock they could trust, and then He unpacked its meaning, contrasting His understanding of the scriptures with traditional teaching. However, He did so as if He expected what He said to be acted on, i.e. as if He had the authority to make definitive rulings on the law. So here was a Rabbi who taught with an assured understanding of the law’s intent, and yet He was not simply reciting what the scriptures said or quoting the prevailing opinions of the scribes (the professional theologians of their day and the arbiters in matters of religious law). His message was radically different from theirs and this left the crowd astonished.</p>
<p>
Had the crowd recognised who Jesus was, they might have appreciated just how privileged they were. For they had been privy to the king of the Kingdom of Heaven, as He educated His servants in its legislation. It was like sitting in the corner of a room where the highest judge in the land was training his future judiciary. The experience should have left them to ponder one question above all others. If this man really had such authority, would they accept it in their own lives and return to the way of righteousness. </p>
