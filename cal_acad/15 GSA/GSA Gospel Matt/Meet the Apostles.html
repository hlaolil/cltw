Meet the Apostles
</h1>
<p>
We find the names of, and stories about, the 12 apostles in:<br> Matt 10:2-4, Mark 3:14-19, and Luke 6:13-16</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
And when it was day, He called His disciples to Himself; and from them He chose twelve whom He also named apostles: Simon, whom He also named Peter, and Andrew his brother; James and John; Philip and Bartholomew; Matthew and Thomas; James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon called the Zealot; Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot who also became a traitor. (Luke 6:13-16)</font></p>
<p>
Jesus Christ selected 12 men from among His early followers to become His closest disciples. After an intensive discipleship course and following His resurrection from the dead, the Lord fully commissioned the apostles <br>(Matt 28:16-2, Mark 16:15) to advance God's kingdom and carry the gospel message to the world.</p>
<p>
These men became the pioneering leaders of the New Testament church, but they were not without faults and shortcomings. Interestingly, not one of the chosen 12 disciples was a scholar or rabbi. They had no extraordinary skills. Neither religious, nor refined, they were ordinary people, just like you and me.</p>
<p>
But God chose them for a purpose—to fan the flames of the gospel that would spread across the face of the earth and continue to burn bright throughout the centuries to follow. He selected and used each of these regular men to carry out His exceptional plan.</p>
<p>
Take a few moments now to learn a lesson or two from the 12 apostles—men who helped ignite the light of truth that still dwells within our hearts today and calls us to come and follow Jesus Christ.<p>
<h3>
1.  Peter
</h3>
<p>
Without question, the Apostle Peter was a "duh"-ciple most of us can identify with. One minute he was walking on water by faith, and the next he was sinking in doubts. Impulsive and emotional, Peter is best known for denying Jesus when the pressure was on. Even so, as a disciple he was dearly loved by Christ, holding a special place among the twelve.</p>
<p>
Peter, often a spokesman for the twelve, stands out in the Gospels.<br> Whenever the men are listed, Peter's name is first. He, James, and John formed the inner circle of Jesus' closest companions. These three alone were given the unique privilege of experiencing the transfiguration, along with a few other extraordinary revelations of Jesus.</p>
<p>
After the resurrection of Christ, Peter became a bold evangelist and missionary, and one of the greatest leaders of the early church. Passionate until the end, historians record that when Peter was sentenced to death by crucifixion, he requested that his head be turned toward the ground because he did not feel worthy to die in the same manner as his Saviour.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Life Lessons from Peter the Apostle</font></p>
<p>
When we forget that God is in control, we overstep our limited authority.<br> God works through us in spite of our human frailties. No offence is too great to be forgiven by God. We can accomplish great things when we put our faith in God instead of ourselves.
<h3> 
2.  Andrew
</h3>
<p>
The Apostle Andrew abandoned John the Baptist to become the first follower of Jesus of Nazareth, but John didn't mind. He knew his mission was to point people to the Messiah.</p>
<p>
Like many of us, Andrew lived in the shadow of his more famous sibling, Simon Peter. Andrew led Peter to Christ, then stepped into the background as his boisterous brother became a leader among the apostles and in the early church.</p>
<p>
The Gospels don't tell us a great deal about Andrew, but we can read between the lines and find a person who thirsted for truth and found it in the living water of Jesus Christ. Andrew brought people to Jesus. After Pentecost, Andrew became a missionary like the other apostles and preached the gospel.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Life Lessons from the Apostle Andrew</font></p>
<p>
Jesus truly is the Saviour of the world. When we find Jesus, we find the answers we have been looking for. The Apostle Andrew made Jesus the most important thing in his life, and we should too.</p>
<h3>
3.  James
</h3>
<p>
James the son of Zebedee, often called James the Greater to distinguish him from the other apostle named James, was a member of Jesus Christ's inner circle, which included his brother, the Apostle John, and Peter. Not only did James and John earn a special nickname from the Lord—"sons of thunder"—they were privileged to be at the front and centre of three supernatural events in the life of Christ. In addition to these honours, James' zeal for Jesus resulted in his being the first of the 12 apostles to be martyred. He was killed with the sword on order of King Herod Agrippa 1 of Judea, about 44 A.D., in a general persecution of the early church.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Life Lessons from the Apostle James</font></p>
<p>
Following Jesus Christ can lead to hardship and persecution, but the reward is eternal life with him in heaven.</p>
<h3>
4.  John
</h3>
<p>
The Apostle John, brother to James, was nicknamed by Jesus one of the "sons of thunder," but he liked to call himself "the disciple whom Jesus loved."<br> With his fiery temperament and special devotion to the Saviour, he gained a favoured place in Christ's inner circle.</p>
<p>
John's enormous impact on the early Christian church and his larger-than-life personality, make him a fascinating character study. His writings reveal contrasting traits. For instance, on the first Easter morning, with his typical zeal and enthusiasm, John raced Peter to the tomb after Mary Magdalene reported that it was now empty. Although John won the race and bragged about this achievement in his Gospel (John 20:1-9), he humbly allowed Peter to enter the tomb first.</p>
<p>
John was one of the first disciples chosen. He was an elder in the early church and helped spread the gospel message. He is credited with writing the Gospel of John; the letters 1 John, 2 John, and 3 John; and the book of Revelation.</p>
<p>
According to tradition, John outlived all of the disciples, dying of old age in Ephesus, where he preached a gospel of love and taught against heresy. </p>
<p><font size="+1">
Life Lessons from John the Apostle</font></p>
<p>
Christ is the Saviour who offers every person eternal life. If we follow Jesus, we are assured of forgiveness and salvation. As Christ loves us, we are to love others. God is love , and we, as Christians, are to be channels of God's love to our neighbours.</p>
<h3>
5.  Philip
</h3>
<p>
Jesus issued a personal call to Philip: <font color= "blue">"Follow me." (John 1:43)</font>. Leaving his old life behind, Philip answered the call. He may have been among the disciples with Jesus at the wedding feast in Cana, when Christ performed his first miracle, turning water into wine.</p>
<p>
Philip was one of the first followers of Jesus Christ, and he wasted no time calling others, like Nathanael, to do the same. Although little is known about him after the ascension of Christ, Bible historians believe Philip preached the gospel in Phrygia, in Asia Minor, and died a martyr there at Hierapolis.  </p>
<p><font size="+1">
Life Lessons from Philip the Apostle</font></p>
<p>
Starting with John the Baptist, Philip sought the path to salvation, which led him to Jesus Christ. Eternal life in Christ is available to anyone who desires it.</p>
<h3>
6.  Nathanael or Bartholomew
</h3>
<p>
Nathanael, believed to be the disciple Bartholomew, experienced a jarring first encounter with Jesus. When the Apostle Philip called him to come and meet the Messiah, Nathanael was sceptical, but he followed along anyway.<br> As Philip introduced him to Jesus, the Lord declared:<br> <font color= "blue">"Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!" Nathanael said to Him, "How do You know me?" Jesus answered and said to him, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you." Nathanael answered and said to Him, "Rabbi, You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!" <br>(John 1:47-49)</font></p>
<p>
Nathanael garnered only a few lines in the Gospels, nevertheless, in that instant he became a loyal follower of Jesus Christ. </p>
<p><font size="+1">
Life Lessons from Nathanael</font></p>
<p>
Our personal prejudices can skew our judgement. By being open to God's word, we come to know the truth.
<h3>
7.  Matthew
</h3>
<p>
Levi, who became the Apostle Matthew, was a customs official in Capernaum who taxed imports and exports based on his own judgement. The Jews hated him because he worked for Rome and betrayed his countrymen.</p>
<p>
But when Matthew the dishonest tax collector heard two words from Jesus, "Follow me," he left everything and obeyed. Like us, he longed to be accepted and loved. Matthew recognised Jesus as someone worth sacrificing for. <br>On the same day Jesus invited Matthew to follow him, Matthew threw a great farewell feast in his home in Capernaum, inviting his friends so they could meet Jesus too. From that time on, instead of collecting tax money, Matthew collected souls for Christ</p>
<p>
Despite his sinful past, Matthew was uniquely qualified to be a disciple.<br> He was an accurate record keeper and keen observer of people. He captured the smallest details. Those traits served him well when he wrote the Gospel of Matthew some 20 years later.</p>
<p>
By surface appearances, it was scandalous and offensive for Jesus to pick a tax collector as one of his closest followers, since they were widely hated by the Jews. Yet of the four Gospel writers, Matthew presented Jesus to the Jews as their hoped-for Messiah, tailoring his account to answer their questions.</p>
<p>
Matthew displayed one of the most radically changed lives in the Bible in response to an invitation from Jesus. He did not hesitate, he did not look back. He left behind a life of wealth and security for poverty and uncertainty. He abandoned the pleasures of this world for the promise of eternal life.</p>
<p>
The remainder of Matthew's life is uncertain. Tradition says he preached for 15 years in Jerusalem following the death and resurrection of Jesus, then went out on the mission field to other countries. Legend has it that he died as a martyr in the cause of Christ. </p>
<p><font size="+1">
Life Lessons from the Apostle Matthew</font></p>
<p>
God can use anyone to help him in his work. We should not feel unqualified because of our appearance, lack of education, or our past. Jesus looks for sincere commitment. We should also remember that the highest calling in life is serving God , no matter what the world says. Money, fame, and power cannot compare with being a follower of Jesus Christ
<h3>
8.  Thomas
</h3>
<p>
The Apostle Thomas is often referred to as "Doubting Thomas" because he refused to believe that Jesus had risen from the dead until he saw and touched Christ's physical wounds. As far as disciples go, however, history has dealt Thomas a bad rep. After all, each of the 12 apostles, except John, abandoned Jesus during his trial and death at Calvary.</p>
<p>
Thomas, like us, was prone to extremes. Earlier he had demonstrated courageous faith, willing to risk his own life to follow Jesus into Judea. <br>There is an important lesson to be gained from studying Thomas: <br>If we're truly seeking to know the truth, and we're honest with ourselves and others about our struggles and doubts, God will faithfully meet us and reveal Himself to us, just as He did for Thomas.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Life Lessons from the Apostle Thomas</font></p>
<p>
All of the disciples, except John, deserted Jesus at the cross. They misunderstood and doubted Jesus, but the Apostle Thomas is singled out in the gospels because he put his doubt into words.</p> 
<h3>
9.  James the Less
</h3>
<p>
James the Less is one of the most obscure apostles in the Bible. <br>The only things we know for certain are his name and that he was present in the upper room of Jerusalem after Christ ascended to heaven. <br>Although his accomplishments remain unknown to us today, James may simply have been overshadowed by the more prominent apostles. <br>Even so, being named among the twelve was no small achievement.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Life Lessons from Apostle James the Less</font></p>
<p>
While James the Less is one of the least known of the 12, we can't overlook the fact that each of these men sacrificed everything to follow the Lord. <br>Their spokesman Peter said,<font color= "blue"> "See, we have left all and followed You." <br>(Luke 18:28)</font></p>
<p>
They gave up family, friends, homes, jobs, and all things familiar to answer Christ's call.
These ordinary men who did extraordinary things for God, set the example for us. They formed the foundation of the Christian church, initiating a movement that steadily spread across the face of the earth. <br>And we are part of that movement--the body of Christ--today.</p>
<p>
For all we know, "Little James" was an unsung hero of faith. Evidently, he did not seek recognition or fame, for he received no glory or credit for his service to Christ. Perhaps the nugget of truth we can take from the altogether obscure life of James is reflected in this Psalm:<br>
<font color= "blue">
Not to us, O Lord, not to us, but to Your name give glory ... (Psa 115:1)</font></p>
<h3>
10.  Simon the Zealot
</h3>
<p>
Who doesn't like a good mystery? Well, the Scriptures introduce us to quite a few riddles that scholars have yet to solve. One of those puzzling questions is the exact identity of Simon the Zealot, the Bible's own mystery apostle.</p>
<p>
Scripture tells us almost nothing about Simon. In the Gospels, he is mentioned in three places, but only to list his name. In Acts 1:13 we learn that he was present with the apostles in the upper room of Jerusalem after Christ had ascended to heaven. Beyond those few details, we can only speculate about Simon and his designation as a Zealot.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Life Lessons from Apostle Simon the Zealot</font></p>
<p>
Jesus Christ transcends political causes, governments, and all earthly turmoil. His kingdom is eternal. Following Jesus leads to salvation and heaven .
</p>
<h3>
11.  Thaddeus or Jude
</h3>
<p>
Listed together with Simon the Zealot and James the Less, the Apostle Thaddeus completes a grouping of the least known disciples. Thaddeus, also known as Jude, is characterised as a tender-hearted, gentle man who displayed childlike humility.</p>
<p>
Scholars believe Thaddeus wrote the book of Jude. It's a short epistle, but the closing two verses contain a beautiful doxology, one of the finest expressions of praise to God in the entire New Testament. </p>
<p>
Church tradition holds that Thaddeus founded a church at Edessa and was crucified there as a martyr.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Life Lessons from Apostle Thaddeus or Jude</font></p>
<p>
In his short epistle, Jude warns believers to avoid false teachers who twist the gospel for their own purposes, and he calls us to staunchly defend the Christian faith during persecution.</p>
<h3>
12.  Judas Iscariot
</h3>
<p>
Judas Iscariot is the apostle who betrayed his Master with a kiss.<br>For this supreme act of treachery, some would say Judas Iscariot made the greatest error in history.</p>
<p> 
Down through time, people have had strong or mixed feelings about Judas. Some experience a sense of hatred toward him, others feel pity, and some have even considered him a hero. No matter how you react to him, one thing is certain,
believers can benefit greatly by taking a serious look at his life.</p>
<p>
Judas Iscariot is remembered for one thing: his betrayal of Jesus Christ.<br> Even though Judas showed remorse later, his name became a symbol for traitors and turncoats throughout history. His motive seemed to be greed, but some scholars speculate political desires lurked beneath his treachery.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Judas Iscariot's Accomplishments</font></p>
<p>
One of Jesus' original 12 disciples, Judas Iscariot travelled with Jesus and studied under him for three years. He apparently went with the other 11 when Jesus sent them to preach the gospel, cast out demons and heal the sick.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Judas Iscariot's Strengths:</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Then Judas, His betrayer, seeing that He had been condemned, was remorseful and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders, <br>(Matt 27:3)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">
Judas Iscariot's Weaknesses:</font></p>
<p>
Judas was a thief. He was in charge of the group's money bag and sometimes stole from it. He was disloyal. Even though the other apostles deserted Jesus and Peter denied him, Judas went so far as to lead the temple guard to Jesus at Gethsemane, and then identified Jesus by kissing him.</p>
<p>
It's natural for people to have strong or mixed feelings about Judas. <br>Some feel a sense of hatred toward him for his act of betrayal, others feel pity, and some throughout history have considered him a hero. No matter how you react to him, here are a few biblical facts about Judas Iscariot to keep in mind:</p>
<p>
He made a conscience choice to betray Jesus - Luke 22:48.</p>
<p>
He was a thief with greed in his heart - John 12:6.</p>
<p>
Jesus knew Judas' heart was set on evil and that he would not repent - <br>John 6:70, John 17:12.</p>
<p>
Judas' act of betrayal was part of God's sovereign plan - <br>Psa 41:9, Zech 11:12-13, Matt 20:18 and 26:20-25, Acts 1:16,20.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Life Lessons from the Apostle Judas</font></p>
<p>
An outward show of loyalty to Jesus is meaningless unless we also follow Christ in our heart. Satan and the world will try to get us to betray Jesus, so we must ask the Holy Spirit for help in resisting them.</p>
<p>
Although Judas attempted to undo the harm he had done, he failed to seek the Lord's forgiveness. Thinking it was too late for him, Judas ended his life in suicide.</p>
<p>
As long as we are alive and have breath, it's never too late to come to God for forgiveness and cleansing from sin. Sadly, Judas, who had been given the opportunity to walk in close fellowship with Jesus, completely missed the most important message of Christ's ministry.</p>
<p>
Believers can benefit from thinking about Judas Iscariot's life and considering their own commitment to the Lord. Are we true followers of Christ or secret pretenders? And if we fail, do we give up all hope, or do we accept His forgiveness and seek restoration?</p>
