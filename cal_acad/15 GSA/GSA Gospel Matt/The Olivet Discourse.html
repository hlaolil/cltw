   <h1>
The Olivet Discourse
</h1>
<p>
The Olivet Discourse is the name given to the orderly and extended teaching given by Jesus Christ on the Mount of Olives. His subject is the end times. <br>This discourse is recorded in Matt 24:1 – 25:46. Parallel passages are found in Mark 13:1-37 and Luke 21:5-36. The record in Matthew is the most extensive, so reference here will be to Matthew's Gospel.</p>
<p>
It is important to recognise that Jesus’ teaching in this discourse is in reference to Israel and not the Church. Christ was speaking of God’s future program for Israel. Other passages to consider when studying the Olivet Discourse are <br>Dan 9:24-27 and Rev 6:1–19:21, which refer to the future seven-year period called the tribulation. </p>
<p>
God’s program for the Church concludes with the rapture, which is not taught in the Olivet Discourse. The rapture of the Church is found in:<br> John 14:1-4; 1 Cor 15:51-52; and 1 Thess 4:13-18.<br>

Jesus had spoken to the Pharisees concerning judgement. This can be seen in the "woe" statements in (Matt 23).</p>
<h3>
Jesus' Prophesy about the Temple
</h3>
<p> <font color= "blue">
Then Jesus went out and departed from the temple, and His disciples came up to show Him the buildings of the temple. And Jesus said to them, "Do you not see all these things? Assuredly, I say to you, not one stone shall be left here upon another, that shall not be thrown down.” (Matt 24:1-2)</font>.</p> 
<p>
This prophecy was literally fulfilled in A.D. 70 when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem. The temple was burned. The gold in the temple melted in the fire and ran down into the cracks between the stones. As people later searched for the gold, they toppled every stone from its place. This destruction of Jerusalem was but a foreshadowing of what is yet to come.</p>
<p>
Jesus’ prophecy of doom got the disciples curious, and probably more than a little concerned. When they were alone with Jesus on the Mount of Olives, they asked Him, <font color= "blue">"Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?" (Matt 24:3)</font>.</p>
<h3>
The Tribulation
</h3>
<p>
What follows in Matt 24–25 refers to the future, seven-year tribulation period and the second coming of Christ at the end of the tribulation. During that time, God will complete His chastisement and purification of Israel and judge the whole world (Dan 9:24-27; Rev 6–19)</font>.</p>
<p>
Dan 9:27 indicates that the tribulation will be divided into two equal parts.</p>
<p> 
Jesus’ teaching in Matt 24:4-8 refers to the first half.</p>
<p> 
The “birth pangs” (Matt 24:8) refer to the sufferings that Israel will experience during the first 3 1/2 years.</p> 
<p>
The signs with reference to the end of the age are the coming of false messiahs (Matt 24:5),</p>
<p> 
the threat of wars and widespread conflict and various natural catastrophes (Matt 24:6-7),</p>
<p>
Rev 6 is a parallel passage. The apostle John writes of the seal judgements. </p>
<p>
Rev 6:2 speaks of a rider on a white horse, which refers to a false messiah called elsewhere the Antichrist and the Beast.</p>
<p>   
Rev 6:4 says that peace is taken from the earth.</p>
<p> 
Rev 6:6-8 speaks of famine and death. </p>
<p>
Jesus said these things are only the “beginning of birth pangs” (Matt 24:8). Worse is yet to come.</p>
<p>
In Rev 13, the second half of the tribulation begins when the Beast, or Antichrist, sets up his rule for 42 months (cf. Dan 9:27; Matt 24:15).</p>
<p>
The second half of the tribulation is described in Matt 24:9-14.</p>
<p> 
Persecution of the Jews and death (Matt 24:9) will be the result of the Beast’s rise to power. </p>
<p>
The Antichrist will also persecute anyone who refuses to follow him <br>(Rev 13:1-18).</p>
<p>
The salvation promised in Matt 24:13 is deliverance from the Beast’s persecution. The one who endures until Christ returns will be saved from the Beast.</p>
<p> 
Jesus says that “this gospel of the kingdom” will be preached worldwide before the end comes. In other words, the good news (gospel) will be available during the tribulation; the message will be that Christ will soon return in judgement to set up His earthly kingdom (Rev 20:4-6). This message will cause many people to realise their sinful state and receive the Saviour during the tribulation.</p>
<p>
Matt 24:15-26 gives further details concerning the tribulation.</p> 
<p>
Jesus refers to an “abomination” and desolation of a future temple in <br>Matt 24:15-22; this is more clearly spoken of in Luke 21:20-24.</p>
<p> 
The Beast will take authority and set up an image of himself in the future temple (Dan 9:27; 2 Thess 2:1-4; Rev 13:1-18). When this happens, Jesus says, head for the hills.</p> 
<p>
Those in Jerusalem are advised to flee for their lives when they see that Beast has taken his seat of authority (Matt 24:16-20).</p>
<p> 
The Antichrist will rule from Jerusalem for 42 months (3 1/2 years), the latter half of the tribulation, called the “great tribulation” in Matt 24:21.</p>
<p>
Jesus warns that the great tribulation will be the worst time ever seen on earth (Matt 24:21). 
<p>
In fact, if those days were not cut short by the return of Christ, no one would survive (compare the bowl judgements in Rev 16).</p>
<p>
Jesus again gives a warning of false prophets in the last days (Matt 24:23-28).</p>
<p> 
At the end of the tribulation, there will be astronomical upheaval (Matt 24:29), </p>
<p>
And the nations of the world will see the Christ “coming on the clouds of the sky, with power and great glory” (Matt 24:29-30).</p> 
<p>
Those who were saved during the tribulation will be gathered out of the world by the angels (Matt 24:31).</p>
<p>
Jesus emphasises the facts that there will be signs leading up to the day of judgement (Matt 24:32-34) and</p>
<p> 
that His Word is sure (Matt 24:35).</p>
<p> 
Jesus says that no one knows the timing of these events and that those upon whom judgement is coming will be caught unawares (Matt 24:36-44).</p>
<h3>
The Last Parables
</h3>
<p>
Jesus ends the Olivet Discourse with four parables.</p>
<p> 
The first one concerns a wicked servant whose master punishes him upon his return home (Matt 24:45-51).</p>
<p> 
The next, the Parable of the Ten Virgins, encourages readiness and watchfulness (Matt 25:1-13). </p>
<p>
The third parable, relating the story of three servants and their use (or misuse) of finances, teaches faithfulness in view of the fact that God’s servants must give an account of themselves one day (Matt 25:14-30). </p>
<p>
Jesus ends His discourse by telling the Parable of the Sheep and Goats, which pictures the dividing of the saved from the unsaved at the end of the tribulation before the commencement of Christ’s millennial reign (Matt 25:31-46).</p>
<p>
Within days of the Olivet Discourse, Jesus was betrayed into the hands of unbelievers and crucified for sinners. The Holy One of God will one day return in glory to judge the world, but first He had to provide the way of salvation for all who would trust in Him.</p>
