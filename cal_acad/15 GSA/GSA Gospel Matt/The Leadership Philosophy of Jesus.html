   <h1>
The Leadership Philosophy of Jesus
</h1>
<h3>
Jesus Was a Servant
</h3>
<p>
Jesus was the supreme example of His own philosophy of ministry. <br>In the 

incarnation, He voluntarily set aside the independent exercise of some of His 

divine prerogatives, took the form of a bond-servant, and humbled Himself through 

obedience–even to the point of dying on the cross (Phil 2:7-9).<br> His whole life was 

dedicated to fulfilling His Father’s will on behalf of others. That’s the heart 

and soul of a true spiritual leader.</p>
<p>
Jesus repeatedly used the slave/master metaphor to teach servant-leadership to His 

disciples. He dramatises humility, which is its primary characteristic:<br>
<font color= "blue">So when He had washed their feet, taken His garments, and sat 

down again, He said to them, "Do you know what I have done to you? You call me 

Teacher and Lord, and you say well, for so I am. If I then, your Lord and Teacher, 

have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. For I have given 

you an example, that you should do as I have done to you. Most assuredly, I say to 

you, a servant is not greater than his master; nor is he who is sent greater than 

he who sent him. If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them.” (John 

13:12-17)</font></p>
<h3>
Jesus Condemns Yearning for Honour Among Men
</h3>
<p>
Jesus condemns the prideful and self-seeking Jewish religious leaders, then uses 

the opportunity to stress the nature of true leadership:<br>
<font color= "blue">"The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat. Therefore 

whatever they tell you to observe, that observe and do, but do not do according to 

their works; for they say, and do not do. For they bind heavy burdens, hard to 

bear, and lay them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move them with 

one of their fingers But all their works they do to be seen by men. They make 

their phylacteries broad and enlarge the borders of their garments. They love the 

best places at feasts, the best seats in the synagogues, greetings in the 

marketplaces, and to be called by men, 'Rabbi, Rabbi.' But you, do not be called 

'Rabbi'; for One is your Teacher, the Christ, and you are all brethren. Do not 

call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven. And 

do not be called teachers; for One is your Teacher, the Christ. But he who is 

greatest among you shall be your servant. And whoever exalts himself will be 

humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted. (Matt 23:1-12)</font></p>
<p>
Over against the vice of pomposity, so characteristic of many a Pharisee or 

scribe, Jesus commends the virtue of humility and condemns the yearning for rank, 

for special recognition above one’s fellow members. The warning was necessary. 

Many a Jew must have envied the man who was called “rabbi” (loosely translated, 

“teacher”); or, if a member of the Sanhedrin was addressed as “father” (Acts 7:2) 

So Jesus is saying that the attention of His followers must not be fixed on human 

titles and distinctions but on God in Christ, worthy of all reverence, praise, and 

honour. To yearn for distinctions and honours above one’s fellow men, and 

unrelated to the glory that is due to Christ. <br>This is what He,Jesus,condemns
Jesus also confronted His own disciples for their sinful ambitions. In fact, much 

of His teaching on servant-leadership was prompted by their disputes over which of 

them would be greatest in God’s Kingdom.</p>
<h3>
Jesus Confronts His Disciples
</h3>

Their attitude</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Then the mother of Zebedee's sons came to Him with her sons, kneeling down and 

asking something from Him. And He said to her, "What do you wish?" She said to 

Him, "Grant that these two sons of mine may sit, one on Your right hand and the 

other on the left, in Your kingdom".. And hearing this, the ten became indignant 

with the two brothers (Matt 20:20-21,24).</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">
Christ’s response</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Yet it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you, 

let him be your servant. And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be 

your slave--just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to 

give His life a ransom for many. <br>(Matt 20:26-28; see also Mark 10:43-

45)</font>.</p>

The disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of 

heaven?” (Matt 18:1)</font>.</p>

"Assuredly, I say to you, unless you are converted and become as little children, 

you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven. Therefore whoever humbles 

himself as this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven.<br> (Matt 18:3

-4)</font>.</p>

<p><font color= "blue">
Then He came to Capernaum. And when He was in the house He asked them, "What was 

it you disputed among yourselves on the road?" But they kept silent, for on the 

road they had disputed among themselves who would be the greatest. (Mark 9:33-

34)</font>.</p>

Then a dispute arose among them as to which of them would be greatest. ... there 

was also a dispute among them, as to which of them should be considered the 

greatest. (Luke 9:46; 22:24)</font>.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Christ’s response</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
he who is least among you all will be great. (Luke 9:48)</font>.<br>
We see that a servant-leader must shun pride and selfishness and embrace humility 

and self-sacrifice.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"But Jesus called them to Himself and said, "You know that the rulers of the 

Gentiles lord it over them, and those who are great exercise authority over them. 

Yet it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you, 

let him be your servant. And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be 

your slave--just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to 

give His life a ransom for many." (Matt 20:25-28)</font></p>
<h3>
A Different Type of Leadership
</h3>
<p>
Now if this doesn’t flip what the world thinks of leadership on its head I don’t 

know what will. If we are to live a life in reflection to that of Christ, then 

this is what it will have to look like. The first must be last. We basically have 

to aim to out serve one another to be a good “leader” in God’s sight. What does 

this really look like? It's sacrificial and its yielding to the Spirit so that His 

fruit is shown towards those we serve (Gal 5:22-23).</p> 
<p>
Its like what Peter says:<br><font color= "blue">
"Shepherd the flock of God which is among you, serving as overseers, not by 

compulsion but willingly, not for dishonest gain but eagerly; nor as being lords 

over those entrusted to you, but being examples to the flock; and when the Chief 

Shepherd appears, you will receive the crown of glory that does not fade away. 

Likewise you younger people, submit yourselves to your elders. Yes, all of you be 

submissive to one another, and be clothed with humility, for "God resists the 

proud, But gives grace to the humble." (1 Peter 5:2-5)</font></p>
<p>
I was speechless when I was really able to digest this teaching. "The first will 

be last." "God did not come to serve but to be served." I said this to myself over 

and over. It made me hard-delete everything that I may have grown up thinking were 

the perks of leadership. How silly are the teachings of a fallen world.</p> 
<p>
One of the biggest things was the need to frame everything we do in the lens of 

the Great Commission (Matt 28:18-20). If these were truly our marching orders for 

life, then why wouldn’t we filter everything through this? If we are truly going 

to be good leaders to those we serve, we must disciple and teach them to follow 

His commandments. Unfortunately this sometimes does not happen.<br> Even in churches 

we fail to meet this call.</p>
<p>
The greatest and only true leader to come to this earth came to serve, make 

disciples, and teach them how to keep His commandments. He did this not by just 

meeting with them on Sunday’s and then getting back to business as usual. His 

entire life and daily activity revolved around serving, discipling, and teaching 

them His ways.</p>
