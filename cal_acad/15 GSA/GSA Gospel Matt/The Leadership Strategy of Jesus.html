   <h1>
The Leadership Strategy of Jesus
</h1>
<h3>
Introduction
</h3>
<p>
So much of the activity I see among leaders today is focused on reaching the masses. “Successful leaders” speak at big conferences, host popular television or radio shows, publish best selling books, or write successful blogs.<br> Their goal is breadth. They want to extend their influence to as many people as possible.</p>
<p>
Jesus had a much different leadership strategy. His goal was not “reach” or popularity. In fact, as strange as it sounds today, He actively discouraged publicity. On more than one occasion, after performing a jaw-dropping miracle, He told those who witnessed it, “Tell no one what you have seen”<br> (see e.g., Matt 8:4; 16:20; 17:9; Mark 7:36; 8:30; 9:9; Luke 5:14; and 8:56). He was a publicist’s nightmare.</p>
<h3>
Teaching
</h3>
<p>
Instead, Jesus focused on true depth and long-term impact.<br> To achieve this, He had a four-pronged leadership strategy:<br>
He taught the multitudes. Yes, Jesus had a public ministry and He occasionally spoke to thousands. However, He didn’t pander to these groups or “tickle their ears.” He confronted the status quo, jarred His listeners sensibilities, and often taught in parables. He didn’t feel the need to clarify everything. He often left His audience confused and wondering what He meant. His goal was apparently to shift their paradigm and get them to think.</p>
<h3>
Mobilising
</h3>
<p>
He mobilised the seventy. Jesus had a smaller, more intimate group to whom He gave specific assignments. He sent them out two-by-two. He asked for a big commitment. He gave them virtually no resources. Yet he demanded that they perform miracles. He told them to expect opposition (see Luke 10:1–12) and promised no earthly reward (see Luke 10:18–20).</p>
<h3>
Training 
</h3>
<p>
He trained the twelve. He chose the twelve disciples to be “with him” <br>(see Mark 3:14a) <br>He taught them and also gave them assignments (see Mark 3:14b–19). However, He also shared with them His daily life. <br>Like the Apostle Paul would do years later, He poured into them His very life (see 1 Thess 2:8). Because of this, He entrusted them with power to do the work He Himself had done. In fact, He promised them that they would actually do greater works (see John 14:12–14).</p>
<h3>
Inner Circle
</h3>
<p>
He confided in the three. Jesus had an inner circle comprised of Peter, James, and John.<br> He took them on special outings (see Matt 17:1).<br> He allowed them to witness His greatest glory (see Mark 9:2–3) and<br> His deepest temptation (see Mark 14:33–34).<br> He prayed with them (see Luke 9:28f).<br> He taught them things He did not teach the others <br>(see Matt 17:2; Mark 5:37–43).<br> He even introduced them to His heavenly family (see Matt 17:3).<br> They were His closest friends and confidants.</p>
<p>
Jesus’ leadership strategy evidently worked well. Within a generation, His followers turned the world upside down (see Acts 17:6). Within seven generations (318 A.D.), the emperor Constantine accepted His message and made Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire. <br>And here I am, almost two millennia later, writing about it.</p>
<p>
After interacting with leaders at every level for more than three decades, my observation is that most leaders only focus on the first two strategies.<br> They have a public teaching ministry, and they are good at mobilising groups for specific assignments. However, very few intentionally train a small group of disciples. Even fewer build deep relationships with a handful of confidants.<br>As a result, they do not have the kind of lasting impact they could have.</p>
<p>
The older I get, the more value I see in going deeper with a few. <br>Leading the masses may feed my ego, but it won’t guarantee an impact that will outlive me.</p>
