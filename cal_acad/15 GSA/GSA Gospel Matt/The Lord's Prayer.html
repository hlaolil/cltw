The Lord's Prayer
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Then He said to them, "My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death.<br> Stay here and watch with Me." He went a little farther and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, "O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You will.” ... Again, a second time, He went away and prayed, saying, "O My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from Me unless I drink it, Your will be done." (Matt 26:38-39,42)</font></p>
<p>
Jesus endured the wrath of God for us. All of it, entirely poured out on Him. <br>This isn’t a light thing. Read through this description in Isaiah:<br> <font color= "blue">“Behold, the name of the Lord comes from afar, Burning with His anger, And His burden is heavy; His lips are full of indignation, And His tongue like a devouring fire. His breath is like an overflowing stream, Which reaches up to the neck,<br> To sift the nations with the sieve of futility; And there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people, Causing them to err. ... The Lord will cause His glorious voice to be heard, And show the descent of His arm, With the indignation of His anger And the flame of a devouring fire, With scattering, tempest, and hailstones. ... For Tophet was established of old, Yes, for the king it is prepared. He has made it deep and large; Its pyre is fire with much wood; The breath of the Lord, like a stream of brimstone, Kindles it. (Isa 30:27-28,30,33)</font>.</p> 
<p>
The breath of the Lord kindles the fires of the wrath of God. This wrath is what we deserve for our countless offences against an infinitely holy and just God.<br> His justice has to be satisfied. He can’t simply overlook our sin.<br>
Jesus knew exactly what grace would cost. He knew the agony He would suffer. Scripture gives us a glimpse of the inner turmoil of Christ in the hours leading up to His sacrifice.<br> <font color= "blue">“My soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death” (Matt 26:38)</font>.</p>

<p><font color= "blue"> “And He said, "Abba, Father, all things are possible for You. Take this cup away from Me; nevertheless, not what I will, but what You will.” (Mark 14:36)</font>.</p> 
<p><font color= "blue">
“And being in agony, He prayed more earnestly. Then His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.” (Luke 22:44)</font>. </p>
<p>
People want options to get to heaven. They want to take their pick and find “what works” for them, for each of us. But they’re missing the point.<br> There was no other way. If there was some other road we could take to obtain forgiveness and grace, Jesus wouldn’t have gone through what He did.<br> He asked the Father that if there was any other way, if it was at all possible, to let the cup pass. Basically, “If there is any other option here, don’t let me go through this. But if this is the only way, I’ll do it.”</p>
<p>
The focus shouldn’t be “Why would God only make one way? How could He be so narrow-minded and leave us with so few options?” It should be praise to the magnificent glory of His grace—God made a way! Jesus endured all of this for us! It was absolutely impossible for us to know anything but the holy, righteous wrath of God and separation from Him forever. There was no way for us to pay our debt of sin, to escape the justice due to us. It’s amazing that we have a way at all. Someone came to rescue us. Someone took our punishment. <br>The only One who could. He did it. He came to save us to the uttermost. <br>And because Jesus did so, this is what we see at the end of the ages:</p>

“Then I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the scroll and to loose its seals?" And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll, or to look at it. So I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open and read the scroll, or to look at it. But one of the elders said to me, "Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the scroll and to loose its seven seals." And I looked, and behold, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as though it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent out into all the earth. Then He came and took the scroll out of the right hand of Him who sat on the throne. Now when He had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints. And they sang a new song, saying: "You are worthy to take the scroll, And to open its seals; For You were slain, And have redeemed us to God by Your blood Out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, And have made us kings and priests to our God; And we shall reign on the earth." Then I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands,  saying with a loud voice: "Worthy is the Lamb who was slain To receive power and riches and wisdom, And strength and honour and glory and blessing!" (Rev 5:2-12)</font></p>
<p>
Lord, You made a way for us. Impress the beauty and the power of this truth on the heart of each of us today, overwhelm us again with Your glorious grace.

“For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.” (John 3:16-17)</font></p>
<p>
May we stand in awe at how You love us, how You save us, and how You draw us to Yourself. Thank You for saving us to the uttermost, for choosing us and keeping us forever. Thank You for doing everything that needed to be done to ransom our souls. “It is finished.” In this we rejoice and find our hope, a steadfast anchor for our soul.</p>
