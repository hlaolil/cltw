Prophecy - The Olivet Discourse
</h1>
<p>
Matt 24 is a crucial passage for understanding the second coming of the Lord Jesus Christ; however, it is one of the most difficult in the whole of Scripture and has been an exegetical battleground with no absolute consensus even among those who take the Bible seriously as God’s Word.</p>
<p>
Matt 24 is in the context of the scathing denunciation of Matt 23, which ends with these words: <font color= "blue">"See! Your house is left to you desolate for I say to you, you shall see Me no more till you say, 'Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord!' " (Matt 23:38-39)</font>.</p>
<p>
Jesus’ words prompt His disciples to point out the beautiful <font color= "blue">buildings of the temple. And Jesus said to them, "Do you not see all these things? Assuredly, I say to you, not one stone shall be left here upon another, that shall not be thrown down." (Matt 24:1-2)</font></p>
<p>
This in turn leads His disciples to ask three questions (Matt 24:3):</p>
<p>
(1) “Tell us,” they said, “when will this happen,</p>
<p>
(2) and what will be the sign of your coming</p>
<p>
(3) and of the end of the age?”</p>
<p>
We must not ignore these three questions nor should we fuse them as if they were all one.</p>
<p>
Jesus begins to answer these three questions by laying out signposts of His kingdom, the kinds of things that point to the future judgement of God, but do not give us any clear or necessary indication of the time of that event.<br> Such things as the coming of false Christs, false prophets, wars and rumours of wars occur in every age. But there is an implication that such things will experience an intensification near the end: <br><font color= "blue">“All these are the beginning of sorrows.” (Matt 24:8)</font>. <br>Even so, they do not enable us absolutely to predict what will happen next and give us no instructions for a specific action to be taken.</p>
<p>
That all changes with what follows:<br>
<font color= "blue">"Therefore when you see the 'abomination of desolation,' spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place" (whoever reads, let him understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.” (Matt 24:15)</font></p>
<p> 
Here a specific sign is given that calls for specific action: the abomination of desolation that calls for Christians to flee from Jerusalem. Matthew and Mark both refer to this as the abomination of desolation, but add the words “let the reader understand.” Luke simply paraphrases our Lord’s words:<br><font color= "blue"> "But when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then know that its desolation is near.” (Luke 21:20)</font>. <br>In other words, this abomination of desolation refers to Jerusalem’s being surrounded by pagan armies. Jesus indicated that this would occur within the time frame of the generation of those with whom he spoke (Matt 23:36; 24:34).</p>
<p>
According to the defeated Jewish general, Josephus, who witnessed the city's destruction in A.D. 70, Jerusalem was surrounded by Roman armies in A.D. 66. These armies then inexplicably withdrew:<br>
It then happened that Cestius was not conscious either how the besieged despaired of success, nor, how courageous the people were for him; and so he recalled his soldiers from the place, and by despairing of any expectation of taking it, without having received any disgrace, he retired from the city, without any reason in the world.</p>
<h3>
Heeding the Warning 
</h3>
<p>
According to the historian of the Ancient Church, Eusebius, it was then that the believers remembered the warning of our Lord and fled the city:<br>

Moreover, the people of the church at Jerusalem, in accordance with a certain oracle that was vouchsafed by way of revelation to the approved men there, had been commanded to depart from the city before the war, and to inhabit a certain city of Peraea. They called it Pella. And when those who believed in Christ had removed from Jerusalem, as if holy men had utterly deserted both the royal metropolis of the Jews itself and the whole land of Judaea, the Justice of God then visited upon them all their acts of violence to Christ and His apostles, by destroying that generation of wicked persons root and branch from among men.</p>
<p>
This event, which was future for Jesus’ audience, is not future for us; it was fulfilled in real time and space over 1900 years ago. It is not the second coming of Christ, but is typologically related to it.</p>
<p>
What follows this appearance of the abomination of desolation may be described as the Jewish dark ages. Luke puts it this way:<br> <font color= "blue">“There will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people.<br> And they will fall by the edge of the sword and be led away captive into all nations. Jerusalem will be trampled on by the Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled” (Luke 21:23-24)</font>.<br> 
For over 1900 years this occurred. The Jewish people were exiled from their homeland and lived in fear of pogroms, with darkness and despair hanging over them.</p>
<h3>
Rapture
</h3>
<p>
Christians were able to escape the great tribulation that came on the Jews around A.D. 70.  But they had to take specific action and leave the city. <br>They were not to go back into their homes to rescue their earthly treasures: such action could have cost them their lives (Matt 24:17 ff.). <br> But such action is not necessary at the time of Christ’s second coming:<br>
<font color= "blue">
... so also will the coming of the Son of Man be. Then two men will be in the field: one will be taken and the other left. Two women will be grinding at the mill: one will be taken and the other left. (Matt 24:39-41)</font>.</p>
<p>
In the event of Matt 24:17 ff., the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, people could do something. In the event of Matt 24:36 ff., the action is done to them. They are raptured off the earth and caught up to be with the Lord. <br>Obviously, we are looking at two separate things, separate but similar, because they are both manifestations of divine intervention in mercy and judgement. The event in A.D. 70 is penultimate and has already taken place. The second coming of Christ is ultimate and still future for us.</p>
<p>
The most difficult section of the Olivet Discourse is found in Matt 24:30-35 -- what I will call the transition section, where our Lord shifts Himself from answering the disciples first question, about the destruction of the Temple, to His dealing with their second and third questions, His second coming and the end of the age. What precedes and what follows this section are both fairly clear: the first part referring to the destruction of the Jewish political and religious institutions and the second part referring to the return of Christ.</p>
<p>
Matt 24:30-35 is somewhat cloudy for several reasons:<br> Firstly, because it is a transition passage it deals both with what precedes and what follows.<br> 
Secondly, our Lord himself plainly tells us that not even He knew the time of His return, only the Father. 
<br>Thirdly, I believe our Lord deliberately keeps from a sharp delineation between the two events because of a theological truth, the kind of thing that one sometimes encounters in biblical typology: <br>
Jesus is the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world, but he was not incarnate in the form of Pascal lambs. The dramatic turn of events in A. D. 70, like the judgements on specific nations in the Old Testament, was a manifestation of the day of the Lord, but it did not exhaustively fulfil prophecy regarding the final day of the Lord which is still future for us.</p>
<p>
Their fusion in this way is a theological expression of truth: though separated in time, these two are inseparable in the sense that the first is the inevitable forerunner and prefiguration of the second. The destruction of Jerusalem marks the end of the Old Covenant — Christ has thus manifestly returned to inaugurate His kingly rule. Such a decisive intervention in the history of salvation will not occur again until the end of time when God will judge the whole human race ... No other intervention of God in history so involves the whole cosmos or prophesies its end as this one does, and the actual end of the world will be no more than the climax of all this.</p>
<p>
Let me digress on the second reason for a moment. The Lord Jesus Christ, who is both fully divine and fully human, in His human nature, was ignorant of certain things and specifically mentions the time of His second coming as one of those things. That means that in His perfect, yet finite human understanding, even if He thought that His second coming would be at a particular time, He did not know that with certainty.
One of the motifs in our song of hope is the imminence of the second coming of Christ. </p>
<p>
His coming was at hand for the believers living before A.D. 70; it was at hand for the Reformers; and it is at hand for us. <br>The Apostle Peter addresses this issue when he says,<br> <font color= "blue">“But, beloved, do not forget this one thing, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. 
The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is long suffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance. But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up.” (2 Peter 3:8-10)</font>.</p> 
<p>
God’s delay is rooted in His love for humankind: “not wanting anyone to perish, but everyone to come to repentance.” And from the perspective of eternity—God’s always, and one day ours—all the dreadful sufferings of this life are but, <font color= "blue">“our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,” (2 Cor 4:17)</font>.</p>
<p>
Imminence is not the only motif in our song of hope; we also have the intensifying fugue of a great world-wide revival sounded against the rise of dreadful evil, climaxing in the manifestation of the future man of sin. <br>This future man of sin has had his typological predecessors such as the first century Roman rulers, Caligula, Nero, and Domitian, and their second century B.C., Seleucid predecessor, Antiochus Epiphanes, who was opposed by the Maccabees.</p>
<p>
We must not allow any of these motifs to drown out the others, or we will become eschatologically imbalanced, thereby failing to challenge God’s people to live as they ought in this present world. Nor must we allow our human need to remove tensions and neatly box up our theology in a logically consistent box to press the doctrine of the imminence of Christ’s return to mean that He had to return in the life time of His first disciples.</p>
<p>
Having said that, let us now look specifically at our Lord’s words in Matt 24:<br>
<font color= "blue">
Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. (Matt 24:30-31)</font>.</p>
<p>
While I believe that this passage could be understood in light of apocalyptic genre of Christ’s agent, Titus, destroying Jewish civilization and the global spread of the gospel that followed in the succeeding centuries of Christianity (gathering His elect from the four winds), I think that it is more natural to read it as referring to Christ’s second coming, namely, that the next major event following the Jews being plunged into the darkness of their exile in unbelief would be our Lord’s (to us still future) return. The gathering of the elect, according to my understanding of the text, would be the rapture of the Church. This fits in well with what Paul teaches in 1 Thess 4:13 ff.</P>
<P>
The next verses are more difficult for the occidental mind:<br>

Now learn this lesson from the fig tree:<br> As soon as its twigs get tender and its leaves come out, you know that summer is near. Even so, when you see all these things, you know that it is near, right at the door (Matt 24:32, 33).

There are some irresolvable ambiguities in verses 32 through 35. For example, should the third person, singular, present, active, indicative form of the verb to be, be translated as “it is,” or “he is?” If, as I think, it is best translated as “it is,” then it is referring to the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70. On the other hand, grammatically speaking, it could just as easily be translated as “he is;” in which case it would refer to Christ’s second coming. 

In my understanding of the text, our Lord, whose style is not reflective of what we in the West assume is proper, contrasts these two events. Having mentioned his second coming, he now points his disciples once again to the destruction of Jerusalem. Unlike his second coming, which has no definite warning in terms of a specific, predictable time, the destruction of Jerusalem does. Hence “the lesson from the fig tree” from which the disciples were to learn and follow.

Taking Matt 24:32-33 to refer to the destruction of Jerusalem, the next two verses are very clear:

I tell you the truth, this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things have happened. Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will never pass away (Matt 24:34-35).</p>
<p>
Our Lord’s words were literally fulfilled. The Greek word translated “generation” may be translated by “race, kind,” but also refers to “the sum total of those born at the same time, expanded to include all those living at a given time and freq. defined in terms of specific characteristics, generation, contemporaries” [Danker, Frederick, Walter Bauer, W. F. Arndt and F. W. Gingrich, A Greek-English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2000), p. 191]. If it is translated by race or nation, then our Lord is saying that the Jewish people would never be fully destroyed. If it is translated by generation, in the sense of Jesus’ contemporaries, then the Lord is saying that some of the people who were listening to him would be alive when the Temple was destroyed, when “not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.”</p>
<p>
From Matt 24:36 to 25:46, the passage is relatively unambiguous and clearly refers to our Lord’s answer to the disciples questions regarding His second coming. Certain things stand out. The theme throughout the parables of this section is that, unlike the destruction of Jerusalem in A.D. 70, there will be no warning sign, which believers can observe and then act upon. The time of the second coming will be utterly unexpected:</p>
<p>
Matt 24:36 No one knows about that day or hour, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.</p>
<p>
Matt 24:39 ... they knew nothing about what would happen until the flood came and took them all away. That is how it will be at the coming of the Son of Man.</p>
<p>
Matt 24:42 Therefore keep watch, because you do not know on what day your Lord will come.</p>
<p>
Matt 24:44 So you also must be ready, because the Son of Man will come at an hour when you do not expect him.</p>
<p>
Matt 24:50 The master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he is not aware of.</p>
<p>
Matt 25:13 Therefore keep watch, because you do not know the day or the hour.</p>
<p>
Again, unlike the predicted destruction of Jerusalem within forty years (a generation, Matt 23:36; 24:34), the Lord Jesus teaches the possibility that His second coming may be much further off than we might imagine. This is obvious in three of His parables in the discourse, as is seen from the following verses:<br>

Matt 24:48 But suppose that servant is wicked and says to himself, "My master is staying away a long time."</p>
<p>
Matt 25:5 The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep.</p>
<p>
Matt 25:14,19 Again, it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted his property to them. After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.</p>
