  <h1>
Who was John The Baptist
</h1>
<p>
His name was divinely given. It was to be “John” (Luke 1:13), which derives from a Hebrew term signifying “Jehovah is gracious.”</p>
<p>
He was known familiarly as “the Baptist” (bearing no relation to the modern sect), which simply means “an immerser, one who administers the rite of immersion” (see Matt 3:1; 11:11; etc.). The Jewish historian Josephus even refers to John by this designation (Antiquities 18.5.2).</p>
<p>
The importance of John in the divine scheme of things probably is summed up best in the testimony of Jesus himself. <br><font color= "blue">“Among those born of women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist ...” (Matt 11:11)</font>.</p>
<h3>
John’s Background
</h3>
<p>
John was born to aged Jewish parents, Zacharias and Elizabeth, who were of a priestly family (Luke 1:5).<br> Interestingly, Elizabeth was related to Mary, the mother of Jesus (Luke 1:36). This devout couple lived in the “hill country” of Judea (Luke 1:39), perhaps Hebron, a priestly city of the region.<br>

Luke has a wonderful summary statement of the character of this Hebrew couple.<br><font color= "blue"> “And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless” (Luke 1:6)</font>.</p>
<p>
On the occasion of Zacharias’ exercise of his duty of burning incense in the temple at Jerusalem (a once-in-a-lifetime event for a priest), the angel Gabriel appeared to the elderly gentleman, informing him that his prayers had been heard, and that his wife would bear a son (Luke 1:13). One must necessarily infer that Zacharias had prayed for such in earlier times, though Elizabeth was barren, and both of them now were advanced in age (Luke 1:7).</p>
<p>
Clearly, John’s conception was miraculous; incidentally, he was about six months older than Jesus (Luke 1:26). It was foretold that this child would be filled with the Spirit of God, even from his mother’s womb, and that he would be reared under the strict code of the Nazirite (cf. Num. 6:1-21), an indication of the solemnity of his role in preparing the way for the world’s Redeemer.</p>
<p>
The Scriptures are silent as to the deaths of John’s parents – though legend has it that Zacharias was slain by Herod the Great, forcing Elizabeth to flee with her babe into the wilderness area of Judea. <br>Luke does say of John: <font color= "blue">“So the child grew and became strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his manifestation to Israel.” (Luke 1:80)</font>. <br>This desert (or deserted) area stretches from Jerusalem and Bethlehem eastward some 20 miles down to the Jordan River and the Dead Sea; it is a barren region of rugged hills and valleys.</p>
<h3>
John in Prophecy
</h3>
<p>
Any Hebrew familiar with his Old Testament could have expected the ministry of John as a preliminary measure in the divine plan, paving the way for the appearance of the Messiah. Note the following.</p>
<p>
(1) Seven centuries before the birth of Jesus, the prophet Isaiah spoke of <br><font color= "blue">“The voice of one crying in the wilderness: "Prepare the way of the Lord; Make straight in the desert A highway for our God.” (Isa 40:3)</font>.</p>
<p>
While many commentators find in this prediction an immediate application to Judah’s return from the Babylonian captivity, the New Testament writers see in it an ultimate fulfilment in the preparatory work of John the Baptiser <br>(cf. Matt 3:3; Mark 1:2-3; Luke 3:4-6; John 1:23).</p>
<p>
As professor Webb has observed, with the coming of Jesus, these words “sprang to life again with deeper and fuller meaning.” He comments further: <br>“Although there was a partial return from exile in the years following 539 B.C., spiritually the exile continued until the Messiah came. Only he could solve the deep, underlying problem” </p>
<p>
John, therefore, was a key figure in the preparation of the Messiah’s work.</p>
<p>
(2) In the concluding book of the Old Testament, Malachi, on behalf of God, declared: <font color= "blue">“"Behold, I send My messenger, and he will prepare the way before Me. And the Lord, whom you seek, will suddenly come to His temple, even the Messenger of the covenant, in whom you delight. Behold, He is coming," Says the Lord of hosts.” (Mal 3:1)</font>.</p>
<p>
First, note the distinction between the “messenger” who prepares the way, and the “Messenger of the Covenant,” for whom the way is prepared.<br> The former is a reference to John, the latter is an allusion to Christ.</p>
<p>
Second, Malachi’s prophecy regarding the “messenger” is clearly parallel in principle to that of Isaiah (cited above), which, as we have shown, focused in the ministry of John.</p>
<p>
Third, the prophet later refers to this “messenger” as “Elijah the prophet” <br>(Mal 4:4-5).<br>In the New Testament we have the testimony of the angel Gabriel (Luke 1:16), and that of Christ Himself (Matt 11:12-15), that this “Elijah” to come was none other than John.</p>
<p>
Truly: <font color= "blue">“There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.” (John 1:6)</font>.</p>
<h3>
The Demeanour of John
</h3>
<p>
The description of John is brief and stark. He was arrayed in a “camel’s hair” garment, secured by a leather belt, and his diet was locusts and wild honey (Matt 3:4). The “hair” cloak might have been a rough fabric woven from camel’s hair, or a camel skin itself. The text is ambiguous. It was, however, quite reminiscent of the adornment of certain Old Testament prophets (Zech 13:4), particularly Elijah, who, as we have noted, foreshadowed John (cf. 2 Kings 1:8).</p>
<p>
His dietary fare was that generally consumed by the poorer elements of society. He stood in bold relief to the wealthy, indulgent Jews of his day; he was a veritable walking sermon!</p>
<p>
Too, John was somewhat reclusive. <br>Jesus once said: <font color= "blue">“John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a demon” (Matt 11:18)</font>. <br>“Eating and drinking” stood for socialising. The prophet was not a party-goer. His ascetic life-style appeared almost demonic, like those possessed of evil spirits who apparently frequented the desolate areas (cf. Mark 5:2-3). <br>He did not seek out the multitudes; rather, somehow, he attracted them.</p>
<p>
The citizenry of Jerusalem and all Judea went out to him as he moved about in the Jordan Valley (Matt 3:5; cf. 13; John 1:28; 3:23). The imperfect tense verb, rendered “went out” (Matt 3:5), suggests a stream of auditors gravitating to the rough prophet. His influence was phenomenal. Hundreds, if not thousands, were immersed by him. And his success was solely in the message he proclaimed.</p>
<p>
The multitudes said that he performed no “sign,” though they regarded his message concerning Christ as true (John 10:41). This passage appears to indicate that John did not perform demonstrative miracles, as Jesus and the apostles did (cf. Matt 10:1ff). It is certainly the case, however, that his message was from God, and thus infallibly true. The power of John’s preaching, together with the void in Israel’s hearts, was a winning combination.</p>
<h3>
John’s Mission
</h3>
<p>
John’s mission can be summed up by one word, “preparer.” It was his happy chore to prepare a people for the coming Messiah. Both Isaiah and Malachi had announced that he would “prepare” the way for the coming of “ The Lord of hosts” – a firm affirmation, incidentally, of the deity of Jesus.</p>
<p>
The angel Gabriel had informed Zacharias that his son <font color= "blue">will turn many of the children of Israel to the Lord their God. He will also go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."(Luke 1:16-17)</font>.</p>
<p>
Zacharias himself prophesied that John <font color= "blue">will be called the prophet of the Highest; For you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways,” (Luke 1:76)</font>.</p>
<p>
And an inspired writer asserts that John came from God in order to <br><font color= "blue">“bear witness of the Light,” (i.e., Christ) (John 1:7-8)</font>.</p>
<p>
The fact that the birth of Christianity was such a resounding phenomenon, impacting the ancient world tremendously, and echoing marvellously across the centuries, is, in some measure, a commentary on how well John accomplished his mission.</p>
<h3>
John’s Message
</h3>
<p>
In a consideration of the preaching of John the Immerser, at least three areas should be given attention:</p>
<p>
(a) John’s message concerning Jesus; </p>
<p>
(b) his emphasis upon the coming kingdom, and the demands of citizenship therein; and,</p>
<p>
(c) the warning of ultimate judgement.</p>
<p>
Let us briefly explore these matters.<br>

“Behold, the Lamb of God.”<br>
John provided excellent witness to the nature of Christ. As the prophet began to generate attention, certain Jews in Jerusalem dispatched to him a delegation of priests and Levites in order to ascertain his identity.</p>
<p>
John emphatically stated that he was not the promised Messiah, nor was he a literally reincarnated Elijah; rather, he was the fulfilment of Isaiah’s prophecy, the voice of preparation for the arrival of God in the flesh (John 1:19-23).</p>
<p>
The declaration of John that he was unworthy to either carry Jesus’ sandals or to unloose the thongs thereof (Matt 3:11; John 1:27) was stunning testimony indeed – with obvious implications. <br>John characterised the Lord as <font color= "blue">“the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!” (John 1:29)</font>.</p>
<p>
In these remarks, the Immerser:</p>
<p> 
(a) identifies Christ as the antitype of the Passover sacrifice; </p>
<p>
(b) asserts the vicarious nature of Jesus’ impending death; </p>
<p>
(c) affirms the universality of the Savior’s mission.</p>
<p>
Moreover, though John was chronologically older than Jesus, he declared <br><font color= "blue">"This was He of whom I said, He who comes after me is preferred before me, for He was before me." (John 1:15,30)</font>. The imperfect tense form stresses the eternality of the pre-incarnate Word (John 1:1), hence, the Lord’s divine essence.</p>
<p>
Since John was administering a baptism that was <font color= "blue">“for the  remission of sins.” (Mark 1:4)</font>, he was understandably hesitant to immerse Jesus when the Lord approached him with that request (Matt 3:14).<br> The inference is clear; Jesus was sinless, or to say it in another way, a lamb without spot or blemish (1 Peter 1:19). By implication, therefore, John acknowledged the perfection of Christ.</p>
<p>
Too, having heard the very voice of God himself, and having witnessed the descent of the Holy Spirit in the visible form of a dove at that baptismal scene, John faithfully bore witness that Jesus <font color= "blue">“is the Son of God” (John 1:34)</font>.</p>
<p>
Many have been puzzled by John’s statement that he “knew not” Jesus until the day he immersed the Lord in the Jordan (John 1:31,33). It has been suggested that these texts indicate either that John did not know Jesus at all, or that he did not know the Lord as “Messiah,” until the moment the Holy Spirit descended upon him when he came up from the water of baptism.</p>
<p>
I do not think either of these views is correct. Surely John must have known his mission relative to his kinsman since the earliest days of their lives. Moreover, the fact that he resisted immersing Jesus is a strong clue that he was aware of the uniqueness of the Saviour.</p>
<p>
The key, I think, is in the Greek expression “knew [<i>edein</i>] not.”<br> The verb signifies a “clear and purely mental perception, in contrast both to conjecture and to knowledge derived from others”. When the Spirit was manifested at this time, John “knew,” in a definitive way, not experienced heretofore, that Jesus was the Messiah. There was now a certainty, documented from a higher Source!</p>
<h3>
Repent, for the kingdom of Heaven is at hand
</h3>
<p>
John preached about the coming kingdom and the need to repent. <br>The Palestine in which the prophet’s ministry was launched was firmly in the grip of a grossly pagan force, the Roman empire.<br> 
Edersheim graphically describes the conditions of the time.<br>

“It has been rightly said, that the idea of conscience, as we understand it, was unknown to heathenism. Absolute right did not exist. Might was right. The social relations exhibited, if possible, even deeper corruption. The sanctity of marriage had ceased. Female dissipation and the general dissoluteness led at last to an almost entire cessation of marriage. Abortion, and the exposure and murder of newly-born children, were common and tolerated; unnatural vices, which even the greatest philosophers practised, if not advocated, attained proportions which defy description”.
Moral corruption had made deep inroads into Judaism as well. Read carefully the second chapter of the book of Romans. It was into this world that John came with his piercing message: “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand” (Matt 3:2; cf. Mark 1:4).</p>
<p>
John’s message of “repentance” entailed a deep consciousness of offence to God within the sinner’s heart, with a required reformation of life.<br> When he saw superficial Hebrews submitting to his immersion, void of any radical change of conduct, he rebuked them: <br><font color= "blue">"Brood of vipers, who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? <br>Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance” (Matt 3:7-8)</font>.<p>
<p>
“Fruit” is the outward expression of deep inner conviction. Without fruit there is no real repentance. Surely we can learn from this that repentance is much more than merely saying, “I’m sorry.” Associated with John’s demand for repentance, was an immersion in water.</p>
<p>
For the preceding fifteen centuries – since the inauguration of the Mosaic system – the “reign” of God had been focused in the Hebrew people. This was by divine design – in preparation for the arrival of Heaven’s Messiah (cf. Gal 3:24-25).</p>
<p>
Now, though, a new phase of the “kingdom of God,” i.e., His reign among men, was about to commence (cf. Matt 21:43).<br> It would be a regime of a different composition than that of the old theocracy <br>(a combined religious and political system). The kingdom of Christ was not to be a this-world oriented system (see John 18:36).</p>
<p>
When John proclaimed that the kingdom was “at hand,” what did he mean by the expression. The Greek term is <i>engus</i>. The word basically means “near,” when employed literally.<br>
It can be used figuratively in prophecy to denote the certainty of an event, from the perspective of time as God views things (cf. Deut 32:35; Zeph 1:7).<br> The subsequent context of the Gospel records reveals that literal proximity is indicated here.</p>
<p>
Jesus would later indicate that some of those in his audience would not die until they observed the kingdom arrive, accompanied by power (Mark 9:1). Eventually it becomes apparent that this was fulfilled on the day of Pentecost (cf. Acts 1:8; 2:4). John certainly knew nothing of the modern idea that the “kingdom” was postponed until the time of Jesus’ return to earth, as dispensational pre-millennialists now allege.</p>
