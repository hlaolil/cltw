<h1>
The Death of Jesus Christ
</h1>
<h3>
Why Did Jesus Have to Die?
</h3>
<p>
Jesus had an amazingly productive ministry, teaching and healing thousands. He attracted large crowds and had potential for much more. He could have healed thousands more by travelling to the Jews and Gentiles who lived in other areas.</p>
<p>
But Jesus allowed this work to come to a sudden end. He could have avoided arrest, but He chose to die instead of expanding His ministry. Although His teachings were important, He had come not just to teach, but also to die.</p>
<p>
The Old Testament tells us that God appeared as a human being on several occasions. If Jesus wanted only to heal and teach, He could have simply appeared. But He did more: He became a human. Why? So He could die. To understand Jesus, we need to understand His death. His death is part of the gospel message and something all Christians should know about.</p>
<h3>
Born to die
</h3>
<p>
Jesus said, <font color= "blue">
“just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.” (Matt 20:28)</font>. He came to give his life, to die, and his death would result in salvation for others. This was the reason he came to earth. His blood was poured out for others (Matt 26:28).</p>
<p>
Jesus warned His disciples that He would suffer and die, but they did not seem to believe it. <font color= "blue">“From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised the third day. Then Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, "Far be it from You, Lord; this shall not happen to You!" (Matt 16:21-22)</font>.</p>

Jesus knew that He must die, because the Scriptures said so. <font color= "blue">“And how is it written concerning the Son of Man, that He must suffer many things and be treated with contempt?” (Mark 9:12; 9:31; 10:33-34)</font>.<br> 
<font color= "blue">“And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself. ... "Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,” (Luke 24:27,46)</font>.</p>
<p>
It all happened according to God’s plan: Herod and Pilate did only what God had decided beforehand should happen: 
<p><font color= "blue">
to do whatever Your hand and Your purpose determined before to be done. (Acts 4:28)</font>.</p> 
<p>
In the Garden of Gethsemane, as Jesus knew that He would soon be crucified, Jesus asked His Father if there might be some other way, but there was none (Luke 22:42)</font>. His death was necessary for our salvation.</p>
<h3>
The Suffering Servant
</h3>
<p>
It was written in the Old Testament, Jesus had said. Where was it written? Isa 53 is one of the prophecies. Jesus quoted Isa 53:12 when He said:<font color= "blue"> “For I say to you that this which is written must still be accomplished in Me: And He was numbered with the transgressors. For the things concerning Me have an end."” (Luke 22:37)</font>.<br>  
Jesus, although without sin, was to be counted among sinners. Notice what else is written in Isa 53:
<p><font color= "blue">
Surely He has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows; but He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned, every one, to his own way; and the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all. ... for the transgressions of My people He was stricken. ... Because He had done no violence, ... Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise Him; He has put Him to grief. ... the Lord makes His life a guilt offering.... And the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all, and He bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors (Isa 53:4-12)</font>.</p>
<p>
Isaiah describes someone who suffers not for his own sins, but for the sins of others. And though this man would be <font color= "blue">“cut off from the land of the living” (Isa 53:8)</font>, that would not be the end of the story. <font color= "blue">“He shall see the labour of His soul, and be satisfied. By His knowledge My righteous Servant shall justify many,.... He shall see His seed, He shall prolong His days,” (Isa 53:11,Isa 53:10)</font>.</p>
<p>
What Isaiah wrote, Jesus fulfilled. He laid down His life for His sheep (John 10:15). In His death, He carried our sins and suffered for our transgressions; He was punished so that we might have peace with God. Through His suffering and death, our spiritual illness is healed; we are justified, accepted by God.<br>
These truths are developed in more detail in the New Testament.
<h3>
Dying an accursed death
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“his body shall not remain overnight on the tree, ... for he who is hanged is accursed of God.” (Deut 21:23)</font>. <br>Because of this verse, Jews considered any crucified person to be condemned by God. As Isaiah wrote, people would consider him “accursed by God.”</p>
<p>
The Jewish leaders probably thought that Jesus’ disciples would give up after their leader was killed. And it happened just as they hoped — the crucifixion shattered the disciples hopes. They were dejected and said, <font color= "blue">
“But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel.” (Luke 24:21)</font>. But their hopes were dramatically restored when Jesus appeared to them after His resurrection, and at Pentecost, the Holy Spirit filled them with new conviction to proclaim salvation in Jesus Christ. They had unshakable faith in the least likely hero: a crucified Messiah.</p>
<p>
Peter told the Jewish leaders, <font color= "blue">“The God of our fathers raised up Jesus whom you murdered by hanging on a tree.” (Acts 5:30)</font>. By using the word tree, Peter reminded the leaders about the curse involved in crucifixion. But the shame was not on Jesus, he said—it was on the people who crucified him. God had blessed Jesus because he did not deserve the curse he suffered. God had reversed the stigma.</p>
<p>
Paul referred to the same curse: <font color= "blue">“Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us (for it is written, "Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree"),” (Gal 3:13)</font><br> Jesus became a curse on our behalf so we could escape the curse of the law, which is death. He became something he was not, so that we could become something we were not. <font color= "blue">“For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.” (2 Cor 5:21)</font>.</p>
<p>
He became sin for us, so that we might be declared righteous through Him. Because He suffered what we deserved, He redeemed us from the curse of the law. “The punishment that brought us peace was upon Him.” Because He suffered death, we can enjoy peace with God.</p>
<h3>
Message of the cross
</h3>
<p>
The disciples never forgot the shameful way that Jesus died. Indeed, sometimes that was the focus of the message: <font color= "blue">“but we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block and to the Greeks foolishness,” (1 Cor 1:23)</font>.<br> Paul even called the gospel <font color= "blue">“the message of the cross” (1 Cor 1:18)</font>.<br> 
Paul reminded the Galatians that “before whose eyes Jesus Christ was clearly portrayed among you as crucified?” (Gal 3:1). That was how he summarised the way that he preached the gospel.</p>
<p>
Why is the cross good news? Because the cross is the means by which Jesus rescued us from death. Paul focused on the cross because it is the key to Jesus being good news for us. We will not be raised into glory unless in Christ we are made “the righteousness of God.” Only then can we join Jesus in His glory. The crucifixion is part of the process by which we are transformed from the old creation to the new.</p>
<p>
Paul says that Jesus died “for us” (Rom 5:6-8; 2 Cor 5:14; 1 Thess 5:10); he also says that He died “for our sins” (1 Cor 15:3; Gal 1:4). “He himself bore our sins in His body on the tree” (1 Peter 2:24; 3:18). Paul also says that we died with Christ (Rom 6:3-8). Though our union with Him in faith, we participate in His death.</p>
<p>
It is as if we were on the cross, receiving the curse that our sins deserved. But He did it for us, and because He did it, we can be justified, or proclaimed as righteous. He takes our sin and death; He gives us righteousness and life. The prince became a pauper, so that we paupers might become princes.</p>
<p>
Although Jesus used the word ransom to describe our rescue, the ransom wasn’t paid to anyone in particular—this is a figure of speech to indicate that it cost Jesus an enormous amount to set us free. In the same way, Paul talks about Jesus redeeming us, buying our freedom, but he didn’t pay anyone.</p>
<p>
God loves people—but He hates sin, because sin hurts people. God wants everyone to change (2 Peter 3:9), but those who don’t will suffer the result of their own sins.</p>
<p>
In the death of Jesus, our sins are set aside. But this does not mean that a loving Jesus appeased or “paid off” an angry God. The Father is just as merciful as Jesus is, and Jesus is just as angry about sin as the Father is. He is angry at sin because sin hurts the people He loves. Jesus is the Judge who condemns (Matt 25:31-46), as well as the Judge who loves sinners so much that He dies for them.</p>
<p>
When God forgives us, He does not simply wipe away sin and pretend it never existed. Sins have serious consequences—consequences we can see in the cross of Christ. Humanity's tendency to sin cost Jesus pain and shame and death.</p>
<p>
The gospel reveals that God acts righteously in forgiving us (Rom 1:17); His mercy is part of His righteous character. He does not ignore our sins, but takes care of them in Jesus Christ. Metaphorically, God presented Jesus as a sacrifice for our forgiveness. Sin has consequences, and Jesus volunteered to suffer the consequences on our behalf. The cross demonstrates God’s love as well as His justice (Rom 5:8).</p>
<p>
As Isaiah says, we have peace with God because of what Christ did. We were once enemies of God, but through Christ we have been brought near (Eph 2:13). In other words, we have been reconciled to God through the cross (Eph 2:16). It is a basic Christian belief that our relationship with God depends on Jesus Christ, including His death.</p>
<p>
Christianity is not a list of things to do—it is accepting that Christ has done everything we need to be right with God—and he did it on the cross.<font color= "blue"> “For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.” (Rom 5:10)</font>.<br> 
God reconciled the universe through Christ, <font color= "blue">
“having made peace through the blood of His cross” (Col 1:20)</font>. He did this before we believed it, before we were even born. And since we are reconciled through Him, all our sins are forgiven (Col 1:22)—reconciliation, forgiveness and justification all mean the same thing: peace with God.</p>
<h3>
Victory!
<h3>
<p>
Paul uses an interesting image of salvation when he writes that Jesus <font color= "blue">“Having disarmed principalities and powers, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in it.” (Col 2:15)</font>. <br>
He uses the word for a military parade: the winning general brings captured enemy soldiers in a victory parade at home. They are disarmed, humiliated, and put on display. Paul’s point here is that on the cross, Jesus did this to our enemies.</p>
<p>
What looked like a shameful death for Jesus was actually a glorious triumph for God’s plan, because it is through the cross that Jesus won victory over enemy powers, including Satan, sin and death. Their claim on us has been fully satisfied in the death of the innocent victim. They cannot demand any more than what He has already paid. They have nothing further to threaten us with.</p>


“By his death,” we are told, Jesus was able to “destroy him who holds the power of death—that is, the devil” (Hebrews 2:14). “The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil’s work” (1 John 3:8). Victory was won on the cross.
