<h1>
The Resurrection of Jesus
</h1>
<p>
As we approach the text, (Matt 28) a little bit of background. Remember the scene. Jesus was placed in the garden tomb. Friday He was buried. He was there all day Saturday. Now it was in the morning of Sunday, around dawn. A group of women came. There was an earthquake as they approached. When they got there, there was the stone rolled away, lying on the ground. Sitting on the stone was a blazing flaming angel in white garments sent from God. He had descended and caused the earthquake. Christ has been released out of the grave. He is alive. That announcement is made to the women. They check the tomb out. It is true. They begin to leave that place in Matthew's gospel and as they move along the road they are met by the risen Christ who speaks with them.</p>
<p>
Now meanwhile, remember what happened to the soldiers? When they saw the angel, <font color= "blue">"The guards shook for fear of him, and became like dead men." (Matt 28:4) Now I want you to remember this. The guards, the Roman guards saw the angel. It was their fear of that holy angel that caused them to faint and to go unconscious. They experienced the earthquake. They experienced the moving of the stone. They experienced the arrival of this heavenly messenger and it put them out. It was too fearful for them to even remain conscious. They went literally unconscious at the sight of this holy angel. So they have experienced this.</p>
<p> 
<font color= "blue">
Then Jesus said to them (the women), "Do not be afraid. Go and tell My brethren to go to Galilee, and there they will see Me." Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city ..." (Matt 28:10-11)</font>
And as they're going into the city looking for the disciples, the guard is going as well. And it says that some of them, not all of them, there may have been a dozen or more of them ... very likely a dozen of them, perhaps more. "Some of them go to make a report to the chief priests and show them all the things that were done." Now we don't know why some and not all, maybe some of them wanted to stay back by the grave. Maybe some of them were too frightened because they were afraid to expose the fact that they had lost the body they were supposed to be guarding and therefore would lose their lives because Roman law said that if a soldier fails in his duty, he pays with his life. Whatever the reason, just some of them went. And they had a duty they felt to report back to the chief priests.</p>
<p>
You ask, "Why didn't they report to the Roman commander Pilate?" Because Pilate had delegated them into the care of the chief priests. Go back to Matt 27.<br> 
<font color= "blue">
"On the next day, which followed the Day of Preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees gathered together to Pilate, saying, "Sir, we remember, while He was still alive, how that deceiver said, 'After three days I will rise.' Therefore command that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest His disciples come by night and steal Him away, and say to the people, 'He has risen from the dead.' So the last deception will be worse than the first." Pilate said to them, "You have a guard; go your way, make it as secure as you know how.". (Matt 27:62-65)</font></p>
 <p>
They went, made the sepulchre sure, sealing the stone and setting a guard." Now what happened here is the Jews went and said, "We want a guard." Pilate said, "Here is a guard." So in a sense the Jews then took charge. They set the guard. They instructed the guard, "Be careful, He said He's going to rise the third day. Be alert that His disciples don't come and steal the body on that third day." So they would have been very alert at this particular time on the third day, anticipating that this is in fact the time which was most critical in order to keep their guard alert. So when the women are going to the disciples, the soldiers are going back to the chief priests who are really the authority over them by delegation to report what had happened.</p>
<p>
The soldiers <font color= "blue">"reported to the chief priests all the things that had happened." (Matt 28:11)</font><br>
They described the earthquake. They described the rolling of the stone. They described the arrival of a blazing angel sitting on the stone. They described the empty tomb. It all happened and they described it all.</p>
<p>
Now we might assume that the leaders would say, "It is a resurrection." I mean, they didn't say to them, "The disciples came and stole the body." They knew better than that. What happened was an earthquake, an angel descending who rolls the stone away, sits on the stone and the tomb is empty. The disciples didn't come and steal the body, they knew that. They knew it was a supernatural event. And it may have been that factually and historically they understood that Jesus rose from the dead. They certainly knew He was dead. And so, they told that to the Jewish leaders. I believe that the Jewish leaders then were the first to hear about the resurrection in the sense that even before the disciples heard, they heard. But they didn't believe. They had said back in Matt 27, <font color= "blue"> "... let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe Him." (Matt 27:42)</font><br> 
They said we'll believe if He comes down from the cross. And here is something even greater, He came out of the grave but they didn't believe, they didn't even investigate. They didn't even go to find out. They didn't say, "Well, maybe it's true. Maybe He is the Messiah. Maybe He is alive. Maybe we ought to check it out." Not at all. They were so resistant and so blind and so sinful and so self-willed and so locked in to their own religious belief that they would not even investigate the truth that was reported to them by the soldiers. They refused to believe. The God of this world has blinded their minds, 2 Cor 4:4 says.</p>
<p>
The news brought shock. The news brought fear. But it did not bring repentance and it did not bring faith. They were without excuse. They were informed about the resurrection. They didn't question it. They didn't question those soldiers' validity. They didn't even investigate it. All they did instantaneously was say, "We can't let this get out. We've got to stop it. Whether it's a real one or not, we have to stop it. We're not interested in it. We're only interested in preventing people from hearing about it."</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"They had assembled with the elders and consulted together," (Matt 28:12)</font> that by the way is a phrase used frequently by Matthew and every time it's used it speaks of an official meeting of the Sanhedrin. So the Sanhedrin, which was the ruling body of elders in Israel, was convened officially ... immediately, to deal with the fact that something supernatural had happened at the grave, an earthquake, an angel, the tomb was empty, the body was gone. The disciples had not stolen it. The soldiers would have reported that clearly. They've got to answer this problem. If they allow the people to think Jesus is alive, they're going to have a worse situation than they've ever had. The whole city, the whole nation will go after this resurrected Christ. So they've got to lie about the resurrection.</p>
<p>
They called an official meeting. The second phrase "and consulted together" is also a formal phrase used in Matt 12:14, Matt 22:15. It's used also in Matt 27:1,7. Every time it's used it has to do with a formal resolution. What this means is there was an official convening of the Sanhedrin and they made or passed a formal resolution regarding what they were going to do with this information about Jesus not being in the tomb.</p>
<p>
The resolution was a three-part resolution. We'll see it as we look at the text.<br> First of all, it says when they had made the resolution,<font color= "blue"> "they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers." (Matt 28:12)</font><br> 
They had bought Judas for 30 pieces of silver, now they have to give much money. If there are a dozen guards or however there might have been, they're going to have to multiply that. And it may have been that they even had to give more than just 30 per person. They gave a great amount of money, but they were willing to pay any price to lie about the resurrection. They could not let the people think that Jesus had risen from the dead or the people would never follow them but only Jesus.</p>
<p>
So they paid a high price for the lie. 
So the first part of the resolution was to give money to the soldiers as bribery, as bribery.<br>
The second part of the resolution <font color= "blue">"Tell them, "His disciples came at night and stole Him away while we slept." (Matt 28:13)</font> Now they knew that wasn't true. That's not what they reported. But they were bribed to lie. They were told to tell a lie about the resurrection. The grave was empty. This is the only theory that's going to make any sense ... the disciples came and stole His body. All the other lying theories would leave the question about the body. This one will cover that.<br>
So, the soldiers became preachers of the anti-gospel for the sake of money. They were crass. They were materialistic. They were self-indulgent. The theory was a lie, they knew it was lie. But they were willing for money to say what the Jews wanted them to say.<br>
But there was a third part of the resolution and a very important one if you happen to be a Roman soldier. <font color= "blue">"And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will appease him and make you secure." (Matt 28:14)</font>.</p>
<p>
In other words, the soldiers were afraid that if Pilate heard this message that the disciples stole the body while we slept, that they would be court-martialed and lose their lives. So the Sanhedrin then had to make a provision to protect the Roman soldiers who were going to be the preachers of this lie. So they said we will go to Pilate and satisfy him. In other words, we will simply say, in effect, you gave us this guard, you dispatched them into our care, we are satisfied with what they did. While they were under our charge or command, under our delegated authority, we're satisfied. And we'll tell him that we're satisfied with you and thus will satisfy him. We'll plead your cause so that you're not court-martialed. And therefore we'll provide you to be secure, or literally the Greek word is "to make you without anxiety." Rest easy, we'll plead your cause if the message gets to Pilate.</p>
<p>
So, those were the three resolutions. Bribe the soldiers, tell them to preach that the disciples stole the body, and cover the soldiers if they got in trouble with Pilate. Now that was a planned resolution voted on and passed in the Sanhedrin. And what it tells us and what Matthew intends it to tell us is that the apostasy of the nation of Israel was final. Here their Messiah has risen from the dead and they are not the least bit interested in affirming whether or not it is true. They know a supernatural event occurred because an angel was there and an earthquake was there and the phenomena that occurred communicates that. They are not interested in investigating that. They don't want to know anything about that. They are obstinate in their apostasy and they wilfully reject Christ no matter what the evidence is. And therein lies Matthew's final testimony to the apostasy of Israel. The greatest miracle Jesus ever performed was His own resurrection from the dead and they are utterly uninterested in doing anything with that miracle except disproving it and denying it and lying about it.</p>
<p>
The soldiers' response was "So they took the money and did as they were instructed; and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day". (Matt 28:15)
And even to this day the prevalent anti-resurrection theory is the "theft theory" that the disciples stole His body.</p>
<p>
Now that leads us to the second point, the propagation. First of all, the soldiers did as they were taught. They propagated this lie. And Matthew then adds this interesting footnotes, "And this saying, or this logos, this word, this message that the disciples stole the body while the soldiers slept, is commonly reported among the Jews until this day." Matthew is writing about 30 years later, somewhere around 63 A.D. And he is saying at this very time 30 years later, this is the dominant theory circulating among the Jews that the disciples stole the body.</p>
<p>
The soldiers knew the truth. The Jewish leaders had every reason to know the truth. The soldiers had been there. They'd experienced the phenomena to some degree yet they were not believers. Quite the contrary. They become preachers of the anti-gospel. And maybe God had a purpose for that. One writer has said, "Not on historical faith but only on the faith of the heart rests the salvation of the world." In other words, God is not going to send out messengers to preach the resurrection who don't believe in the Christ of the resurrection. It's almost as if He sets these soldiers aside and makes them preachers of an anti-gospel lest they become preachers of a true resurrection who don't even believe in it. God in His eternal wisdom permitted that those guardians of the grave who might have been able to spread the historical faith in the world allowed themselves to become victimised by this monstrous lie and the resurrection of the Son of God would only be preached and attested to by those whose hearts were committed to the risen Christ.</p>
<p>
And they were successful at what they did. It was the common knowledge 30 years later when Matthew wrote...and you can even go further into say the year 114 to 165. In those years there was a man living by the name of Justin Martyr, one of the early church fathers. And he writes that this was still among the Jews the most common opinion. He writes this at that time, "You Jews selected men and sent them into all the world proclaiming that a certain atheistic and lawless sect has arisen from one Jesus, a Galilean deceiver whom we crucified, but His disciples stole Him by night from the tomb and deceived men by saying that He is risen from the dead and ascended into heaven." So even when you get half way into the second century, this is the commonly reported view among the Jews, that the disciples stole the body. And the lie is still around. It's still around today. There are people who still believe this.</p>
<p>
The narrative of the lie is then completed in Matt 28:15. But if we stop here we're going to miss the point because we have to talk about why it's here. What is the point? It's not just a negative way to end this gospel. It's not just a fill-in space. It's not just to make us think badly of those Jewish leaders. Why is it here? It is here, beloved, because it is a monumental and convincing proof of the reality of the resurrection. It does the very opposite of what it was intended to do. It is evidence supplied not by the friends of Jesus but by His enemies. Listen, it would be one thing for us and it is wonderful to do that, to accept the testimony of His friends as to the truth of His resurrection. But how much more convincing to accept the unwilling testimony of His enemies who in intending to hide the truth did nothing but expose it?</p>
<p>
Now if we looked at His friends, for example, we'd see a lot of evidence. We read Matthew, Mark, Luke, John and they tell us about the physical resurrection, they tell us about the stone being moved. They tell us about the grave clothes lying in perfect order. They tell us about the earthquake. They tell us about the testimony of holy angels. They tell us about ten separate appearances of Jesus after His resurrection.</p> 
<p>
First He appears to Mary Magdalene, then to the women, then to Peter, then to two on the road to Emmaus, then to twelve in the upper room, then eight days later to the disciples again in the upper room. Actually there were only eleven there, the ... actually ten the first time, Thomas was gone and, of course, Judas too. So He appeared to ten, then to the eleven eight days later, then the seventh appearance to seven disciples in Galilee recorded in John 21, an eighth appearance to the 500 in Galilee, then to James and finally to the eleven on the Mount of Olives as He ascended into heaven.</p> 
<p>
Ten separate appearances, we look at that, we look at all the testimony of His friends and His disciples and we say that's convincing testimony about the resurrection. And it is. Well over 500 witnesses. Well over ten separate appearances. There are others that we don't even know about. So much so that Acts 1 says there were many infallible truths by which Jesus affirmed His resurrection. I mean, let's face it, it's pretty convincing that the disciples all believe in the resurrection who at one time didn't even expect a resurrection. They were so soon convinced that there was never a single doubt in the mind of any Apostle. It wasn't nine to two, or seven to four, or six to five in voting for the resurrection. They were unanimous and unwavering. And they declared it without hesitation for the rest of their lives and they died for it, the majority of them. And this is amazing because they didn't even expect Jesus to rise.</p>
<p>
In Luke 24:11 it says when the women came and told them Jesus was alive, their words seem to them as idle tales for as yet, John 20:9 says, they knew not the Scripture that He must rise again from the dead. They weren't anticipating a resurrection. That's why they were moaning and groaning in sadness. Now what transformed them from cowards who never believed in a resurrection to heroes who fully believed in it?</p>
<p>
Furthermore, how is it that a group of men who ran in fear from the Jewish leaders when Jesus was taken captive run in courage right to the Jewish leaders to proclaim to them the resurrection? And when the Jewish leaders in Acts 4 tell them to stop doing it, they tell them they can't stop because God told them to do it and they will obey God rather than men. So what changed them? Their prejudices were not in favour of the resurrection. Yet soon after the resurrection they're ready to die for it. And remember this, they had access to all the evidence. They could check it all out. Something has changed. They were running in fear and denying Jesus and Peter is a coward. And then you see he on the day of Pentecost, he's preaching before thousands of people and telling the whole population that you crucified the Lord of glory, you killed the Prince of life and indicting them all.</p>
<p>
How can they be cowards one moment and bold confrontive preachers the next? By what power were they transformed? It wasn't the power of their speech. They were not eloquent, educated, brilliant, strong orators, masters of eloquence and logic, they were not charmers, they were not persuasive, they were poor simple illiterate some of them, what made a difference? The reality of the resurrection did. They believed it. And they had access to the evidence to prove it. They had a compelling powerful faith that caused them to die for the resurrection truth.

So, the testimony of His friends is very convincing because they were so very convinced against their own thoughts. But the testimony of His enemies, follow this, is even more astounding because it's so unexpected. Now follow this reasoning and you'll understand the reason this text is here. It was impossible for them to deny, that is for the Jews and the Roman soldiers, to deny that Christ had by some supernatural means left the grave, they couldn't deny that. They saw it. They could not deny that He left by some supernatural means. I mean, if He hadn't left and He was still there, they would have produced His body and said the thing is a hoax, folks, you see, here's His body. They couldn't deny it. The tomb was empty. The earthquake, the angel, the whole thing.</p>
<p>
All right, it was impossible then to come up with any other explanation than the one they invented. If they were going to deny the supernatural resurrection, they had no other choice but to explain that if the body wasn't there, somebody took it. That's all they have left. It's the only way to explain the empty tomb. So they come up with this explanation.</p>
<p>
When Peter is confronted a little later in the courtyard by the fire on several occasions, he denies Jesus Christ, he denies knowing Him, he denies following Him. Now the question I want to ask is if the disciples came and stole the body, how in the world did they get the courage to come when they knew there would be a Roman guard there or when they got there they saw that there was a Roman guard? How are we going to believe that these cowardly men who would not stand to defend or stand along side the living Christ whose power they had just seen displayed against those men, how are we to believe that they would now take their stand without the living Christ against the same people they were afraid of with Him? It's absurd. I mean, they were basically huddling somewhere in fear. They weren't about to come out against the Roman army. Peter, the boldest and strongest and most courageous of them, at least verbally, denied Jesus Christ even to a little girl.</p>
<p>
You say, "Well, maybe they bribed the soldiers." With what? They bribed the soldiers, the Jews did, and they had to give them much money. The disciples didn't have anything. They had nothing with which to bribe.</p>
<p>
Furthermore, they didn't believe in a resurrection so why are they there falsifying one? Furthermore, why in the world would they want to go out and die for a resurrection hoax that they themselves knew was a hoax? No, it's impossible to believe this explanation.</p>
<p>
Furthermore, it is impossible to believe that all the Roman soldiers were asleep. I mean, your basic Roman soldier knew better than that. You say, "Yes, but it was a long night." Well, you don't understand, the night was divided into four watches. A watch would be no more than three hours at the most and no less than two. It could be two and a half, could be closer to two, could be close to three. That's not a long period of time for a Roman soldier to stay awake, and then he gets his time to sleep and another soldier or two or three or four or five stay awake while the others sleep. They rotated their watches. It's impossible to believe that they all fell asleep at the same time.</p>
<p>
Furthermore, for a Roman soldier to fall asleep on duty and lose the cause for which he had been enlisted was to pay with his life. Now they knew the price was too high to fall asleep. It's absurd. It is impossible to believe. It's also impossible to believe that the Jews would have bribed the soldiers to tell the truth. It's so interesting that it says they gave them much money and said just tell everyone the disciples stole His body. The fact that they gave them money tells us very clearly this is bribery. And the bribery has to do with telling a lie. You don't bribe people to tell the truth.</p>
<p>
What Matthew is showing us is anything but the resurrection is an absurdity. It offends our reason. It offends our logic. It offends the facts. And thus does Matthew prove the resurrection by the lie. Men had to be paid to say the disciples stole the body. It's a lie for which bribery was necessary. They had to say an absurdity. We know the disciples came and stole the body while we were asleep which is an absolute contradiction and makes no sense.</p>
<p>
The simple testimony of Scripture and the complex testimony of Scripture is that Jesus rose from the dead and Matthew is telling us here that you can take the testimony of His friends or you can take the testimony of His enemies and you're going to come up with the very same conclusion. And he includes the testimony of His enemies, as I said, for two reasons. 
Reason number one, it shows us the depth and the totality of the apostasy of Israel. 
And secondly, it is the most convincing evidence.</p>
<p>
Simon Greenleaf, a Harvard professor of law, some years ago wrote, "All that Christianity asks of men is that they would be consistent with themselves, that they would treat its evidences as they treat the evidence of other things and that they would try to judge its actors and witnesses as they deal with their fellow men when testifying to human affairs and actions in human tribunals. The result would be an undoubting conviction of their integrity, ability and truth," end quote.</p>
<p>
And as I said last time, it is the assessment of those who study the resurrection that there is no other historical event that is as truly and thoroughly attested to as the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. The Lord arose. The folly of this hopeless explanation only demonstrates the reality of the resurrection. And because He lives, He gives life to all who believe in Him.</p>
<p>
In Rom 10 there are two great verses that bring this right down to our own lives:
<font color= "blue">
"it says that, "if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation." (Rom 10:9-10) </font><br>
Salvation is equal to eternal life. Salvation is equal to deliverance from sin. Salvation is equal to hope. Salvation determines our eternal destiny in the presence of God in the glories of heaven forever. And salvation belongs to those who believe in the resurrection and who confess Jesus as Lord by that resurrection and therefore identify themselves with Him.</p>
<p>
How do you respond to the resurrection? Well, as I said in the very beginning, there are many who explain it away and in doing that they commit spiritual suicide. They slay all of their hope as well as the meaning of life now. And then there are those who believe. And they do not believe as wishful thinking. They do not believe as if it were against the facts. They believe because the facts are so clear and the evidence so strong. And in believing, they receive eternal life. That's the message of the Christian gospel that in Christ who died and rose again there is life. </p>
