<h1>
A Parable of Forgiveness
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
Then Peter came to Him and said, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?" Jesus said to him, "I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven. Therefore the kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants. And when he had begun to settle accounts, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents. But as he was not able to pay, his master commanded that he be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and that payment be made. The servant therefore fell down before him, saying, 'Master, have patience with me, and I will pay you all.' Then the master of that servant was moved with compassion, released him, and forgave him the debt. But that servant went out and found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii; and he laid hands on him and took him by the throat, saying, 'Pay me what you owe!' So his fellow servant fell down at his feet and begged him, saying, 'Have patience with me, and I will pay you all.' And he would not, but went and threw him into prison till he should pay the debt. So when his fellow servants saw what had been done, they were very grieved, and came and told their master all that had been done.  Then his master, after he had called him, said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me. Should you not also have had compassion on your fellow servant, just as I had pity on you?' And his master was angry, and delivered him to the torturers until he should pay all that was due to him. So My heavenly Father also will do to you if each of you, from his heart, does not forgive his brother his trespasses." (Matt 18:21-35)</font></p>
<p>
Most people have read the first part of Matt 18. It outlines a procedure for taking to task a believer who has sinned against you. Many an aggressive stance has been justified with this passage. But in my time as a pastor and counsellor, I was surprised at how few of those applying the procedure had read the rest of the chapter. While chapter breaks are not inspired, and Peter’s question to the Lord about forgiveness (Matt 18:21) could have been asked at another time, it does appear next in sequence to the procedure for righting a wrong.</p>
<p>
How many petty disputes could be dropped if put into the context of this parable? How would they rate in a comparison to what the Lord has forgiven in us? Do we, having been forgiven so much, refuse to forgive our brothers and sisters even a little? And if so, what are the real consequences?</p>
<h3>
The Rest Of The Story
</h3>
<p>
We’ve often discussed the nature of parables; how they’re heavenly stories put into an earthly context and how the major characters always symbolise others. In the case of this parable the King is the Lord, you and I are His servants, the debts we owe represent our sins, and the jailer is Satan.</p>
<p>
Identifying the King and His servants is easy.  They represent the Lord and His followers.   As to the debts owed, two denominations of money are mentioned, the 10,000 talents the servant owed the king and the 100 denarii the servant was owed by another. Let’s take the easy one first. Almost everyone agrees that a denarius was equivalent to one day’s wages. If 100 days equalled about 1/3 of a working year then repaying that size debt would require about 4 months of an average person’s income. That’s not an insignificant sum.</p>
<p>
Since a talent was both a measure of weight (about 85 lbs. or 34 kg.) and of money, its value is much more difficult to define, but the most frequent description I found in my research is that it would have approximated 15 times an average person’s annual income. If so, then a debt of 10,000 talents would require 150,000 years of an average person’s income to re-pay, an impossibly large amount.</p>
<p>
And that’s the first point. The King had forgiven a debt the servant couldn’t have repaid in a hundred lifetimes, and did so simply because he was asked to. The servant on the other hand demanded full and immediate payment from a friend for a much, much smaller sum. Now 4 months wages is a debt worthy of collection, and forgiving an amount that size would be a major sacrifice for most people. But the issue is not the legitimacy or even the size of the debt, it’s the comparative value. Shouldn’t being released from the burden of a debt so large he could never repay it have made the servant even a little more forgiving toward his brother?</p>
<p>
The servant’s demand for payment demonstrated his lack of gratitude for what the King had done for him, and that’s what aroused the King’s anger. Summoning the Jailer, the King ordered his servant punished until he repaid all he owed.</p>
<h3>
If The Shoe Fits ...
</h3>
<p>
Our debt of sin against the Lord is similarly impossible to repay, but in the Lord’s case He can’t simply overlook it. His requirement for justice demands the debt be paid in full. Knowing this, He sent His Son to pay it for us. This freed Him to completely and unconditionally forgive us just because we ask Him to. Don’t forget, from the Lord’s point of view we were all murderers, adulterers, blasphemers and thieves when He forgave us (Eph 2:1-5). These are all crimes punishable by death. We’ve been forgiven so much, isn’t even a significant sacrifice justifiable under the circumstances? What offence would be too large to forgive in others when compared with what the Lord has forgiven in us?</p>
<p>
Our unwillingness to forgive legitimate sins our friends commit against us demonstrates our ingratitude for what the Lord has done for us. It’s the result of the typical human double standard wherein we demand justice from others while expecting mercy for ourselves. This ingratitude is itself a sin and like all unconfessed sin leaves us open to attack by our enemy which can cause us great torment.  Therefore, in the parable the jailer represents Satan.</p>
<h3>
Union And Fellowship
</h3>
<p>
Like the servant and the King our relationship with the Lord consists of two components, union and fellowship.  Union is unconditional and eternal.   The servant didn’t stop being a servant to the King just because of his bad behaviour, and neither do we ever stop being the children of our Lord because of ours.  When He went to the cross, Jesus took all our sins with Him and because of His death we have been forgiven for every one of them (Col 2:13-15)</p>
<p>
But fellowship is conditional and temporal.  Because of his behaviour the servant had caused a rift in his relationship with the King.  He could only restore himself to the King’s good graces and stop the punishment by repaying the debt. Our behaviour can like wise cause a rift in our relationship with the Lord.  We can only restore ourselves to the Lord’s good graces and stop the torment by applying the payment already made on our behalf for all our sins.</p>
<p>
“If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9)<p>
<p>
Please note that John was writing to forgiven sinners, members of the church, advising us to confess and be forgiven even after we’ve been saved. We sin every day and His mercies are new every morning.  God forgives us whenever we ask, every time we ask. (For me that’s been many more than seventy times seven.)</p>
<h3>
You Always Get What You Ask For
</h3>
God’s Nature demands justice and fair play. Refusing to forgive when we’ve been forgiven is a sin that causes a rift in our relationship with Him that only we can mend. Forgiving the friend who sinned against us  restores us to fellowship with the Lord and allows Him to forget there ever was a problem.</p>
