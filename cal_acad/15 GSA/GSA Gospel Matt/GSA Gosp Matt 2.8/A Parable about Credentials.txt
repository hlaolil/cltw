<h1>
A Parable about Credentials
</h1>
<h3>
The Background
</h3>
<p>
On the Monday of the last week of His earthly ministry, Jesus rode into Jerusalem on a donkey and was hailed as the Messiah. On Tuesday, He chased all the money changers out of the temple. Now it is Wednesday. He will be crucified on Friday and will rise from the dead on Sunday. The crowd however was alarmed because the day after they hailed Him as Messiah, He overthrew the Jewish religious system instead of overthrowing the Roman government. They didn't know how to fit that into their expectations of what the Messiah was supposed to do.</p>
<p>
On Wednesday He was back in the Temple He had cleansed, teaching the good news of the Kingdom of God. The magnetism of His personality and the dynamics of His teaching fascinated the people.</p>
<h3>
The Leader's Jealousy of Jesus
</h3>
<p>
That made the Jewish religious leaders irate. They resented Jesus Christ because He unmasked their pride and self- righteousness. They not only resented Him because He opposed their religion, but also because He captured the fascination of the people. Envy and jealousy filled their hearts. They resented His purging the Temple without their permission. He was genuine and they were hypocrites. He threatened their system of self-righteousness, which was opposed to God's system of faith in the righteousness of Christ.</p>
<h3>
The Leader's Questioning of Jesus
<h3>
<p>
They stopped Him while He was teaching and asked,<font color= "blue"> "By what authority are You doing these things? And who gave You this authority" (Matt 21:23)</font>. They wanted Jesus to show them His credentials. They were in effect, saying, "Show us your rabbinical ordination papers. Prove to us that you have the right to say what you are saying." Jesus then asked them a question. When they refused to answer, Jesus in turn said, <font color= "blue">"Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things." (Matt 21:27)</font>. In three separate parables, He made clear that they were under the judgement of God.</p>
<h3>
The Parable of the Two Sons 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Jesus said, "A man had two sons, and he came to the first and said, 'Son, go, work today in my vineyard.' He answered and said, 'I will not,' but afterwards he regretted it and went. Then he came to the second and said likewise. And he answered and said, 'I go, sir,' but he did not go. Which of the two did the will of his father?" They said to Him, "The first." Jesus said to them, "Assuredly, I say to you that tax collectors and harlots enter the kingdom of God before you. For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him; but tax collectors and harlots believed him; and when you saw it, you did not afterwards relent and believe him."(Matt 21:28-32)</font></p>
<p>
Jesus was saying the chief priests and the elders were like the second son, who said he would obey but never did. They kept saying they were going to obey God but never did and as a result would be kept out of the Kingdom. Tax collectors and harlots were like the other son who defied God at first, but in the end repented and obeyed.</p>
