Parables in Matthew
</h1>
<h3>
1. Parable of the Sower
</h3>
<p>
Jesus explained that a certain sower sowed seed and some fell on rocky ground and didn’t take root and the sun withered it and it died.  Other seed was sown on ground that had thorns which choked out the seed. Only the seed that was sown on fertile ground took root and produced differing amounts of grain.</p>
<p>
There is no need to explain this parable because Jesus explained the meaning Himself by saying “When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path. As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy, yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away. </p>
<p>
As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful.  As for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it. He indeed bears fruit and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.”</p>
<h3>
2. Parable of the Wheat and Weeds 
</h3>
<p>
Jesus explains that there was good seed in the fields but while the man slept, the enemy came in and sowed weed seed among the wheat and they both grew together and when the man’s servants came and told him and asked if they could gather them up the tares the Master said, <font color= "blue">“'No, lest while you gather up the tares you also uproot the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, "First gather together the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn." (Matt 13:29-30)</font></p>
<p>
I believe Jesus is saying that today there are many false converts in the church and that they will be allowed to stay in the church but at the Master’s coming, He will separate them and send some to the fire (judgement) and others into the barn  (the kingdom).  Wheat and tares are hard to tell apart when they have sprouted and even when they are growing but the difference is seen by what they produce.  Wheat produces grain (fruits) but weeds produce only more weeds, good only for the burn pile (Matt 13:36-43).</p>
<h3>
3. Parable of the Mustard Seed
<h3>
<p>
The kingdom is seen as a mustard seed, among the smallest of all but when it’s grown large, it is big enough for birds to nest in its branches. The kingdom of heaven began as the smallest of seeds in the 1st century and today is still growing and eventually, will encompass the entire universe (Isa 9).</p>
<h3>
4. Parable of the Leaven
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till it was all leavened." (Matt 13:33)</font> which could mean that the true children of God may not be easily discerned by sight and will not be evident until “all was leavened” or at the coming of the kingdom.</p>
<h3>
5. Parable of the Hidden Treasure 
</h3>
<p>
In this parable, the kingdom is like a treasure that’s been buried and covered up.  The man, in his joy, goes and sells all that he has to buy the field.  Is this about Jesus’ selling all He had by giving His life a ransom for many and that the kingdom has been hidden up to the time of Jesus’ ministry and only brought to the surface by the Master who purchased the field with His own blood?  Jesus never does explain the meaning of this parable.</p>
<h3>
6. Parable of the Pearl of Great Price 
</h3>
<p>
The kingdom resembles a merchant searching for fine pearls and when he finds “the one pearl of great value” he sells everything that He has to purchase it.  Again, is this Jesus’ way of saying that He gives all that He has, including His own life, to buy what is beyond what anyone could ever buy on their own?  Is this not also referencing Jesus seeking out those who would become the children of God since we know that no one seeks after God (Rom 3:11-12) but the hounds of heaven seek us out (John 6:44) and we don’t come to faith on our own human effort but salvation is fully a gift of God (Eph 2:8-9)</p>
<h3>
7. Parable of the Net
</h3>
<p>
Jesus is obviously pointing out how the kingdom of heaven is brought to pass.  Here He compares it to casting a net and the net catches both good and bad fish and those which are not good to eat are cast aside to be thrown into the “fiery furnace” (judgement) by God’s holy angels where “there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth” (hell) but the righteous are separated from these and thrown into good containers (the kingdom). This also may be speaking to the fact that God draws men to Himself and so He is the one casting the net to catch the souls of men and women (John 15:16).</p>
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
In Matthew 13, Jesus is speaking about the likeness of the kingdom of heaven and the harvest of the souls.  Many who are tares believe that they are going to be in the harvest but instead of hearing Jesus’ welcome them, He will say to them <font color= "blue">“"Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven. Many will say to Me in that day, 'Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name?' And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!'” (Matt 7:21-23)</font>. </p>  
<p>
Today, Jesus is letting the tares grow up alongside the wheat but some day, perhaps soon, He will come and separate them.  One will be bundled up to be cast into the fire (Rev 20:11-15) but the others will be brought into the Master’s barn (Rev 21) and like the leaven and the mustard seed, it will continue to grow and expand without end <font color= "blue">“and the government shall be upon His shoulder” (Isa 9:6b)</font> and <font color= "blue">“Of the increase of His government and peace There will be no end” (Isa 9:7a)</font>.  The question is, are you in that kingdom?</p>
