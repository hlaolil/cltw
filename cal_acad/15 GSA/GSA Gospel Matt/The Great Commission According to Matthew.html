   <h1>
The Great Commission <br>According to Matthew
</h1>
<h3>
Jesus' Declaration
</h3>
<p>
Before Jesus ascended back to heaven, He gathered His disciples together and declared:
<font color= "blue">
..."All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. <br>Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age." (Matt 28:18-20)</font>.</p>
<p>
So reads what is commonly called “the great commission,” as presented in Matthew’s Gospel record. This narrative is a gold mine, strewn here and there with spiritual nuggets which enrich the soul. Let us explore this divine depository of truth.</p>
<h3>
Authority
</h3>
<p>
The basis of the Lord’s “marching orders” is His authority. “All authority has been given to Me,” declared the risen Saviour.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
First</font></p>
<p>
Though the verbal “has been given” is past tense, it anticipates the imminent coronation of Christ, following His ascension, <br><font color= "blue"> when He (God) ... seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality and power and might and dominion ..." (Eph 1:20,21)</font>.</p>
<p>
Sometimes a past tense form is idiomatically employed in prophecy to denote the certainty of an event. While it is true that Jesus exercised divine authority during His teaching ministry (cf. Matt 7:29; 10:1,7,8; 22:43,44), at the time of His return to the Father, that authority was expanded, i.e., exercised both in heaven and on earth.<br> Only the Father Himself is excepted from this reign (cf. 1 Cor 15:27, 8). Surely this declaration of the regal authority of Jesus Christ is evidence of His deity.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Second </font></p>
<p>
The fact that such authority was “given” to the Lord is a commentary on His subordination to the Father. Prior to the incarnation, i.e., the point at which the eternal Word (cf. John 1:1) became flesh (cf. John 1:14), the Second Person of the Godhead possessed an “equality” with Jehovah.</p>
<p>
In assuming the “likeness of man,” however, the Lord chose not to retain that equality. Rather, He “emptied Himself” of the independent exercise of certain divine prerogatives, and yielded to the will of His Father (see Phil 2:5ff). </p>
<p><font size="+1">
Third</font></p>
<p> During His reign, Christ would delegate certain authority (e.g., to the apostles — cf. Matt 19:28); yet, there is no biblical evidence whatever that He would appoint any earthly dignitary to function as “the visible head of the Church on earth,” as is claimed by Roman Catholic writers. <br>Jesus is “the [exclusive] head” of that institution (Col 1:18).</p>
<h3>
Make Disciples
</h3>
<p>
In the Greek text, Matt 28:19 begins with a participle, literally, “having gone.” But participles may sometimes be used in the imperative (command) sense, hence, it is not improper to render the term as “Go” in this passage. <br>Christ thus admonished His men to go forth and “make disciples.”</p>
<p>
The expression “make disciples” is also a command. The basic form of the word is actually “a learner.” Etymology thus suggests that a disciple is one who “stands in relation to another as pupil and is instructed by that person” <br>
There is a clear implication in the use of this term. One who is subject to baptism is one who is capable of being a student, a learner.<br>
Matthew Henry, a Presbyterian, observed that discipling intimates that
“the essentials of the religion of Jesus, — the remoulding of the character, through the truth, — is necessary to entitle any individual to baptism”.<br>
Obviously, therefore, infants are excluded. The New Testament knows nothing of baby-baptism.</p>
<h3>
Facts about Baptism
</h3>
<p>
The Master’s men were commissioned to disciple converts, baptising them.<br> This clearly reveals that the baptism was humanly administered. <br>Thus, this reference to immersion is not an allusion to some sort of “Spirit” baptism.</p>
<p>
Too, the fact that baptism is administered by a second party demonstrates that the mode is such that it cannot be self-imposed, as is the case with sprinkling or pouring. <br>In genuine baptism, the candidate is passive; he is “raised” [by another] to walk in newness of life (Col 2:12; Rom 6:4). Sprinkling and pouring are post-apostolic innovations.</p>
<p>
This context also speaks indirectly to the purpose of baptism. This is indicated in two ways.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
First </font></p>
<p>
We must comment briefly again on the term “disciple.” This word eventually takes on a technical sense whereby it is equivalent to a “Christian” <br>(cf. Acts 6:7; 11:26).<br> Apparently, by anticipation, the word is employed in that sense in Matthew’s commission, for the apostle suggests we are to “make disciples ... baptising them.”</p>
<p>
The participle (“baptising”) explains “the manner in which the given action [”make disciples"] was performed". Thus, in the final analysis, one formally becomes a Christian when he or she is immersed into a relationship with the Godhead.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Second </font></p>
<p>
Immersion is said to be "into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." The expression “into the name” is interesting. In New Testament Greek it signified that “the one who is baptised becomes the possession of and comes under the protection of” the one into whose name he is immersed.</p>
<p>
Hence, one is not possessed by the divine Godhead until he submits to baptism and that baptism “into the name” of the Triune God means that one enters a relationship of “communion” with Deity by that act.<br>
In the light of such lucid instruction, how can anyone deny that immersion is essential to a proper relationship with God?</p>
<h3>
The Godhead — Three, Not One
</h3>
<p>
Matthew’s account of the commission also contains a solid argument for the doctrine of the Trinity. Jesus stated that those discipled must be immersed “into the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit.”</p>
<p>
Of special interest is the fact that each of the nouns — Father, Son, and Holy Spirit — is preceded by the definite article (rendered “the” in the English Bible). <br>
On the other hand, when the article is repeated before each noun, “the distinctness of each” thing or person (as in the present case) is emphasised. Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are thus not merely three qualities of the One-Person God, as alleged by the United Pentecostal Church. Rather, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are three separate divine Persons.</p>
<h3>
Continuing Instruction
</h3>
<p>
After one leads his student into a knowledge of and obedience to the Son of God, there is an abiding responsibility to instruct the novice in the fundamentals of the faith.
Consistent with this admonition, for example, is the fact that elders are required to “feed the flock” (Acts 20:28). But here is an intriguing question. If elders and teachers are required to feed, are the students obligated to eat?<br>
It is a matter of utter amazement, not to mention consternation, that so many members of the body of Christ today feel that church attendance, beyond a Lord’s supper service on Sunday, is purely a matter of option.
Do passages like Titus 2:14; Heb 10:25, and James 4:17 have any meaning at all? Waning Bible study attendance is a sad commentary on the condition of today’s church.</p>
<h3>
Abiding Presence of Christ
</h3>
<p>
Jesus declared that if His people carry out the commission imposed, He would be "with you always, even to the end of the age.” Is there a more comforting New Testament passage emphasising the providential activity of the Saviour?</p>
<p>
Later, Paul could say:<br>
<font color= "blue">“At my first defence no one stood with me, but all forsook me ... But the Lord stood with me and strengthened me,” (2 Tim 4:16,17)</font>.<br>
Truly, Matthew’s Commission is brimming with rich information. Let us be refreshed thereby.</p>
