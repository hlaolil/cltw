   <h1>
The Power to Prosper
</h1>
<p>
There are more than 2000 references to money and possessions in the Bible. There are more verses about money than about heaven, hell, salvation or Jesus. And today, there's nothing in your life, church, home, school or work that isn't somehow tied to money.</p>
<p>
Of the 38 parables Jesus related, 16 deal with how we handle money. <br>One out of 10 verses in the gospels deals with money and possessions!<br> We also find that in the four Gospels, Jesus talked 10 per cent more about money then He did about heaven and hell combined!</p>
<p>
Most people think "money" when they hear the word "prosperity."<br> There is incompleteness in this thought because prosperity covers your entire life. It covers your marriage, your health, your children, your relationships, your recreation and yes - your finances. That's what the apostle John meant when he penned <font color= "blue">"Beloved, I pray that you may prosper in all things and be in health, just as your soul prospers." (3 John 2)</font>. </p>
<p>God wants us to prosper in every area of our lives, including our finances.</p>
<h3>
Prosperity in action
</h3>
<p>
Prosperity isn't a certain money amount-it is simply having all your needs and desires met. It is about having abundance you can share with others.<br> It's about freedom, fewer worries and less stress so you can spend more time serving others.
For example, I had the privilege of speaking to a group of several thousand millionaires. Most weren't Christian and following the meeting, a smaller group of approximately 340 went into a separate ballroom to eat and talk. During this time, I was invited to talk with a business associate about a philanthropic venture in Africa.</p>
<p>
I talked for about five minutes when the leader stood up and said, "I love what these guys are doing! Let's support them!" Everyone clapped and cheered.<br> "Let's donate to them!" Again, everyone cheered and clapped. Then they wrote cheques. In five minutes, they gave an astonishing $742,000! They were smiling, laughing and happy. That is called "freedom."</p>
<p>
From that meeting, I flew directly to a church to do the same seminar.<br> There were about 400 attending and over the weekend, the church took up four collections for a grand total of $1169.83! The people gave with long faces, as they didn't have money to spare. This is called "bondage."</p>
<p>
You see, when you read the Bible, God intended His people to be leaders in all things. <br>He says,<font color= "blue"> "The Lord will command the blessing on you in your storehouses and in all to which you set your hand, ... The Lord will establish you as a holy people to Himself, just as He has sworn to you, if you keep the commandments of the Lord your God and walk in His ways. Then all peoples of the earth shall see that you are called by the name of the Lord, ... And the Lord will grant you plenty of goods, in the fruit of your body, in the increase of your livestock, and in the produce of your ground, ... The Lord will open to you His good treasure, the heavens, to give the rain to your land in its season, and to bless all the work of your hand. You shall lend to many nations, but you shall not borrow. And the Lord will make you the head and not the tail; you shall be above only, and not be beneath, if you heed the commandments of the Lord your God, which I command you today, and are careful to observe them." (Deut 28:8-13)</font>.</p>
<p>
All around the world, I find wealthier people are far happier, loving and giving than poor people. Abundance of wealth and financial resources brings freedom. A lack of wealth and financial resources bring bondage.</p>
<h3>
The Biblical view of Money
</h3>
<p>
There are several observations that are crystal clear in the study of what the Bible actually teaches about money. The first is that all comments in the Bible that sound anti-wealth are actually directed at greed and coveting. <br>If your passion, desires and attitudes are misdirected and the desire for money and things is primary in your life, then you are "greedy."</p>
<p>
The Bible is also clear that God wants His people to prosper so they can be generous, not greedy. A passion, desire and attitude to gain wealth in order to bless others is a godly thing. Money is like manure. If you stack it up it stinks. <br>If you spread it around, it does a whole lot of good.</p>
<p>
The second is that the most prominent people in the Bible, the important leaders, were mostly wealthy people. Who did God choose to be father of His people and the Old Testament church? The richest man in the land, Abraham. <font color= "blue">"Abram was very rich in livestock, in silver, and in gold" (Gen 13:2)</font>.<p>
<p>
Jacob was incredibly wealthy, as was Joseph. Boaz was wealthy, Job was super wealthy, David had huge wealth and his son, Solomon, is to this day the richest man ever. The "prudent" woman, the ideal wife of Proverbs, is a wealthy businesswoman. Nicodemus, according to history, financed the early Christian church for over 30 years.</p>
<p>
The third thing is many Bible books have important lessons for us regarding money. Solomon, the wisest man who ever lived, authored two books, Proverbs and Ecclesiastes. In them, he gave hundreds of powerful and useful principles regarding wealth, work, diligence, saving, enjoying the fruit of your labour and giving to others.</p>
<p>
Finally, when you take the few New Testament passages used to condemn wealth in context, you discover that Jesus wasn't condemning people for their wealth but holding them accountable. Close study reveals not one verse of condemnation for being rich. It is always in the context of desire and motive.</p>
<h3>
The Which-way of Wealth
</h3>
<p>
The Bible contains nine powerful principles of wealth:</p>
<p>
1. Use wisdom and you will become rich. <br><font color= "blue">"Length of days is in her right hand, in her left hand riches and honour" <br>(Prov 3:16)</font>.</p>
<p>
2. God gives riches and wealth.<br><font color= "blue"> "As for every man to whom God has given riches and wealth, and given him power to eat of it, to receive his heritage and rejoice in his labour — this is the gift of God" (Eccl 5:19)</font>.</p>
<p>
3. It is God who gives you power to acquire wealth.<br><font color= "blue"> "And you shall remember the Lord your God, for it is He who gives you power to get wealth," (Deut 8:18)</font>.</p>
<p>
4. If you fear God, wealth and riches will be in your home.<br> <font color= "blue">"Blessed is the man who fears the Lord, ... Wealth and riches will be in his house," (Psa 112:1,3)</font>.</p>
<p>
5. Put God first and He will bless you.<br><font color= "blue"> "In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall make smooth your paths. Honour the Lord with your possessions, and with the first fruits of all your increase; so your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will overflow with new wine" (Prov 3:6,9,10) </font>.</p>
<p>
6. Save for the future.<br><font color= "blue">"There is desirable treasure, and oil in the dwelling of the wise, but a foolish man squanders it" (Prov 21:20)</font>.</p>
<p>
7. Proper preparation for the future.<br><font color= "blue"> "A prudent man foresees evil and hides himself, but the simple pass on and are punished" (Prov 22:3)</font>.</p>
<p>
8. Hard work produces wealth.<br> <font color= "blue">"He who has a slack hand becomes poor, but the hand of the diligent makes rich" (Prov 10:4)</font>. (See also Proverbs 13:4; 24: 3, 4; 14:23; 28:19; 12:24).</p>
<p>
9. Employ proper estate planning.<br> <font color= "blue">"A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children," (Prov 13:22)</font>.</p>
<h3>
Qualifications on Wealth
</h3>
<p>
The one principle that rings true, from Genesis to Revelation, is that there are biblical qualifications for prosperity. God blesses those who follow, obey and commit their lives to Him.<br> It says,<font color= "blue"> "Praise the Lord! Blessed is the man who fears the Lord, who delights greatly in His commandments. His descendants will be mighty on earth; the generation of the upright will be blessed. Wealth and riches will be in his house, and his righteousness endures forever" (Psa 112:1-3)</font>.</p>
<p>
It doesn't say wealth and riches might be in his house-it says wealth and riches will be. But God says this is predicated on how you follow His Word.<br> <font color= "blue">"This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success" (Josh 1:8)</font>.</p>
<h3>
Think and Be
</h3>
<p>
Both wealth and poverty are part of our belief systems, not a condition of being with or being without money. They have to do with a person's overall quality of life. They are based on a person's attainment or lack of tangible and intangible assets-things such as money, material possessions and resources, as well as love, time, relationships, living a purpose-filled life and physical health.</p>
<p>
To be "rich" is to be abundantly supplied to carry out God's will for your life and have surplus to help someone else, whereas "poor" is the exact opposite. When you are poor, you are incapable of carrying out God's will for your life as it pertains to helping anyone else, due to a lack of resources of all kinds.</p>
<p>
Both poverty and riches are the offspring of thought! What a person thinks about himself becomes self-fulfilling. People become their dominant thoughts!
Says the apostle Paul,<font color= "blue"> "Now to Him who is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,"<br> (Eph 3:20)</font>.</p> 
<p>
So the principles the world uses to gain wealth were in the Word of God all the time! As we walk in harmony with the Bible in the area of our finances and claim the promises God has made to us regarding living the abundant life, we will then lead the world as the head, not the tail. Wealth creation and prosperity is as much a faith-trust walk with God as anything else is. That's why today the Christian faith as a whole is well overdue in becoming financially literate and wisely handling the wealth that God has entrusted to her.</p>
<h3>
A Balancing Act
</h3>
<p>
It is important to look at money and prosperity with a balanced approach to the Bible. We want to stay away from one extreme or the other.<br> So ask yourself, "Is God magnified by my scraping along, living hand to mouth with no money to support His work?<br> Or is He magnified if I'm living extravagantly, focusing all my attention and time on money and worldly possessions?"<br>
The answer to both is "No!"</p>
<p>
There must be balance and common sense in our material lives, and in our attainment of wealth and prosperity. It's important to stay out of the ditches on both sides of road because both lead to a misunderstanding and misapplication of the funds He has allowed us.</p>
<p>
To be truly balanced in respect to wealth and prosperity, and study the subject of money in the Bible, requires looking at all the evidence. The thing about God's Word is that it levels the playing field. Racial or social background doesn't matter. Adhering to the teaching of God's Word will benefit whosoever will act upon it.</p>
<p>
Learning God's Word and doing God's Word are the only requirements for success. God wants to prosper all His children in every area of their lives, including their finances:<br> <font color= "blue">"Wisdom is the principle thing, therefore get wisdom: and with all your getting get understanding" (Prov 4:7)</font>.</p>
<p>
To summarise, Israel was given earthly promises and rewards as God's chosen people on earth. He gave many illustrations and types and truths through them. Many people desire to take their blessings, but not their curses. However, in the progression of revelation, God has revealed through Jesus Christ a more excellent ministry:<font color= "blue"> “But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as He is also Mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises” (Heb 8:6)</font>.</p>
<p>
God does not condemn anyone for having riches. Riches come to people from many sources, but He gives grave warnings to those who seek after them more than they seek after God and trust in them more than in God. <br>His greatest desire is for us to set our hearts on things above and not on things on this earth. This may sound very high and unobtainable, but Paul wrote, <br><font color= "blue">“I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me” (Phil 4:13)</font>. <br>The secret is knowing Christ as Saviour and allowing the Holy Spirit to conform our minds and heart to His (Rom 12:1-2).</p>
