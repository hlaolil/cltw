Praying in Church
</h1>
<p>
Prayer is talking to God. The Christian who relies on the Bible as his or her source of revelation about God finds the purpose, practice and meaning of prayer in the teachings of Jesus.</p>
<p>
The Bible introduces us to different types of prayer.<br>
<font color= "blue">
Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit,  being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints--. (Eph 6:18)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue"> 
Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men, (1 Tim 2:1)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; (Phil 4:6)</font></p>
<p>
Based on a brief review of the above scriptures we can identify four broad ways of talking to God, namely:</p>
<h3>
Supplications
</h3>
<p>
(Sometimes translated as petitions, entreaties or requests)<br>
Supplication means to petition or entreat someone for something.<br> A passionate zeal and hunger fuels the prayer of supplication. </p>
<p>
Strictly speaking supplication is not another form of prayer but an attitude that accompanies prayer.<br> (Luke 11:9-13; James 5:17-18; 1 Kings 18:1-46; 1 Kings 8:37-40,54-55).<p>
<p>Supplications are requests that come from a heart crying out to God.<br> The prayer of supplication can sometimes lead us into fasting (Neh 1:1-6). Supplications draw us close to God and take the weight off our shoulders.
<h3>
Intercessions
</h3>
<p>
To intercede means to plead or mediate on behalf of another person. Intercession will involve various degrees of supplication. Intercession is not normally a one-off prayer. It requires persistence (Luke 11:5-8; Luke 18:1-5).</p>
<p>Gen 18:22-33 (Abraham); 1 Kings 18:41-46 (Elijah); 2 Kings 4:32-36 (Elisha); Acts 12:1-18 (The early church).</p>
<p>When we take it upon ourselves to pray earnestly for other people, we enter into the realm of intercession. To enter into intercession we must have a heart that really loves the Lord and cares about the things God cares about.</p>
<p>
There are two places in scriptures where the Bible mentions Jesus is still interceding for us since His departure from this world (Rom 8:34; Heb 7:25). <br
>He also prayed for us while on earth (John 17). When God calls you to intercede for others He is granting you the privilege to partake in a heavenly ministry that Christ is involved in. What a honour!</p>
<p>
There are millions of Christians worldwide who are quietly engaging in intercession for all kinds of things at one level or another. Are you one of them? Do not give up. Intercession it is a privilege that you should not take lightly.</p>
<h3>
Prayers
</h3>
<p><font size="+1">
The Prayer of Faith</font></p>
<p>
The prayer of faith, also known as petition prayer, is the prayer that most people think of when they use the term "prayer." Petition prayer is between you and God. It is you asking God for a particular outcome.</p>
<p>
The key verse for the prayer of faith is where Jesus says,<br> <font color= "blue">"Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them." (Mark 11:24)</font></p>
<p>
The rule to consider here is when you pray—not after you pray, not when you feel something, not when you see something. When you pray (the moment that you pray) you must believe that you receive what you asked for.
<br><font color= "blue">
"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen." Your faith is substance—it is something real, something tangible. It is evidence of things you cannot see. (Heb 11:1)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">
The Prayer of Agreement</font></p>
<p>
Jesus introduced the prayer of agreement when He said, "Again I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they ask, it will be done for them by My Father in heaven" (Matt 18:19).</p>
<p>
Right off the bat you can see that for the prayer of agreement to work, the people involved in the prayer have to agree! You cannot know what someone else wants—what someone is believing for—and God cannot answer your prayer for someone else against his or her will. To use the prayer of agreement, you must be sure that the person with whom you are agreeing is in line with what you are asking for.</p>
<p>
If someone asks me to pray in agreement with them, I ask, "What specifically do you want me to pray for?" You absolutely must make sure you are in perfect agreement about what your prayer request is before you join with another believer in the prayer of agreement.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
The Prayer of Dedication or Consecration</font></p>
<p> 
In Luke 22, we see outlined the prayer of consecration and dedication:<br> <font color= "blue">"And He was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw, and He knelt down and prayed, saying, "Father, if it is Your will, take this cup away from Me; nevertheless not My will, but Yours, be done." (Luke 22:41-42)</font><br>

He was praying, in effect, "If there is any other way to do this, let's do it that way." But the key for Jesus, and for us, is, "Nevertheless not My will, but Yours, be done."</p>
<p>
You pray that God's will would be done when you don't know His will or don't know if an alternative path that appears is equally "correct" or godly. <br>In the absence of direct instructions, the prayer of consecration and dedication says you will allow God to set your direction or make your decisions.<br>

The prayer of consecration and dedication works when you have two (or more) godly alternatives before you, and you are not getting a clear sense at that time about which option God wants you to take. When the direction is unclear—but any of the options appear to be legitimate, righteous options—that is the perfect time to say, "Lord, if it be Your will, I'm going to go with option A."<br>
Believe me, He will let you know if you are taking the wrong fork in the road.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
The Prayer of Thanksgiving</font></p>
<p>
Thanksgiving should be a regular part of our talking to God.<br> Thanksgiving is an all-inclusive act that involves praise, worship and honour of God.
God clearly spelled out His good and perfect will for us when He inspired the Apostle Paul to write:<br><font color= "blue"> "in everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you." <br>(1 Thess 5:18)</font> <br>Did you catch that? In everything. In the good times, as well as the bad. In the pleasantries of life, as well as in the pain. During difficult times, trying times and frustrating times, too. </p>
<h3>
Summary
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men, for kings and all who are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and reverence. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. (1 Tim 2:1-4)</font><br>
In practise we all use different types of prayer during our prayer times.<br>What may start out as a prayer of faith can soon develop into intercession with supplications. There is no reason why we cannot apply any of the above types of prayers to all the situations that face us.</p>
<p>
If any of the above types of prayers are absent in your life then you should seek God's face about it. Ask Him to fill you with more of His love and make your prayer life richer.</p>
