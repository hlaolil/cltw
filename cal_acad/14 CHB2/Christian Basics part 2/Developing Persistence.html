Developing Persistence
</h1>
<h3>
God Wants to Train Us in Persistent Faith
</h3>
<p>
Why is it that God does not give to us the things that we ask, the first time we ask? The answer is plain: He would do us the far greater good of training us in persistent faith.
The things we get by our other forms of effort than prayer do not always become ours the first time we make an effort to get them.</p>
<p>
For our own good God compels us to be persistent in our effort; just so, God does not always give us what we ask the first time we pray. Just as He would train us to be strong men and women along the other lines of effort, so also He would train us to be and make us to be strong men and women of prayer by compelling us to pray hard for the best things. He compels us to "pray through."</p>
<p>
Many today tell us we ought not pray for the same thing a second time. Sometimes they say the way to pray is to ask God for a thing and then "take it" by faith the first time we ask.
That is true, when we find a thing definitely promised in the Word, we can rest upon that. When we have prayed, knowing that we have asked according to God’s will, the prayer is heard, and we have received. Resting there, ask no more but claim the thing as ours.</p>
<p>
But that is only one side of the truth. The other side is, there are times when it is not made clear the first time, nor the second time, nor the third time, that what we ask is according to His will and, therefore, the prayer is heard and the thing asked granted. In such a case we are to pray on and on and on.</p>
<p>
While doubtless there are times when we are able through faith in the Word, or through the clear leading of the Holy Spirit, to claim a thing the first time we have asked of God, nevertheless, beyond a question there are other times when we must pray again and again and again for the same thing before we get our answer.</p>
<p>
Those who claim that they have gotten beyond praying twice for the same thing have either gotten beyond our Master, or else they have not gotten up to Him. We are told distinctly regarding Him: <font color= "blue">"So He left them, went away again, and prayed the third time, saying the same words." (Matt 26:44)</font> The truth is, they have not yet gotten up to the Master, not that they have gotten beyond Him.</p>
<h3>
It Is Spiritual Laziness and Unbelief to Give Up Too Soon
</h3>
<p>
There are many who, when they pray for a thing once or twice and do not get it, stop praying. They call it "submission to the will of God" to pray no longer when God does not grant their request at the first or second asking. They say, "Well, perhaps it is not God’s will." They call that submission to the will of God.</p>
<p>
But as a rule, this is not submission to His will, but spiritual laziness and lack of determination in that most all-important of all human lines of effort — prayer.
None of us ever think of calling it submission to the will of God when we give up after one or two efforts to obtain things by our lack of strength of character.</p>
<p>
When the strong man of action starts out to accomplish a thing, if he does not accomplish it the first, or the second, or the hundredth time, he keeps hammering away until he does. Just so when the strong man of prayer starts to pray for a thing, he keeps on praying until he prays it through and obtains what he seeks.</p>
<p>
How fond we are of calling bad things in our conduct by good names.<br> We call our spiritual inertia and laziness and indifference "submission to the will of God."
We should be very careful about what we ask from God; but when we do begin to pray for a thing, we must never give up until we get it, or until God definitely makes it very clear that it is not His will to give it.</p>
<p>
I am glad that the first time we ask, God does not always give us the things that we seek from Him. There is no more blessed training in prayer than that which comes through being compelled to ask again and again and again, even through a long period of years, before one obtains that which he seeks from God.<br> Then when it does come, what a sense we have that God really is and that He really does answer prayer!</p>
