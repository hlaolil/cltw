The Power of Prayer<br> Brings Health Benefits
</h1>
<p>
The time you learn to spend in prayer and meditation has a number of immediate health benefits.  Prayer lowers stress, decreases muscle tension, and provides a sense of peace.  Medical internist Larry Dossey and others have published extensively on the health benefits of prayer. <br> According to Herbert Benson, MD "between 50 to 90 percent of all diseases can be affected by patient belief."   A physical state of deep rest is experienced when you pray or meditate regularly, changing your physical and emotional responses to stress.  When you pray, you also have an immediate drop in blood pressure, heart rate, and levels of stress hormones.</p>
<p>  
Prayer unites our minds, bodies, and spirits.  The good news is that you don’t have to be a spiritual guru to pray.  Very simply, prayer is relinquishing your greatest concerns to the Maker of the Universe.  It’s time to honestly talk with God about your hopes, your fears, your desires and your needs. <br> It’s about communicating the reflections, emotions and attitudes that lie closest to your heart.  It’s through prayer that you begin to experience the difference between believing and knowing God. </p>
<p> 
Maybe you’ve never prayed before and wonder how to start.  On the other hand, you may have been praying for years but you want a deeper connection with God.  What can you do? <br> I appreciate John Ortnerg’s book The Life You’ve Always Wanted, and found it especially helpful.  With his inspiration, I suggest the following:</p>
<p>
1.) Establish a time for focused prayer and try to be consistent with it each day.  When you’re trying to establish a new behaviour it always helps to have a consistent routine until it becomes natural.  Choose a time when you’re at your best, not when you’re tired and exhausted.  Morning works best for me. </p>
<p> 
2.) Create an environment for prayer.  It’s helpful to have a peaceful, distraction-free environment that you can call your own.  It doesn’t have to be indoors; perhaps time during your morning or evening walk will work well for you. <br> Be creative, but consistent.</p>
<p>
3.) Slow down.  Before you pray, take a few moments to relax. <br> Take some deep breaths and help your mind and body to calm. </p>
<p>
4.) Start with small increments of time and increase the minutes as your comfort grows.  When you’re starting an exercise program you don’t go out the first week and run a marathon.  To develop a consistent prayer life, it’s helpful to start with a time frame that’s doable—maybe even 5 minutes or less. <br> Gradually increase your prayer time as your comfort level grows. <br> Its not the length of your prayers that matter—what matters most in developing a meaningful prayer life that is consistency and honesty.</p>
<p>
5.) Keep it simple.  Ortberg suggests that you “pray what’s on your heart, and not what you wish was on your heart  Ortberg states, “Prayer simply dies from efforts to pray about good things that honestly do not matter to us.  <br>The way to get a meaningful prayer is to start by praying for what you are truly interested in.”  Noble prayers won’t help you get any closer to God but honest ones will.</p>
<p>
6.) When your mind wanders, talk to God about what your mind is wandering on.  There are very few people who have the ability to stay focused on one thought without other thoughts drifting in.  Even in the morning, my mind is flooded with thoughts.  I used to feel discouraged that I wasn’t staying focused on “heavenly things”  But truly what drifts into my mind during those times is what I am most concerned about for that day.  These are the thoughts I’ve learned to talk to God about.  And my experience is more meaningful now that I do.</p>
<p>  
7.) Journal.  It may be easier for you to “talk” to God by writing. <br> You can follow these same tips should you choose to write.  There are a number of reasons why I think journalling is valuable, mainly because it forces you to slow way down and it brings perspective.  It’s always enlightening to go back a month or two in your writing (or sometimes even years) and review your circumstances.  You’ll see areas where you have grown, and continued opportunities for greater trust.  Writing down the answers to your prayers can also provide tangible reminders of how active God has been in your life. </p>
