<h1>
The Foremost Commandment 
</h1>
<h3>
The Foundation
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Jesus answered him, “The first of all the commandments is: ‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one! And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. (Mark 12:29-30)</font></p>
<p>
The primary command is given in the next verse where Jesus quotes Deut 6:5, but significantly, the Lord begins His answer with a quote from Deut 6:4. These two verses were part of what is called the Shema, a portion of Scripture quoted both morning and evening by devout Jews and worn in phylacteries on the arm and forehead by the Pharisees. Phylacteries were leather pouches containing four strips of parchment on which were written verses of Scripture.</p>
<p>
These verses were called “the Shema” because the first word of Deut 6:4, “hear,” is the Hebrew word shema, the imperative form of shama, “to hear and obey.” We might ask, why did the Lord begin here? I think it’s because this verse is so foundational to what follows, especially in the context of this confrontation with the religious hypocrisy and legalism of the scribes and Pharisees.</p>
<h3>
What does this verse teach us?
</h3>
<p>
Deut 6:4 (verse 4 of the Shema) pointed to the nature and divine essence of God to contrast Him with the many false god’s of the world. It not only marked out the God of the Old Testament, Yahweh, as the one and only true God, but it declared Him as the independent, sovereign God of the universe who had revealed Himself to the nation of Israel and redeemed them from slavery.</p>
<p>
First of all there is in this declaration the concept and reminder of the special revelation of God in all His majesty and divine sovereignty which Israel had received.</p>
<p>
Further, it reminded Israel of their special covenant relationship with this awesome God of revelation through His redemptive work on their behalf. <br>It reminded them of God’s love. He had given Himself to them in love, but this calls for an appropriate response from those He has loved.</p>
<p>
It also reminded them, as it reminds us, of the need to personally hear and respond to His Word. By this revelation we learn about our God, have fellowship with Him, stay focused on Him, and find the capacity to respond to Him in ways that demonstrate our worship and love and trust in His love and care <br>(cf. Deut 6:6f).</p>
<p>
In the process, this passage warns us about the rut of our religious rituals or routines. The Pharisees honoured these verses in the sense of lip service, but they ignored their truth.</p>
<p>
The point is that we can go to church, memorise Scripture, study the Bible, quote Scripture, know a lot about theology, even be involved in ministry, and yet, hold our hearts far away from any real relationship or commitment to God. When we do this, we are deceiving ourselves and our religion (our worship of God) is vain, meaningless hypocrisy (cf. Isa. 29:13; Mark 7:6-7).</p>
<h3>
Three Important Principles 
</h3>
<p>
(1) All true obedience and love for God depends on the right knowledge of God. No one will love God and keep His commandments who is not acquainted and occupied with God’s divine essence, His perfections, plan, and His sovereign right to command and direct our lives.</p>
<p>
It can be true for anyone in what they do, in what they trust for their happiness or security, in their values, priorities, pursuits, and actions as a whole.<br>To us it doesn’t seem quite so ridiculous, but it is to God. People in our “self-oriented” society run around in a frenzy of activity for their own pleasure, happiness or security, while they ignore their responsibilities to God, to family, to church, and to their country.</p>
<p>
(2) In the command, “Listen, Israel,” we are reminded of our need to carefully listen to the message of Scripture. For a loving, worshipful, and obedient response to God, we must be regularly and truly hearing and listening and experiencing intimate fellowship with the Lord through His Word <br>(cf. Deut. 32:46-47 with John 17:3).</p>
<p>
(3) The preservation of our joy in fellowship with God and love for God takes care and work. It is a constant fight with a call for diligence and alertness.<br> Why? First, because of our sinful nature and tendency to build our own cisterns, to walk by the dim light of our own firebrands, to lean on the arm of the flesh, and because of our proneness to wander. <br>A second reason is found in Satan’s constant activities to undermine daily dependence on the Lord rather than our own schemes to make life work <br>(cf. Deut 11:22; 19:9; Josh 22:5; 23:11 and the emphasis on being careful).</p>
<p>
It is therefore absolutely imperative that we live in God’s Word because of the nature of Scripture as God breathed and profitable for doctrine or teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction or training in righteousness <br>(2 Tim. 3:16). Because of the uniqueness of Scripture in its message and in its impact on lives, Dr Lewis Sperry Chafer use to say, “the Bible is not such a book that man would write if he could or could write if he would.”</p>
<p>
If the distinctions of classical Greek are still in force, then there is a suggestion here that the demonstration of God’s love is not something that natural man could have reasoned out, but is something which must be learned of by revelation. In other words, John is subtly yet powerfully telling us that the ultimate demonstration of God’s love is something that natural man cannot discover by himself. <br>Rather, he needs both the revelation of God’s love (in Scripture) and the illumination of the Holy Spirit in order to come to a saving faith.</p>
<h3>
The Fruit 
</h3>
<p>
The command to love God illustrates the truth that God’s special revelation demands an appropriate response, one in keeping with the character and essence of the God it reveals.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
(1) The Personal Emphasis</font></p>
<p> 
Literally, Mark 12:30 says, “you shall love the Lord your God.” This brings out the necessity of the personal element. Only through personal faith in Jesus Christ does God become one’s personal God. Then by the intimacy of a daily faith and walk with Christ, He becomes the Lord not merely known, but personally embraced in intimate fellowship.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
(2) The Nature of Love</font></p>
<p> “Love” is the verb <i>agapao</i>. This is a love of intelligence and purpose, of sacrifice and hard decisions. But to grasp this word as we should, it must be seen in contrast to the Greek <i>phileo</i> or <i>philia</i> which is more of an emotional kind of love, a mere liking or affection, a love which can be nothing more than sentimentality or a rosy glow created by some special environment. But that kind of love does not translate into hard decisions and actions that call for sacrifice.</p>
<p>
<i>Agapao</i> is a “wilful love, a determined love that generously chooses for the interests of another.” <i>Agapao</i> and <i>agape</i>, the noun form, speak of a love that grows out of knowledge. It comes from knowing the true God in all of His greatness and grace. You can’t work up <i>agape</i> by emotional fervour as so many people seek to do, and think by this that they love God.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
(3) The Source of this Love</font></p>
<p> The words “with all your ...” is literally “from the source of.” “With” is the Greek preposition <i> ek</i> which denotes origin, the point from which action or motions proceed. Love for God flows out of an inner life that is filled and controlled by a faith relationship with God through the knowledge of God and the ministry of the Holy Spirit (cf. Col 1:9 with Matt 12:34-35; 23:25-26).</p>
<p><font size="+1">
(3) The Extent of this Love</font></p>
<p> Note that the words “with all your heart, etc.” are not condensed as in “with all thy heart, soul, mind, and strength.” Instead, the words “with all” are repeated with each noun to place equal emphasis on each faculty that we are to use in loving God. Furthermore, the word “all” is the Greek <i>holos</i> from which we get the word, holistic. It means “whole, entire, complete.” This strongly stresses the fact that there can be no holding back or incompleteness in our devotion and commitment to God without serious repercussions on our capacity to love God and experience the life He has created us for. We simply cannot divide our love, our affections, or our trust.<br> The Lord put it like this: <font color= "blue">“No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and Mammon.” (Matt 6:24)</font></p>
<p>
Anything but a love for God that encompasses all of one’s being and every area of one’s life falls short of God’s will and our need if we are to be all that we were designed to be. Otherwise, we will be self-indulgent rather than choosing for God and others.</p>
<p>
But is there special significance in the use of each of the words: heart, soul, mind, and strength? The main emphasis is on their combined strength by which they stress the whole person, but may I make the following suggestions concerning these words as they are used here.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
“Heart”</font> would first of all bring out the concept of the inner person and that which is the centre of our life. Our relationship with God is central and paramount. God is no side issue or a once-a-week involvement. He is not like a dose of medicine. That kind of nod-to-God activity becomes mere religiosity which neither glorifies God nor results in the kind of wholesale changes we need as God’s representative people. Heart in this context, perhaps above all else, stresses the idea of our affections which ultimately determine our actions and pursuits (cf. Matt. 6:21-24). It means setting our affections on Him. <br>It means desiring God above all else as the deer pants at the water brook <br>(Psa 42:1). And oh, how we all fall short here!</p>
<p><font size="+1">
“Soul” </font>is often used to refer to the physical life and the self concept.<br> To love God with all our soul or life means to be willing to give one’s life to God and to devote it all to Him. It means total commitment. <br>In the word “soul,” we see the will choosing for God, giving one’s life to Him.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
“Mind”</font> refers to our ideas, viewpoint, and perspective of life. To love God with all our mind means to submit our minds, thought patterns, opinions, and decisions to God’s Word. It means to lean not on our own understanding but to bring every thought into obedience and captivity of the Saviour. <br>This means we act then not on what we think or on how we feel, but in accord with the facts of the Word of God.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
“Strength”</font> refers to all our abilities, talents, gifts, and physical powers. <br>All of these are to be surrendered and devoted to Him for His glory.<br> We are not to lean on our own strength, but we are to use our strength as we lean by faith on Him. Every fibre of our being, every aspect of our lives is to be caught up and focused on the majesty and essence of God and His matchless grace. He is to be the base and reason for our being and actions.</p>
<h3>
This means we need to recognise God as:
</h3>
<p>
Our Source—Our Derivation and reason for being.</p>
<p>
Our Force—Our Dynamic for life and means for living.</p>
<p>
Our Course—Our Direction and Destination for where we ought to be going.</p>
<p>
The chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy Him forever. The world has an insatiable longing. It seeks to satisfy itself on the leeks and melons of the world, but this leads only to a leanness of soul and an inability to love God and others. It’s a dog-eat-dog world. People seek happiness in scenic vacations, in pleasure, in accomplishments, in sports, and in human exploits of all sorts, but the longing and need that only God can fill remains empty like a hollow cave that is cold and damp. We were created for God and our hearts will remain restless with the result that we run around frantically in search of happiness, meaning, and purpose unless we find our rest and joy in the Lord.</p>
<p>
The Psalmist wisely wrote:<br>
<font color= "blue">
My soul, wait silently for God alone, for my expectation is from Him. He only is my rock and my salvation; He is my defence; I shall not be moved. In God is my salvation and my glory; the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God. Trust in Him at all times, you people; pour out your heart before Him; God is a refuge for us. Selah (Psa 62:5-8)</font>.</p>
<p>
Isaiah was so right when he said:<br>
<font color= "blue">
But the wicked are like the troubled sea, When it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt. “There is no peace,” says my God, “for the wicked” <br>(Isa 57:20-21)</font>.</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, this is not only true of the unbelieving world. It is true for a large portion of the Christian population.</p>
<p>
Let’s grasp the <i>Vision</i> of this passage and not let go! Certainly, God has given us all things to enjoy, but only as they are secondary to our love for Him and come under His control and direction. Otherwise, not only will we not be able to truly love Him, but we will be like the restless sea, unable to enjoy the life He gives us. In view of this, may I suggest four things:</p>
<p><font size="+1">
The Reality:</font></p>
<p> The simple reality is we all fall short in obedience and submission to God.
<p><font size="+1">
The Goal:</font></p>
<p> Loving God with our total person must become our desire and our goal or we will simply be playing church.
<p><font size="+1">
The Danger:</font></p>
<p> Knowing that we will always fall short must not become an excuse for apathy and business as usual.
<p><font size="+1">
The Need:</font></p>
<p> The need is concerned and broken hearts with a deep change of mind about what is paramount in our lives.</p>
