The Problem of Speculation
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
A man with an evil eye hastens after riches, and does not consider that poverty will come upon him. (Prov 28:22)</font></p>
<p>
It is actually a warning that the wealth acquired through unrighteous ways would   soon be squandered, but those assets acquired through good works would definitely be multiplied righteously. If lets say that the money in your possession is your salary, you would definitely think hard before spending it, especially on unimportant things, but if the money you are about to spend is just the reward money of any form of gambling (be it speculation, or gambling at a casino etc.), you probably wouldn't think too much about it. As they say easy come easy go!</p>
<p>
Another scenario is that when speculating or gambling if your "luck" runs out you stand to lose everything! This is when poverty will come upon you. 
<h3>
Discretion
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Discretion will preserve you, understanding will keep you” (Prov 2:11)</font>.</p>
<p>
Discretion is a plan for righteous living, a blueprint designed by God.<br> Discretion is always closely linked with wisdom. </p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“The proverbs of Solomon ...; To know wisdom and instruction; ... To give prudence to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion” <br>(Prov 1:1,2,4)</font>. </p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“When wisdom enters your heart, and knowledge is pleasant to your soul; Discretion will preserve you” (Prov 2:10,11)</font>.</p> 
<p><font color= "blue">
“My son, ... keep sound wisdom and discretion” (Prov 3:21)</font>.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and in all your getting, get understanding” (Prov 4:7)</font>. </p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Happy is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gains understanding. ... She is more precious than rubies: and all the things you may desire cannot compare with her. ... She is a tree of life to those who take hold of her, ... <br>The Lord by wisdom founded the earth;” (Prov 3:13,15,18,19, etc.)</font>. </p>
<p>
Proverbs description of wisdom clearly indicates that it is the wisdom of God that was personified when the <font color= "blue">“word became flesh, and dwelt among us” <br>(John 1:14)</font>. <br>It is, therefore, when we have come to the Lord Jesus Christ by faith and have been given the gift of His Holy Spirit that wisdom and discretion characterise our life.</p>
<p>
Discretion preserves us or hedges us about, but this plan for safety is not one we can engineer; it is in the hands of God. <font color= "blue">“He who keeps you will not slumber” (Psa 121:3)</font>.</p> 
<p><font color= "blue">
“The Lord shall preserve you from all evil;” (Psa 121:7)</font>. </p>
<p>
By faith, and in obedience to His word, we believe that His plan for us is one that assures we <font color= "blue">“may walk in the way of of goodness, and keep to the paths of righteousness” (Prov 2:20)</font>.</p> 
<h3>
Counsellors
</h3>
<p>
God indicates that your probability of success is greater with many advisers.</p>
<p><font color= "blue"> 
“For by wise counsel you will wage your own war, and in a multitude of counsellors there is safety.” (Prov 24:6)</font></p>
<p>
God recommends that we obtain biblical counsel from godly financial advisers.
The man without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him, and he cannot understand them, because they are spiritually discerned. </p>

<p><font color= "blue">The  Spirit of God makes judgements about all things, but He Himself is not subject to any man’s judgement. (1 Cor 2:14, 15)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the ungodly, (Psa 1:1)</font></p>
<p>
I have met some non-Christian financial advisers who do give good practical advice. However, if you want advice from a biblical perspective, which I believe is God’s will for every Christian, then you can get godly advice only from a godly financial adviser. For example, a non believer is simply not going to understand the desire in the believer’s heart for giving a significant portion of one’s income to God’s work. <br>The believer has an eternal perspective,<font color= "blue"> "Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth", ... "but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven” (Matt 6:19–21)</font></p>
<p>
In addition, a godly adviser would counsel you to use minimal debt. <br><font color= "blue">"the borrower is servant to the lender" (Prov 22:7)</font>. While many worldly advisers would encourage the use of a lot of debt, based on the belief that “smart people use other people’s money” or “buy now and pay later.”</p>
<p>
Therefore, before making any major financial decision, I recommend that you seek the advice of two or three godly financial advisers. In my view, an appropriate definition for such a person would be as follows: a spiritually mature Christian who understands and applies God’s financial principles (Psa 111:10), has a close personal relationship with God (John 15), has the necessary practical financial knowledge (Prov 24:3,4), and habitually puts the interests of clients first (Phil 2:3,4).</p>
<p>
I believe that one of your financial counsellors should be your spouse <br>(Gen 2:24), even if she or he has limited financial knowledge. God, through His Holy Spirit, can give His peace or lack of peace to an objective spouse who is not emotionally excited about or biased against a particular financial decision.</p>
<p>
After obtaining the counsel outlined above, it is your responsibility, to pray and ask God to give you his wisdom (James 1:5) in weighing the advice you have received.</p> 
<p><font color= "blue">
“The simple believes every word, but the prudent considers well his steps.” (Prov 14:15)</font></p>
<p>
In summary, before making any major financial decision, seek counsel from two or three godly financial advisers and from your spouse. Proceed only after you and your spouse have spent considerable time in prayer, and God has given you His peace and His wisdom.</p>
