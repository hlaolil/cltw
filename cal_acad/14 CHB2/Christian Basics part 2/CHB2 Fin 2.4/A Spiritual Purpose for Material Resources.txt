<h3>
Eternal Rewards
</h3>
<p>
One of the most commonly believed myths concerning the afterlife is the notion that, in Heaven, eternal life is our only reward. Everyone's rank will be equal in God's eyes. This monolithic view of Heaven has us spending a large portion of eternity sitting on clouds, strumming our harps and preening our new wings.
The Bible could not disagree more strongly with this definition of a communal Heaven. Paul, in Corinthians, said we will receive rewards according to the deeds we perform here on earth: <font color= "blue">"For we must all appear before the judgement seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad." (2 Cor 5:10)</font>.</p>
<p>
Paul also said in 1 Cor 3:13-15 that Jesus will test the quality of our works with fire. Our works that are unprofitable will be burnt up; our works that give glory to Him will remain. Obviously, if someone performed works during life on earth for his own glory, he will suffer heavy loss. On the other hand, the folks who work unselfishly to advance the Kingdom will suffer little loss.</p>
<p>
Jesus made it clear, in Luke 19, that each of us will receive different rewards for our service. In the story of the ten pounds, our Lord said, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a rich nobleman who gave his ten servants each a pound to invest while he was away on a journey. One servant generated a profit that was ten times his master's money, another servant made a five-fold return on the pound that was given him. The one who gained ten was made ruler over ten cities; the one who gained five was made ruler over five cities. The rest of the servants didn't make a profit on the nobleman's money.</p>
<p>
Paul related that man has very little understanding of the splendour that God is preparing for His faithful children: <font color= "blue">"Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for those who love Him" (1 Cor 2:9)</font>.</p>
<h3>
Eternal Wealth Is Not Always Obvious
</h3>
<p>
From our earthly vantage point, it is impossible to know exactly who is richer in the Kingdom of God. Jesus indicated from the example of the widow's two mites that what is in the giver's heart is more important than what is in the giver's hand. If one man had a million Rand to his name and he gave R1,000 to God's work, his gift would be dwarfed by a man who lived in poverty yet gave R20 to God.
Having a church which seats 10,000 people, a series of best-selling books, and a successful radio and TV outreach ministry might indicate that a pastor is building up great treasure in Heaven, but again, spiritual success can sometimes be hard to recognise.</p>
<p>
Consider the case of Robert Morrison, the first Protestant missionary to China. He sailed into the port of Canton in 1807 and laboured there 27 years until his death in 1834. During the entire span of Morrison's missionary career, he only baptised ten Chinese nationals. His pioneering work, which included a six-volume Chinese dictionary and a translation of the Bible, laid the foundation upon which other missionaries later built. The mind of man might perceive Morrison to be a complete failure, but God surely thinks otherwise.</p>
<h3>
God's Billionaires
</h3>
<p>
The world has its various rankings of wealthy individuals. Right now,Â± 1,000 people have achieved billionaire status. The Kingdom of God has its own roster of heavenly billionaires. The following list is just a small representation of some noteworthy people who have achieved spiritual greatness.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
King David </font></p>
<p>
God referred to David as a man after His own heart. David's historical legacy was his founding of the Judean dynasty. Most of David's greatest conquests were won on the battlefield. As a boy, he killed the godless giant, Goliath, with just one stone from his slingshot. David was God's greatest warrior, defeating the Philistines, Moabites, Aramaeans, Ammonites, Edomites, and Amalelekites. In both the Old Testament and the New Testament, the Messiah is referred to as the "Son of David." David is also credited with writing 73 of the Psalms.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
John the Baptist </font></p>
<p>
Gauging the amount of wealth John accumulated is not an easy task. John the Baptist did not write any books of the Bible, he had a very short-lived ministry, and even his life was abbreviated. Not until we read Jesus' comments about John do we learn that he was a man of great riches: <font color= "blue">"Assuredly, I say to you, among those born of women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist; but he who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he" (Matt 11:11)</font>.
<p><font size="+1">
Paul</font></p>
<p>
When polled, most Christians cite Paul as the man who has done the most to advance Christianity. This is an amazing designation for someone who initially tried to destroy the Church that is now so greatly indebted to him. If heavenly wealth were determined by deeds alone, Paul would have an overwhelming lead over his fellow heroes of the faith. Called the "apostle to the Gentiles," Paul probably holds the most patents in the field of missionary work. With the New Testament containing 13 letters bearing Paul's name as author, there can be no doubt of his mega-billionaire status in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Martin Luther </font></p>
<p>
Martin Luther made his fortune by setting the Reformation into motion. The grand opening event was held when Luther nailed his "Ninety-Five Theses" to the door of the Wittenberg Church. The document contained an attack on papal abuses and the sale of indulgences by church officials. He basically helped revive what has always been the heart of the Gospel - the doctrine that justification comes by faith alone. Luther became the father of a huge network of denominations that bear his name.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
John Bunyan </font></p>
<p>
Probably the greatest Christian fiction writer of all time, Bunyan is most noted for his book Pilgrim's Progress. It has been said that his famous allegory about Pilgrim on his journey to the Celestial City is second only to the Bible itself in the number of copies sold through the ages and throughout the world. Bunyan was jailed many times for preaching the Gospel without an official license. This turned out to be a blessing in disguise; Bunyan did some of his best writing in gaol.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
John Wesley </font></p>
<p>
Wesley was born June 17, 1703, in Epworth Rectory, England, the 15th of 19 children of Samuel and Susanna Wesley. Wesley was untiring and energetic in his efforts to advance the Gospel message. The Methodist movement was not an overnight success. Prosperity was only gained after a number of years, and amid some of the bitterest persecutions. In nearly every part of England, the proclaiming of the Gospel was first met by rock-throwing mobs. The name "Methodist" came from the business-like, organising power that the movement displayed. After Wesley's death, the Methodist Church grew into a huge denomination. Its success was guaranteed by military perfection instilled into its leadership by its founder.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Charles Wesley </font></p>
<p>
Some folks have described Charles Wesley as "the first Methodist." They point out that he first brought together a group of like-minded Christians to the "Holy Club" at Oxford. Leadership was not Charles' calling; he usually deferred executive matters to his brother John. Charles' main calling, and the source of much of his eternal wealth, was writing hundreds of hymns. You don't need to attend a Methodist service to hear them. Wesley's hymns have become standards in most Christian denominations.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Charles Haddon Spurgeon </font></p>
<p>
Spurgeon was England's best-known preacher for most of the second half of the nineteenth century. In 1854, just four years after his conversion, Spurgeon, then only 20, became pastor of London's famed New Park Street Church. His congregation grew so large that it had to move several times before finally settling in the Metropolitan Tabernacle. Spurgeon frequently preached to audiences of more than 10,000--all in the days before electronic amplification. Greatly blessed by the Holy Spirit, his success and worldwide popularity were due, in large measure, to a genius intellect, a natural gift of oratory, and thoroughly biblical expository messages. Spurgeon's many writings and brilliant sermons are still widely published today, testifying to his timeless appeal.</p>

William Booth</font></p>
<p>
During the 1800's, there must have been something special in Britain's water because here we have yet another native of England who founded a prosperous global Christian organisation. Booth was an evangelist in London, where he and his wife, Catherine Mumford Booth, established the movement that became known as the Salvation Army. It was originally founded under the name, "The Christian Mission," with the aim of addressing the evangelical and social-welfare needs of the inhabitants of the slums of London. In 1878, the Mission was reorganised along its present quasi-military lines and was renamed The Salvation Army. Today, Booth's organisation has become one of the largest charitable organisations in the world.</p>
<h3>
Infamous Financial Fiascos
</h3>
<p>
The financial world has experienced a number of infamous financial fiascos through the years, and the spiritual realm has seen several financial disasters of its own. Nothing is more tragic than someone having the opportunity to achieve eternal greatness and then losing it because of the person's own fraud or neglect.
<p><font size="+1">
Judas Iscariot</font></p>
<p> 
If anyone had the promise of great wealth, it was Judas Iscariot. The Bible says that the names of the 12 apostles would be inscribed into the 12 foundations of Heaven (Rev 21:14). Jesus said they would also sit on 12 thrones judging the nations of Israel. Judas saw the miracles and walked with Jesus all that time, but still somehow he failed to see the eternal riches that were being placed in his name. We all know he sold everything that could have been his for a meagre payment of 30 pieces of silver.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Pat Robertson and CBN</font></p>
<p> 
In the early 1980's, the Christian Broadcasting Network was one of the leading venues of Christian programming in the nation and the world. Pat Robertson was the founder of CBN, and everything was going fine until he got the idea of running for president of the United States. The American people were about as ready to elect a preacher to the highest office as they would have been to place an exotic dancer in that office. After losing big-time in the fall election, Robertson started a process that slowly transformed CBN into a worldly network. Bit-by-bit, nearly all Christian programming was replaced with shows that were secular in nature. When Robertson eventually decided to change the name of the network to The Family Channel, it was a logical move because little was left of CBN's Christian heritage. All hope was lost when Pat Robertson accepted a multi-million dollar buyout from Rupert Murdoch's Fox Broadcasting Company for the sale of The Family Channel.</p>

There are many more who have sold out for money and sin!</p>
<h3>
Being rich in Earthly or Eternal investment
</h3>
<p>
Unless you put money to some use, it really doesn't have any value. In fact, value is mostly created by the act of hoarding money. If everyone suddenly decided to sell all the stocks they own, wealth that is based on equity prices would instantly collapse. In the end, a rich person is not someone who has money; a rich person is someone who utilises money.</p>
<p>
To be a truly rich person in the eternal sense, you need to be investing your money in the Kingdom of God. In this area, people of earthly wealth fail miserably. One survey of people with R50 million or more in holdings found that only 2% of their money goes to religious charities. Wealthy celebrities rank even lower. One site that reviewed the tax returns of a number of well-known Hollywood personalities could not find one celebrity who gave money to a Gospel-minded organisation.</p>
<p>
When the rich finally do decide to give away a portion of their fortune, AIDS causes, libraries, secular colleges, museums, and medical research are some of the typical recipients of their donations. It's ironic that people can be wise enough to build up large sums of money through earthly investments, and they end up pouring those sums down a rat hole when it comes to eternal investments.</p>
<p>
Probably one of the best descriptions of what the afterlife will be like for men of great wealth can be found in Charles Dickens's classic A Christmas Carol. The torment of men like Jacob Marley, Scrooge's departed business partner, was not that he and others were weighted down with giant chains; their torment was that they could see the need in the world, but they could no longer "interfere, for good, in human matters."</p>
<p>
Jesus said,<font color= "blue"> "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God" (Matt 19:24). Simply because so few rich people give to the cause of Christ, someone who is well off could easily overcome the burden of wealth by giving to God. There is a factor I call the rich man's mite. If someone like Bill Gates decided to give a generous portion of his holdings to something like missionary work, even though he would have plenty of money left over, I believe that person could be regarded as giving in a measure equal to the widow of Mark 12:42.</p>
