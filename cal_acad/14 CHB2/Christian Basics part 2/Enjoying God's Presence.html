   <h1>
Enjoying God's Presence
</h1>
<p>
Due to Adam’s fall, God closed the way to the tree of life, and apparently throughout the ages people couldn’t eat of it ... but actually, if you read the Bible carefully you will notice that there have been many who were on the line of life and were enjoying the tree of life in their daily living!</p>
<p>
Through God’s promised redemption, the way to the tree of life had been opened to the people in the Old Testament, and through Christ’s opening the way to the tree of life we all now have access to the tree of life!
Most of the people who enjoyed God in both the Old and the New Testament did not really know this, but they lived a life of calling on the name of the Lord, walking with God, working with God, fighting God’s battles, living Christ, and enjoying Christ.</p>
<p>
We need to look at some of these patterns presented to us by the Bible to be encouraged, learn, aspire to, and pray for the Lord to make us such person on the line of life, those eating God as the tree of life.</p>
<h3>
The Line of Life Throughout the Scriptures
</h3>
<p>
We need to see the line of life throughout the Scriptures, from the very beginning all the way to the end. There are at least 19 cases of people who were on the line of life, who enjoyed the tree of life, and who spontaneously were in God’s presence and under God’s blessing.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Abel</font></p>
<p>
Abel contacted God in God’s way (Gen. 4:4). Abel didn’t assume (as his brother did) that he knew the way to worship God; rather, he contacted God all in God’s way, and he put aside his opinion, thought, and personal concepts.<br> Whenever we contact God through Jesus Christ, by offering Christ as the perfect sacrifice and by enjoying Christ as the tree of life, we eat of the tree of life and partake of God as our life!</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Seth and Enoch</font></p>
<p>
Seth and Enoch called upon the name of the Lord (Gen. 4:26). They realised that they are frail and mortal, and they began to call on the name of the Lord. They not only prayed – they called on the Lord’s name audibly and desperately! A very simple way to enjoy the tree of life is to call on the name of the Lord! Just be simple: depend on the Lord by calling on His name!</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Enoch walked with God</font></p>
<p> 
The Bible doesn’t tell that Enoch worked for God or did many great things for God – he simply loved God and walked with Him until he was not, because God took him! <br>(For the last 300 years of his life, Enoch walked with God Gen. 5:22,24). <br>He simply loved being in God’s presence, enjoyed being with God, and walked with God in his daily living, until God raptured him!</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Noah</font></p>
<p>
Noah walked with God and worked together with God (Gen. 6:9, 13-14). <br>Noah went further than Enoch: he not only walked with God but also received a vision from God concerning what He wants to do, and then he worked together with God to build the ark. <br>In our daily walk with the Lord we need to walk with God and be open to Him to see His desire, His mind, and His will, and then serve God according to His desire (not our own desire) and His thought (not our own thought).</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Abraham</font></p>
<p>
Abraham lived in the appearing of God and called upon the name of the Lord (Acts 7:2; Gen. 12:7-8; 17:1; 18:1). He wasn’t a super-spiritual person – he was just like us, but the God of glory kept appearing to him!<br> When God appeared to him, Abraham was infused with faith and lived by faith in God. He called on the name of the Lord, built altars (consecration), and lived in a tent (for God’s interest). With his up and downs, Abraham walked according to the appearing of God.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Isaac and Jacob</font></p>
<p>
Isaac and Jacob lived in the appearing of God and called upon the name of the Lord (Gen. 26:2, 24-25; 35:1, 9; 48:3). Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob all had a very similar experience – they all called on the name of the Lord, followed Him wherever He wanted them to go, enjoyed the good land promised to them by God, and lived a life of the altar and the tent for God’s glory. This is the reason that God is called the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob – three generations enjoying God as the tree of life.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Moses</font></p>
<p>
Moses lived in the appearing and the presence of God <br>(Acts 7:30; Ex 3:2, 16; 33:11, 13-15; 34:29; 25:9).<br> After some failures, Moses learned to cease  doing things according to his natural knowledge, his own way, and his own energy, and he lived in God’s appearing, His constant presence. After God appeared to him in the wilderness in the burning bush, Moses lived in God’s presence and depended on His constant leading. God’s presence was everything to him in his walk and work for the Lord. On the mountaintop Moses experienced a full enjoyment of God as the tree of life, being infused with God’s glory to shine out God.<br>
The children of Israel journeyed in the presence of the Lord. <br>(Ex 13:21-22; Num 14:14). Some people may look at the people of Israel’s journey through the wilderness and may see only their failures, but they were in God’s presence, they journeyed with God, and God took care of them by being everything to them. They enjoyed God as the tree of life again and again until they were constituted with God. They travelled in God’s presence and enjoyed God.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Joshua</font></p>
<p>
Joshua lived and worked in the presence of the Lord (Josh 1:5-9). <br>Joshua started as a young man carrying out God’s desire as uttered through Moses, and when he was appointed as a leader over Israel he continually depended on God, living and working in God’s presence. </p>
<p><font size="+1">
Gideon</font></p>
<p>
Gideon fought the battle in the presence of the Lord (Judg 6:12,16). <br>Gideon started as a shy young man, but once God called him and infused him with faith, he fought God’s battles in the presence of the Lord. He ate God as the tree of life and continually depended on God. </p>
<p><font size="+1">
Samuel</font></p>
<p>
Samuel prayed and called upon the name of the Lord. <br>(1 Sam 12:23; 15:11; Psa 99:6; Jer 15:1).<br> From his childhood, Samuel heard God speaking, prayed, and called on the name of the Lord, and he enjoyed God as the tree of life all the time.<br> He never sinned against the king by ceasing to pray for him. He was a man of life living on the line of life, enjoying God. </p>
<p><font size="+1">
David</font></p>
<p>
David trusted in God, looked to God, and enjoyed God as life <br>(1 Sam 17:37,45; 30:6; Psa 27:4,8,14; 36:8-9).<br> David’s secret was that he desired to dwell in the house of God continually, so that he may behold God’s beauty. He enjoyed God’s presence, respected God’s choice, acknowledged God’s will, and enjoyed God. Even though he failed, he always repented and returned to the Lord, seeking His forgiveness. He realised that with God there’s the fountain of life. He really enjoyed God as the tree of life. </p>
<p><font size="+1">
Daniel</font></p>
<p>
Daniel prayed to God constantly and contacted Him continually.<br> (Dan 6:10-11; 9:2-4; 10:1-3, 12).<br> Even from a young age he refused to eat the king’s food and drink, and he enjoyed God very much. He didn’t trust in his own intelligence but rather was a man of prayer, depending on God constantly, and praying to Him at least three time daily. Daniel ate of God as the tree of life by contacting Him daily and continually. </p>
<p><font size="+1">
Jesus</font></p>
<p>
Jesus as the Son of God lived by God (John 5:19; 6:57; 14:10).<br> The Lord Jesus is Himself the tree of life, and at the same time He depended on God the Father as His life and life-supply. He didn’t do anything according to His way, for Himself, for His purpose, or for His glory – He always lived, walked, and worked according to the Father who was in Him. He completely depended on God as life, worked for God, gave God the glory, and did everything by depending on God. </p>
<p><font size="+1">
New Testament believers</font></p>
<p>
The New Testament believers live by the Lord and enjoy the Lord.<br> (John 15:5; 6:57; 14:19; 6:35; 15:11; 16:24; 17:13; 1 John 1:4). <br>Today we as believers in Christ need to stay on the line of life by enjoying God as our life and our life supply. When we enjoy God as the tree of life, our daily life, work, and walk will be for the building up of the church. The more we enjoy the tree of life, the more we do things in ourselves, by ourselves, and for ourselves, and the more we will be one with the Lord and live, act, work, and walk in Him. </p>
<p><font size="+1">
Paul</font></p>
<p>
Paul lived out the Lord (Gal 2:20; Phil 1:19-21a). The Apostle Paul was a pattern of living out Christ for His magnification whether in good or not-so-good situations he was in. For Paul, to live was Christ, and to die was gain. He was fully one with Christ, doing everything in the index of His eyes and striving to pursue Christ so that he might gain Him. Paul ate God as the tree of life and he lived out Christ for God’s glory. </p>
<p><font size="+1">
The Church</font></p>
<p>
The church as the Body of Christ lives by Christ as life (Eph 1:22-23; Col 3:4). In the church Christ is our life and our living, and He is everything to us for the building up of His Body. Today the church is God’s expression in a corporate way by all the members of the Body eating Christ as the tree of life and living by Christ as their life. </p>
<p><font size="+1">
The New Jerusalem</font></p>
<p>
The New Jerusalem is sustained by the river of water of life with the tree of life (Rev 22:1-2). At the end of the Bible we see that all those on the line of life will consummate in the New Jerusalem, the city of life. In this city the constant supply is God in Christ as the Spirit flowing as a river of water of life and Christ as the tree of life available for all to eat and enjoy. Our destiny as God’s people is to continually depend on Christ as the tree of life for eternity!</p>
<p>
Lord, we choose You as the tree of life as our constant supply for our Christian life and church life. We praise You that we can choose life! Make us persons of life, believers who constantly enjoy God as the tree of life. We depend on You as our life and we want to take You in as the tree of life all the time. Keep us on the line of life! Gain so many who reject the tree of knowledge of good and evil and choose You as life. Lord, life is all we need. Keep us enjoying You as life today!</p>
