Working Mothers
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
they admonish the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, to be discreet, chaste, home makers, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be blasphemed. (Titus 2:4-5)</font></p>
<p>
The maternal employment debate rages on between those who believe that mothers are happier and more fulfilled when they take on both the roles of a parent and that of a career woman, and those who argue for the child and the effects on the family unit and development of the child if the mother cannot focus her full attention on her family because she is working.
The effects on the well-being of the family may be a highly contentious issue that raises the blood pressure of many in the education sector, but the reality is that many households cannot survive on a single income. The patriarchal stereotype that the mother is the caregiver and household manager while the father is the breadwinner applies less than ever.</p>
<p>
The number of mothers that are being employed is on the rise. The question is what has been the effect of this increase on the economies around the world and here in South Africa?
In many First-World countries a long period of maternity leave is offered to enable better care during the initial developmental phases of a child’s life where bonding with the mother is paramount. In emerging market economies it is more likely that mothers go back to work comparatively early on in the child’s life. There is an element of necessity to this practice, but what must also be considered is the need of women to pursue their own career growth prospects and to take the opportunity to climb the corporate ladder that was once denied to them.
Although barriers still exist, women are holding more influential positions in business than ever before. Their contribution to today’s economy is undeniable, from the increased financial input that results in better schooling and academic performance
of the school-going child to the amount of single parent headed households where the mother serves as the only role model for developing children.</p>
<p>
A study conducted in Denmark suggested that mothers who work for a period of 15 years or more from the first three years of their child’s life onward have increased access  to social support from the
business that they are working for as well as government
support. Coupled with this are improvements in mental well-being and access to higher quality childcare and educational institutions.</p>
<p>
The South African economy does not seem to benefit as much as it could from the skills that working mothers offer. The inflexible time and location options open to women who have family responsibilities make it difficult for a working mother to fulfil both roles adequately, but nevertheless there is a contribution that the working mother is making towards the economy that is more prevalent today than it was half a century ago.</p>
<h3>
Economically speaking
</h3>
<p>
Michelle Hatch, a lecturer in economics and finance at the University of KwaZulu-Natal School of Accounting, focuses most of her research on the economics surrounding single, married and working
mothers. “Labour market research shows that although there has been a feminisation of the labour force in post-apartheid SA, women are still considerably less likely to participate in the labour force
than men,” she says.
The disparity between the earnings of men and women in the SA labour market persists as well.
Research shows that part of the reason for the persistence of gender inequality is that much of the rise in female employment is associated with work in sectors that are characterised by lower earnings and job instability.</p>
<h3>
The emotional challenges
</h3>
<p>
For mothers to return to work and give up their role as primary caregivers during working hours comes with a heavy emotional toll.
When speaking to working mothers, it is evident that guilt and regret are the predominant feelings associated with the decision to return to work after the birth of their children.
On the one hand, there’s the guilt that working mothers have that they don’t spend enough time with their children while on the other hand, the fear of not being able to give their child the best if they didn’t work. Most mothers also feel guilty about having to leave
a young child in day care the whole day, but there really is not enough time to get everything done in a day.</p>
<p>
A working mom works three, sometimes four shifts in one day. There’s the morning shift at home, the working shift, the late afternoon, the early-evening shift and then the after-the-children go-to-bed shift – which means time that she needs to be dedicated to the upkeep of the marriage.”
Weekends are the busiest because it’s soccer for the boys and ballet for the girls. Not to mention the financial costs of these activities. It’s a constant sapping of time and energy.
This results in many working mothers struggling with fatigue, and can manifest itself as frustration that can be taken out on the significant other in the lives of the mother or on the children. This in turn increases the guilt that the working mother is already
struggling to deal with.</p>
<h3>
The upside to a career
</h3>
<p>
The picture is not all gloomy, and working mothers do experience job satisfaction. The pros are many. One of them is that in this
challenging economic environment women can be proud that they contribute to the finances, thereby easing the burden on the household. Bonds, school fees, car repayments and day-to-day living costs make it incredibly hard to survive on one income. The cost, of course, is that they sacrifice time with their children, which is
contrary to how women were raised. On the work front, women are competing in a male-driven environment, and need to work hard to prove themselves, often to their own detriment.
They have to put in longer hours and battle to juggle work and life in balance.</p>
<h3>
Much criticism is levelled at working mothers.
</h3>
<p>
Spouses often criticise their wives for not making enough time for themselves and the children; traditional families criticise them for not following the typical model in which the mother stays at home to raise the child. </p>
<p> 
With a diminished talent pool within South Africa and a severe skills shortage, many companies are reaching out to employ skilled, experienced women who have been on sabbatical during their child-raising years. These companies recognise the immediate benefits of trading flexible work arrangements for dedicated, hard-working, experienced employees who are immediate assets and bottom line contributors to their organisations, and for the most part are low risk human capital investments. To these employers, results matter, hours don’t.</p>
<h3>
Where is the balance?
</h3>
<p>
A mother should not have to choose between formal work and having a family.
Mothers need to believe in themselves, and know that they are valuable assets to an organisation. They have no need to apologise for the fact that they work flexibly or part-time. If a woman has
been out of the workplace for a number of years, she may however need to up-skill or re-skill. Technology moves at a rapid pace.   Special discounts have been sourced for mothers returning to work to
enable them to do courses in computer use, social media, accounting software, Excel or many others to enable them to be ready to re-enter the market.</p>
<p>
There are trainers who specialise in transitional coaching for mothers wanting to return to work.
Women need to think practically about the impact that going back to work will have on them and their families. The busiest women are
those who choose to work part-time and be a hands on mom the rest of the time. Women need to look at ways to simplify their lives, such as on line shopping, lift clubs for children and outsourcing what they can.</p>
<p>
Mothers should use technology to help them integrate. If an early morning meeting is scheduled, arrange that one can call into the meeting rather than miss it. Block out times in electronic diaries
when one needs to be with the family.
Mothers may have to seek out forward-thinking employers that offer time-wise employment opportunities or mom-friendly hours,especially if the mother is the breadwinner. But there is no compromise
when it comes to matching employers with talented and skilled individuals.</p>
<p> 
A flexible, balanced work life is not just a requirement of working mothers but an opportunity for people who believe in themselves to get the work opportunities they
deserve.”</p>
