Praying for Results
</h1>
<p>
I firmly believe the reason why many Christians do not experience victory is because they lack an important foundational key to success—prayer. <br>Contrary to common religious beliefs, prayer is not pleading with God or bargaining with Him to act on our behalf. Neither is it characterised by a lot of “spiritual” sounding clichés that do not line up with the Word. <br>Prayer is simply communicating with God by speaking His Word to Him in faith.<br> When we pray this way, results are inevitable. </p>
<p>
Heb 4 clearly describes the power of that Word.<br> It says, <font color= "blue">“For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.” (Heb 4:12)</font> 
Believers are encouraged to <font color= "blue">“hold fast our confession.” (Heb 4:14)</font> <br> In other words, speak God’s Word, because it is power-packed! When we pray, believing that we have already received what we are praying, God has no choice but to make our prayers come to pass. He honours His Word, not our emotions. </p>
<p>
Prayer should produce rest, or peace of mind. Many people pray fear-based prayers and hope they are getting through to God, but they really don’t have confidence in what they are praying. The Bible says that when we believe the Word, we will enter into a state of rest. The integrity of the Word speaks for itself, and will never fail. By allowing the Word to be the foundation of our prayer life, our confidence in our prayers will soar to new heights.<br> We must know in our “knower” that Scripture is infallible, and have no doubt that what God says is true and that we already possess it. I urge you to begin to pray the solution to your problems first, rather than bombard heaven with desperate pleas.</p> 
<p>
Prayer is the language through which you and the Father fellowship with one another. It is through your dialogue with Him that your faith to believe His promises through Jesus Christ will come to pass. As you spend time with Him in prayer, you will begin to recognise His voice more clearly. He desires to direct you at every turn, and a developed prayer life will make it easier for Him to guide you. </p>
<p>
Every failure in life is a prayer failure. God has already done everything He is going to do; the work has already been completed. Our job is to pray faith-filled prayers that are based on His Word and expect to receive results.<br> Make no mistake about it; prayer is absolutely essential to our walking in the manifestation of God’s promises. It is a key to getting results as a Christian. <br>Our prayers are heard. When we make the Word of God the foundation of our prayer life, we are guaranteed victory. We must not allow religion or tradition to blind us to the truth of what prayer really is. Your future depends on it! </p>
