<h1>
Faith, Confidence, Commitment and Patience 
</h1>
<p>
The world’s system is limited, which is why God doesn’t want us operating in it. The kingdom of God, on the other hand, has no limitations, as long as we operate by faith. Faith is the law of the kingdom. Therefore, we must completely understand what faith really is in order to successfully use it.</p>
 <h3>
What is faith (from our perspective)? 
</h3>
<p> 
Faith is a practical expression of the confidence we have in God and His Word (Heb 11:1-9). 
Confidence is defined as full trust; belief in the ability of a person or a thing.
Confidence is a level of commitment that must be demonstrated.
Our confidence is the key element in our walk of faith. 
God is not a respecter of persons, but He is a respecter of faith.
Faith comes by hearing and hearing the Word of God. Therefore, faith and the Word are one.
“Do not, therefore, fling away your fearless confidence, for it carries a great and glorious compensation of reward” (Heb 10:35).
When we stop having confidence in the Word, we stop the manifestation we desire from it.
Our confidence is developed over a period of time.
Our commitment to our confidence also requires development.   
Satan attacks our confidence because he doesn’t want us to believe that the Word works.
Many times, when trouble comes our way, it is Satan’s attack on our confidence.  
Therefore, we need steadfast patience and endurance to continue in our confidence (Heb 10:36).Faith, Confidence, Commitment and Patience

True biblical patience is being consistently the same concerning our stance on the Word, no matter what is happening.  
When our confidence in the Word is attacked, we must employ patience.
When we allow our patience to work during trials, we refuse to doubt, regardless of the circumstances.
For example, you may be confessing, “By Jesus’ stripes I am healed!”
You must continue confessing and building your confidence in that Word, even when you feel sick.  
Feelings, bleak circumstances, and bad reports are indications of whether the Word is working or not.
The Word always works. However, we must maintain our confidence in the Word to see results. </p>
