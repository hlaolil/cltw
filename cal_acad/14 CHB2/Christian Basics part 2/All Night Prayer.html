All Night Prayer
</h1>
<p>
There is a release of God's power in an uncommon way like whenever God's servants in the scripture were led to pray all night.</p>  
<h3>
Jacob
</h3>
<p>
Let's first look at the life of Jacob.  Jacob's experience indicates the passion and the power of all night prayer.  In the middle of the night, Jacob being alone, shared his fears before God in prayer.  While praying, One in the likeness of a man wrestled with him and Jacob became determined that he was going to win.  He was determined that before he left this time of all night prayer, he was going to get his blessing.</p>
<p>
In Gen 32:26 Jacob said to the Angel I am not going to let you go until you declare a blessing on me.  Nothing requires more vigour and unceasing exertion than wrestling.  Those who would have the blessing of Christ, must resolve to not take no for an answer. The fervent prayer is the effectual prayer.  From Jacob's all night prayer experience we discover that a blessing is guaranteed if you are persistent, energetic and determined.  You will walk away from an all night prayer experience with a blessing.  An all night prayer experience is not a time to struggle to stay awake, an all night prayer experience is a time to fight for the victory and the blessing.</p>
<h3>
Jesus
</h3>
<p>
The next all night prayer experience we want to look at is that of Jesus. <br>Luke 6:12 says Jesus prayed the whole night.  What is more significant to note is what Jesus did after the all night prayer. <br> He selected His ministry team, the 12 apostles, He then healed a multitude that had diseases and were tormented by unclean spirits.  The power that was unleashed in Him after praying all night was so potent - every need He came in contact with after that all night session of prayer was met!  Immediately after healing the great multitude, the impact of His all night prayer session could still be experienced.  Then He preached one of His most powerful messages - <br>The Sermon on the Mount. </p> <p>You would think after praying all night, healing a multitude of sick people and then preaching a powerful message that the power He received from all night prayer would have been used up but after He concluded His message Luke 7 says He entered Capernaum and healed the Centurion's servant.  The next day the power was still active because He raised the son of the Widow of Nain and then in Luke 8 He began preaching in every city and village.  The results of His all night prayer were phenomenal.  All night prayer produces incredible power.</p>
<h3>
Paul and Silas
</h3>
<p>
Another example of the power all night prayer was from the Apostle Paul and his travelling partner Silas in Acts 16:25.  The prayer of praise was offered up in the midnight hour, while they were in the middle of a mess, about a supernatural deliverance.  Praise directed toward God in the middle of the night shook open prison doors.  A man was converted, his household saved, and satanic captivity overthrown in Philippi all because of the midnight prayer of praise.</p>
<p>
All night prayer is not something that is comfortable to your flesh.  Successful all night prayer takes a made up mind, a determined will, a willingness to sacrifice sleep, a heart of expectation, a belief in the power of God, the character of God and the willingness and desire of God.  If you will bring these key ingredients into all night prayer - God will meet you, transform you and your circumstances, and you are going to see a demonstration of the power of God like never before. </p>
