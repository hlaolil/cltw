Consider Jesus Christ
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
“For consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners against Himself, lest you become weary and discouraged in your souls.” (Heb 12:3)</font></p>
<p>
The word that is used here for “consider” means to think over carefully. It requires time and effort. This is not to be a fleeting consideration of Jesus. We live in a world on the move. If you don’t keep up you will be left behind or out of touch. Frankly, I quite like the idea of being out of touch with the world—it’s biblical. Heb 12:2 instructs us to look to Jesus as the example of one who “endured the cross” and accomplished the will of God. In the same way, we are to <font color= "blue">“run with endurance the race that is set before us” (Heb 12:1)</font> as we patiently wage war against sin. It’s the end result that we are to consider. In Heb 12:2, the end result is that Jesus is seated at the right hand of God. We must run our race in our struggle with sin by looking to Jesus.</p>
<h3>
Who is Jesus Christ
</h3>
<p>
Heb 12 follows on the heels of the great faith chapter (Heb 11). We have all these examples of men and women who lived by faith. They are given for our encouragement and instruction. We, too, are to walk and live by faith. This is what is referred to when it says that <font color= "blue">“we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses.” (Heb 12:1)</font> We have witnesses behind us and we have Jesus before us. Our Lord Jesus Christ is the supreme example of one who lived in complete dependence and trust in God. The epistle to the Hebrews is about the superiority of Jesus. Jesus is superior to angels, because He has a better name and He is God (Heb 1:1–2:18). Jesus is superior to Moses, to Joshua and to Aaron. He is not like a Moses who was servant. Jesus is the Son. He’s not like Joshua—He offers and provides a better rest. He’s not like Aaron, because He is a priest after the order of Melchizedek, and as our high priest He offers a better sacrifice and represents a better covenant (Heb 3:1–10:18). He is completely superior to all these. He is superior in His person and work.</p>
<p>
The writer to the Hebrews is concerned that his readers will go back to what they were before, under the old covenant. That would be a despising of Jesus’ work. From Heb 10:19–12:29, the writer urges his readers to press on in faith. He calls them to endurance. They must not shrink back and they must not grow weary (Heb 10:26–39; 12:3–17). On the positive side, they must draw near (Heb 10:19–25). Jesus goes before them. He is their leader, their apostle, their high priest and their redeemer. He is the founder and perfecter of their faith (Heb 12:2).</p>
<h3>
Our Practical Help
</h3>
<p>
But how do all these biblical truths translate into practical help for us? </p>
<p><font size="+1">
First</font></p>
<p>
Considering Jesus must be seen as the answer to not abandoning the faith, as some were thinking of doing. They thought Judaism was far more beautiful with its temple, its sacrificial system and its priesthood. You could see these things. You could smell them and touch them. They were tangible and visible. We are always seduced by what we see. We feel confident when we have some sort of control over things. It’s hard to be like that when we cannot see Jesus, when there is no more temple because He’s now the temple; when there’s no more priesthood on earth because He’s our priest in heaven; when there’s no more sacrifice on earth to assure us that our sins are forgiven because He is now in heaven. This invisible spiritual aspect makes us think that it’s not real. But the Scripture assures us that all earthly things were but shadows and copies. They were not the real thing. Christ is the substance. This is where faith comes in. We are called to believe the truth and the promises of God. We can believe the truth because the God who spoke the truth has revealed to us exactly who He is. We can trust the revelation that God has given because God is reliable. There is absolutely nothing in Scripture to indicate that God will fail in keeping His Word. He cannot fail because He is God. He must, therefore, be believed and trusted.</p>

Second</font></p>
<p> Considering Jesus must be a contemplation of Christ in His person and work and what He has accomplished. The entire epistle to the Hebrews is about this. The reason Jesus “endured from sinners such hostility against himself” was not that we might just have nice thoughts of thankfulness for what he did for us, but rather that we might not become weary and discouraged in our souls. How utterly practical that is! My perseverance is grounded in the suffering of Jesus. He did not give up. He did not fall away. He endured for me.</p>
<p>
Perseverance is one of those massive biblical truths you never hear about or don’t pay attention to. We much prefer thinking about eternal security, but the end can never be achieved or gained without suffering and hardship. We have this natural human penchant for “take thine ease.” Jesus endured so that I would not become weary and discouraged in my soul. None of us have shed our blood as Jesus shed his (Heb 12:4). Certainly some have given their lives for Christ, and in some measure they enter into this aspect of Jesus’ suffering, but that wasn’t the case with the Hebrews yet.</p>
<p>
To “become weary” means to fall ill or sick and thus be worn out. Have you ever felt like that? You cannot do anything. Your body is in pain and your brain is in denial. You get weaker and you start to give up. You lose motivation. This is the temptation that all suffering and affliction brings (let alone physical pain). You see, none of us have ever suffered like our Lord, yet He persevered and endured. Therefore, He encourages us with His example. To be “weary and discouraged” means to dry up or to be withered. The Greek text uses the word for “soul”that is translated “mind” or “heart.” This is a spiritual barrenness, a spiritual withering away. This begins to happen when you give up Bible reading, praying, or gathering with God’s people. A soul withering sounds like a  frightening thing. If we are honest with ourselves, we all will confess to this incredible struggle that we are engaged in. We do not wage war against flesh and blood, but against spiritual enemies (Eph 6:12). Our warfare is spiritual in nature. It requires spiritual weapons. The physical sufferings of our Lord are shocking enough, but the spiritual sufferings are beyond comprehension. Our Lord endured that we might press on and be spiritually vibrant in the contest. We are to “run the race that is set before us.” It is our race to run. We run with Jesus because He has gone before. So consider Him who endured, the writer says.</p>

Third</font></p>
<p> Considering Jesus in this way strengthens my assurance or confidence. Not only my assurance in the faith, but also in Christ Himself. I don’t believe an ideal. I believe in and on the Lord Jesus Christ. Good ideals will fly out of the window at the first sound and sight of trouble. If Christ overcame and conquered, so can I. Do not the saints conquer by the blood of the Lamb? (Rev 12:11). Eight times in the book of Revelation, Jesus refers to the “one who conquers” (Rev 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21, 21:7). Each time He promises them various blessings and privileges. To conquer means to be a victor, an overcomer. Finally, considering Jesus proves our sonship. The fruit of the New Covenant is that we are sons and daughters of God. Here is a massive encouragement to press on. It will prove in the end that I belong to Christ. Keeping on in Jesus is keeping on in faith. Faith looks beyond the visible to Him who is invisible. It is the conviction of things not seen (Heb 11:1). Without faith, we cannot please God (Heb 11:6). Let us consider Jesus every day, every minute. Let us consider what He endured and what He now enjoys. For if we endure, we shall enjoy Him in the life to come for we shall be His.</p>
