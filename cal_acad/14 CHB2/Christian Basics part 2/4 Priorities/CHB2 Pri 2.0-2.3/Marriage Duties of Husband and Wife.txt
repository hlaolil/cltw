<h1>
Marriage Duties of Husband and Wife
</h1>
<h2>
The Husband's Duty
</h2>
<p>
If you are a man and are married, or are betrothed (engaged to be married), or hope one day to be, the scripture has some things to say to you. Today I want to look at the five duties of a man to his woman. The five duties of a husband to his wife. And I don't care what anybody else has told you, if the husband fails to fulfil these five duties, he has forsaken the Lord and His sacred rules which He has ordained.</p>
<p>
I'm not here to castigate you. I'm here to speak to us. To encourage us to be scriptural husbands. Now I must warn you some of the things that the scripture says won't be what you hear at your workplace, or on television, or from your friends. But then, neither should they be; because your workplace didn't create marriage, neither did the media nor your friends. This is our Father's institution and He sets the rules.</p>
<h3>
Love Her
</h3>
<p>
The first duty of a man to his woman, or a husband to his wife, is to love (Greek word agape) her. Now, you might say, "Well, that goes without saying! Move on to number two!" Your wife probably wants me to stay at number one. Because, often, what goes under the name of love has little to do with love. The word 'love' has become a misunderstood word. For example, people say, "I love my job. I love my home. I love chocolate cake." Generally what they are talking about is what those things do for them. "The home makes me comfortable. The cake satisfies my sweet tooth. The work satisfies my desire for a career." The word 'love' has become a word to describe the lusts of the flesh, and nothing more.</p>
<p>
You see, when the scripture talks about love, it talks about the sacrifice that you make for the betterment of someone else. You can only measure love by your sacrifice, not by your enjoyment. If you talk about loving your wife, and you mean by that that she does a lot of good things for you, that's not love. That's her loving you. To say that a man loves his wife is to talk about the sacrifice that you make for her.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Husbands, love your own wives, even as also the Christ loved the assembly, and gave up himself for it;" (Eph 5:25)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Husbands, love your wives, and do not be bitter against them." (Col 3:19)</font> </p>
<p>
Men, to talk about love is to talk about a cross. To talk about love is to talk about Calvary. To talk about love is to talk about a Saviour. We have a Saviour in Christ, and our wives ought to have a Saviour in us. We have a deliverer in Christ, and our mates ought to have a deliverer in us. When you talk about loving your wife you talk about carrying a cross.</p>
<p>
Now, you may say, "I know. But this cross is more than I can bear!" The command for a man to love his wife is never given to a woman in scripture. That is, a woman is never commanded to love her (agape) husband in the scripture. She is commanded to be affectionate (philandros) to him and their children (Titus 2:4), and to be obedient (show respect) to him (Titus 2:5). Now, it's not that a woman shouldn't love her husband, it is that her love is a response to his salvation. If you and I are going to be scriptural lovers, it means we must become scriptural saviours.</p>
<p>
Jesus Christ didn't die for us because we were lovable; Jesus Christ died for us to make us lovable. A man doesn't love his wife because she deserves to be loved; a man loves his wife in order to turn her into somebody who he wants to love. It is not that "My wife is right, therefore I'm going to love her." It is, "I'm going to love her that whatever wrong there is will turn from wrong to right." It is not that "She's meeting my needs therefore I love her." it is, "I'm going to love her until she learns to meet my needs." It is not that "She's being everything to me I need her to be." It is that, "I'm going to love her until she turns into somebody who can be everything that I need."</p>
<p>
Most men date in order to marry, when the scriptural principle is to marry in order to date. Most men "turn her on" in order to get her to say "I do." Well, the scriptural idea is have her say "I do" so that he can spend the rest of his life turning her on. If you want to raise the question "Are you a lover" (and every man likes to think of himself as a lover), the measuring rod of a lover can only be measured by the size of the cross he's carrying.</p>
<p>
Husbands, love your wives like Christ loved the church. He loved the church to death! When the first man was created, God had to split his side open in order to take out his rib in order to get Eve. Christ has to bleed in order to birth His congregation. And in order for your wife to move from where she is, in order to get to where she ought to be, that means you have to take a trip to Calvary. That means you'll have to decide "I am willing to pay whatever price of inconvenience. I am willing to commit myself to her fulfilment no matter what pain is involved in that. I am willing to go the distance to turn her from where she is into where she ought to be.</p>
<p>
The scripture says Jacob loved Rachel so much that he worked fourteen years in order to gain permission to marry her from her father (Gen 29). That's a high price to pay, but it's the price of true love. There are men that want to run away from their wives because they are not lovable. If she was lovable she wouldn't need a Saviour. Only sinners need saviours!</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us." (Rom 5:8)</font></p>
<p>
Christ looked out and said, "You're messed up. You're going nowhere. You're headed in the wrong direction, but you do have a Saviour. When a man comes home, he comes home and says, "Things may not be right. I may not be able to adjust to your personality. I may not like how you come across. But a Saviour is in the house! I am your deliverer! Whatever is wrong, I am Mister fix-it. Whatever price has to be paid, you're looking at him! I am going to be your Saviour!" The husband is the Saviour of the wife. And at the heart of that is sacrifice. If there is no sacrifice there is no love.</p>
<p>
So the question to the husband is, "Do you really love your wife?" And if so, if I asked her what price are you paying, could she tell them? Could you show what price you are paying for her? Or do you say, "Well, I'm discouraged, I'm depressed." Are you still alive? Because if you're alive you've not paid the ultimate price. As long as you are breathing you have not paid the total price. Because a man is to love his wife as Christ loved the church, and that took Him to His grave!</p>
<p>
Now, you may be saying, "That's next!" But until a man has paid the ultimate price of death, he is not exonerated from love. That is why the preacher asks you up front, "Are you going to love her in sickness and in health? For better or for worse? For richer or poorer? Are you going to do this for as long as you both shall live?" Because preachers know something you may not know. They know you haven't seen the whole thing yet. And when you do, they want an up front commitment that you're going to stick it out. So your wife ought to hear from you, "No matter how you treat me I'm not going to leave you. No matter how you abuse me I'm not going to leave you. No matter how you speak to me I'm not going to leave you. You better get used to salvation because this Saviour isn't going anywhere. So, if this marriage ends you're going to have to leave me! Cause I'm not going anywhere. If you don't comfort me I'm not going anywhere. If you don't have sex with me I'm still not going anywhere. If you abuse me and mistreat me, I want to let you know, in this house, you have a Saviour. And that's me."</p>
<p>
If you're not living like that, you're not loving. Not only must you be a Saviour, but you must be a sanctifier.</p>
<h3>
Sanctify Her
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"That he might sanctify it, having cleansed it by the washing of water by the Word, That he might present it to himself the glorious assembly, not having spot, or wrinkle, or any of such thing; but that it might be holy and blameless." (Eph 5:26-27)</font></p>
<p>
Now there is a the "problem" that a husband faces. When you married your wife, you did not only marry your wife, you married her history. You see, you didn't just marry her. You thought you were marrying her, but she brought with her her past, good and bad. The good parts you will enjoy, the bad parts you don't see until after the honeymoon! You get to see her with make up on; you get to see her with lipstick on; you get to see her with eyelashes that you thought were real; and you get tricked is what you get! And after marriage you discover something. You discover that, "I didn't know you were like that! And I didn't know you were a fusser! You didn't fuss when we were dating! I didn't know that you screamed like that! I didn't know you snored like that! I didn't know that you couldn't cook at all! I didn't know all of that!"</p>
<p>
Guess what? If you love her, you have to be her sanctifier. What's a sanctifier? The word "sanctification" means "to set apart for special use." That is, to place this woman in a unique category and take her from where she is to where she needs to go. It is called in the scripture the process of sanctification or spiritual growth. When she shows you her problems, you now become Mister fix-it. That's what it means to love. What many men want to do is marry as though they're at the end of the relationship, when you get married you're only at the beginning of the relationship. And your job is to take it from where it is to where it ought to go because you are the sanctifier. You are little Jesus in your home. What Christ is to His assembly you are to your wife. You are the sanctifier. So that if she's messed up, your job is to fix it up.</p>
<p>
Now, what happens in some marriages is this. It's like a backup in a sink. You know when your sink backs up because there's a lot of junk in there, there's a lot of stuff in there that can go hidden for a while but it kind of builds up. Then when it builds up it backs up. And husband's get kicked off because all this junk starts backing up. "I didn't know you had that dirt over there! I didn't know you had this clog over there!" It was there all the time, it just hadn't backed up yet. When that starts backing up and all of a sudden the sink gets full of this dirt, this grime, you don't say, "I'm going to leave you kitchen, because you backed up on me! I'm not going to have anything to do with you again, sink!" You call the plumber! And when you call the plumber he brings the snake! And he takes the snake and he works that thing around and around until he opens up a little hole. And when he opens up a little hole the water slowly begins to drain, and he opens it up bigger and bigger until all the junk is flushed out!</p>
<p>
When junk backs up you don't quit, you bring in a pro. And you are that pro. And when your wife backs up, when her history backs up, when the pressure at work backs up, when circumstances back up, you're not to leave, you're to come in with the love snake and wind that thing around and turn that thing around and make a little hole there and the watch all of that junk begin to filter out of her life until it flushes all away and you can now have free flowing running water. Bring the love snake and work that thing. You are her sanctifier. Why? So that you can cleanse her. Eph 5:26 says you're her cleaner upper, so cleanse her.</p>
<p>
Heaven knows she's got some things that are not going to be pleasant to live with; things from her past, things from her history. Maybe she was abused by her father, maybe she was raised around a domineering mother that didn't disappear just because you came on the scene. You are the sanctifier.</p>
<p>
But what some husbands do is, when they see this junk come up and it backs up, they want to run the other way! You're the plumber, bring the snake "That he might present it to himself the glorious assembly, not having spot, or wrinkle." Spot means defilement from the external; something dropped on your shirt and you've got a spot. Wrinkle has to do with internal ageing, because wrinkles are evident of an internal problem, getting old. God's children have spots, the external things of the world; and wrinkles, internal decay from within.</p>
<p>
Jesus said his job was to wash the spots and remove the ageing. He says the husband is the sanctifier and the husband's job is to work with his wife in such a way that she begins to see a clean up take place in her life. When she needs strength, you are her strength. When she needs encouragement, you are her encouragement. When she needs joy, you are her joy. When she needs peace, you are her peace. So that no matter how old she gets, she's kept eternally young because she's got a sanctifier in the house. You are her make up. When the world crashes in on her, you are there. You are to be her power base. You are to be her strength. When she goes off, you are the ever standard one who maintains his cool even though she lost hers. You say, "Well, if she didn't scream at me, I wouldn't have screamed at her!" This is not tit for tat. What this is is showing strength. You say you're the leader, you're the strong one, you say you're the powerful one, then be that! Be her sanctifier that she might be cleansed, so that Christ might present to himself a bride not having spot or wrinkle. The idea here is to nourish.</p>
<p>
So, first of all, if you're going to love her, you must be her Saviour, you must be her sanctifier. And then, the third part of love is you've got to nourish her.
<h3>
Nourish Her
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"So husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies, he that loves his wife loves himself. For no one ever hated his own flesh; but nourishes and cherishes it, just as the Lord does the church." (Eph 5:28-29)</font></p>
<p>
What we need today are a group of men who know how to nourish and satisfy a woman. Now, the natural man thinks of sex when he hears that. "Bring it on! I am the satisfier. Come here baby! Papa will satisfy you! Yes I will!" Any man who talks that way doesn't know what he's talking about. He's really trying to convince himself that he is as good as he says he is. Because any man who talks about satisfying multiple women is really telling you he's not good enough to satisfy one. So he's got to spread it around so nobody calls him to commitment. When a man says, "I've got ten ladies!" What he's telling you is that he hasn't reached to manhood yet, because anybody can bounce around. It's when you stand steady, and after fifteen, twenty, thirty, fifty years, the wife says, "I'm still satisfied," now you've got a real man. When that one man is constantly nourishing and satisfying her.</p>
<p>
The scripture says that husbands ought to "love their wives as their own bodies." The spirit here is that Christ gives himself to his assembly, and just as a man works out to make his body look good, he is to work his wife out so that she looks good. So that she is fulfilled. So that she is strong. You are her satisfier. And there are too many dissatisfied wives because there are too many unsatisfied husbands. If you're not satisfying her, if you're not her joy, then you better take a look at how good you really are.</p>
<p>
It has nothing to do with what she's doing to you in return, because we're talking about scriptural love. “And if you hate me, I'm going to love you. And if you reject me , I'm still going to try to please you. Because I am here to feed and nourish you. Because I am your satisfier!"</p>
<h3>
Dwell with Her
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge, with the wife as with a weaker vessel, rendering them honour, as also being joint-heirs of the grace of life; so as your prayers not to be cut off." (1 Peter 3:7)</font></p>
<p>
Husbands are commanded to dwell with their wives. This doesn't mean to just live in the same house. The Greek word for “dwell” means "to dwell in close harmony with, closely aligned, to be in proximity with." It means an intimate dwelling. Many men have this idea, “I go out, I'm the provider; you're the wife, you stay home. You do your job, I'll do my job.” That's where the problem is. The home is your job! The role of the wife is to help the husband, but she is not to replace your role in the home. You are to work in concert with her to create a spirit of harmony within. To do that you must be there.</p>
<p>
Your wife didn't marry a pay check, she married you. She didn't marry a car, she married you. She didn't marry a bankroll, she married you. Whenever the outside things that you do for her replace your presence with her, then you are not living with her any more. Some men are married to their jobs, to their promotions, but God says to live with her! You can't just come home and turn on the TV, you have to come home and work with her! Sometimes it means telling her she's the prettiest thing you've ever run into. Or that you couldn't get your mind off of her all day. Sometimes it means drying the dishes while she washes them. Sometimes it means making one side of the bed while she makes the other. Why? because she was not given to you to become your slave, she was given to you to be your help partner.</p>
<p>
Men are told to study two things. The scripture and his wife. Why? Because both are difficult to interpret. Those are hard things to read. Every man will testify that a woman is confusing, complex. You think she wants this but she really wants that. To know her might mean to give up some television programs. Men should say, “Honey, I want to listen, you talk. Tell me anything about yourself that I need to know, because when I learn it I'm going to use it to love you better. Teach me, because I don't know you, I don't understand you. I'm not going to watch TV and listen. I'm not going to read the paper and listen. I'll put my eyeball to your eyeball, my mind to your mind, because I'm here to listen, I'm here to learn, I'm here to understand if you'll only communicate with me.” Women love to be understood. And many women have said, “My husband doesn't understand me,” and she's probably right. But it takes time, you've got to be willing to listen to her.</p>
<h3>
Honour Her
</h3>
<p>
You are to treat her like your queen. She is not another woman. It has to do with appreciating her, with treating her as special. Does your wife feel special? Many husbands do for other women what they wouldn't do for their own wives. We used to do it. They used to open up the car door every single time, now she's looking to get in before the car drives off! When love dies, marriage dies. She is your queen, and you roll out the red carpet, and pull out the chair, and open the door, and help escort her in.</p>
<p>
She must feel special. How do you make her feel special? By your words and actions from the heart. “Sweetheart, I'm real busy right now, I'm right in the middle of something, but you crossed my mind and I just wanted to call and tell you I love you and I can't wait to see you when I get home. I gotta run now, but you're on my mind.” She's going to beat you home! Because you just made her feel special. That took 30 seconds to tell her you can't get her off your mind.</p>
<p>
You also make her feel special with your gifts. It doesn't have to be a dozen roses, one rose will do. Writing little notes to her. When she's making the bed and underneath the pillow is a note that says, “Knowing that every night I get to sleep next to you. Knowing that I wake up in the sunshine, even if the curtains are closed. I just want to let you know I wouldn't have it any other way." She's special. She's unique. Make breakfast and bring it to her. She doesn't care that you can't cook, only that you cared enough to try. This is honouring her.</p>
<p>
If we only do this on anniversaries and such, this is too predictable. When you were dating you didn't only do it on the anniversary, it would pop up here and there. It would keep popping up. She was bombarded with your love. First of all she didn't like you, she didn't think you were handsome. But you said, “I'm going to make you like me.” And you bombarded her with notes, gifts, phone calls. In time, she began to say, “Why, he ain't that ugly.” And you kept bombarding her, and she began to say, “He's kind of cute.” And you kept bombarding her, and she calls up her girlfriend and says, “I'm in love!”</p>
<p>
What happened? What happened is that you honoured her. But what too many husbands do is stop honouring their wives once they get married. She fends for herself. When was the last date? I'm not talking about the last time you came home and said, “What do you want to do tonight?” That's not a date. A date is, “Hey, I got this thing all planned, all you got to do is come along for the ride. Now, if you want to make some adjustments, that's fine, because I want to please you. But I want you to know I was thinking about you." Now it's not about you coming home, and having nothing to do, and saying, “What do you want to do?” Have the attitude that, “You are not left over, you are my evening!” She must be honoured.</p>
<p>
Honouring doesn't mean that you agree with her, it doesn't mean that your decision is going to be the decision she wants you to have, We're not talking about control. But to honour her means, “Honey, I've got to make the decision, and I appreciate your feedback. You've given me your thoughts, your ideas, because you're a partner in this relationship and I need to know how you feel about it. And before I make this decision, you give me your feedback because God may be giving you some things that I need to hear. But having heard what you said, I think I've got go another way. But I want to let you know that even though I'm going a way different than how you would have me go, I'm going to be thinking about you all the way. And if I see down the line that this is not going to be in your best interest, I'm going to reverse. Because I don't want to do anything in my decision that's going to harm you. So even though I disagree with you, I'll honour you, because you're going to be on my mind all the way.”

It's where she's significant even when you disagree. If husbands would treat their wives like thoroughbreds, they wouldn't end up with old nags. Men say, “She's a nag!” But maybe it's because how you're treating her. Men say, “I married the wrong woman!” Well, if you married the wrong woman, treat her like the right woman and she'll become the right woman.
<h3>
Pray with Her
</h3>
<p>
If there is no spiritual relationship in the home, there won't be any dynamic relationship in the marriage. 1 Peter 3:7 says you are heirs together. That means God is not going to leave anything for you if she is not included. Your prayers are a waste of time if she's not included. You don't have this singular relationship with God any more because you became "one flesh." God is not going to treat you apart from her, because He doesn't see two people any more, He sees one flesh. Husbands must pray with their wives.

Husbands, you're the thermostat, you control the temperature. Your wife is the thermometer, she'll tell you how it reads. So if you have it on 80, and she's cold, the thermometer's broken. You can usually measure a man by looking into the face of his wife, because she is his mirror, letting it be known what kind of man he really is.

The question is not, “Will marriage work?” The question is, “Will you work for marriage?”</p>
<h2>
The Wife's Duties
</h2>
<p>
There are two people that can come together to become one flesh; a husband and a wife. Wedlock is an office ordained by God, a Holy union, wherein the husband serves the wife and the wife the husband. The worst thing a man can do is marry the wrong woman.
<font color= "blue">"A continual dripping on a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike;" (Prov 27:15)</font>
Nothing can be more miserable than having to spend every day of your life with an evil woman.</p>
<p>
What does it mean to be a godly woman? If you are married, this is what you must strive to be. If you are not married this is what you must orientate yourself to be. The duties of the wife can really be narrowed down to two things. The first duty that a good wife must fulfil is help her man.</p>
<h3>
Help the Man
</h3>
<p>
In the beginning, Almighty God made Adam,  <font color= "blue">"And the Lord God said, “It is not good that man should be alone; I will make him a helper comparable to him." (Gen 2:18)</font>
God made someone to come alongside of him, co-responding to him, to work with him, to accomplish the Divine goal that God has given man. The duty of a good wife, who wants to see a strong marriage and family, is to be the counterpart to her mate in such a way that that which God has given the both of them, she must be by his side as his helper. She is not just some extra on the side, she is an indispensable part of His Divine plan.</p>
<p>
One of the causes why so many men are miserable and why so many marriages fail is because the woman is not out to help him, she's using the marriage to help herself. She has a faulty view of the relationship. Instead of being his partner and coming alongside to increase their relationship with God, she becomes a part of the opposition, not cooperating with God's agenda for the family, but using it as a launching pad for her own purposes. And when a woman loses site that God's first expectation of her in relationship to her husband is to be his helper, then a negative atmosphere is created in the household that is difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>
So the question is, “What does a helper look like?” Now, the assumption, ladies, is that if God expects you to help your man, the understanding is your man needs help! Admittedly, men are not complete in and of themselves. That's the purpose God created women. So, if you are finding fault with your man, he needs help; and guess who the helper is. If you are saying, “My man is messed up!” Guess who the helper is. You cannot complain that he is not what he ought to be if you're not fulfilling your role as the helper! God made you the helper because man desperately needs help. He desperately needs someone to come alongside who will be different than him, in order to complete him, thereby fulfilling the Divine plan of God.</p>
<p>
So, whenever the faults of your husband shows up, there are opportunities for you to fulfil your scriptural duty; not simply to fuss and cuss about how messed up he is, but to analyse the kind of helper God has called you to be. In fact, if you are the complete opposite of your husband, wonderful! That means you can fill in all the blank spots where he needs help. That's not an opportunity for disgust, but an opportunity for godly assistance. You are the one to help mould and shape him into the man that God ultimately wants him to be in order to carry out the agenda of the household.</p>
<p>
The description of a prolific helpmate is:
<font color= "blue">"Who can find a virtuous wife? for her worth is far above rubies." (Prov 31:10)</font></p>
<p>
Many ladies have a low view of themselves which make them a weak wife. When you look at yourself as a priceless diamond, as you are in God's eyes, then you'll act accordingly. If you only look at yourself as substitute jewellery, you're going to live as one. It could be made to look like the real thing, but it's not. Prov 31:10 is talking about the real woman, not a plastic woman. Not a woman that's so made up you don't know what the real thing looks like, but an authentic woman. And scripture says when a man finds this kind of woman, a true and authentic wife, he's got a piece of jewellery that's very valuable. And what's the hallmark of this woman?</p>
<p>
“For she employs all her living for her husbands good.” (Proverbs 31:12)
She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life. Now if your husband was asked what good are you to him, would he have an answer? Can he measure how you are constantly, perpetually, determinately looking out for his good? Can he raise the point, if asked the question, that every time this wife wakes up she is thinking about how to make him a better man? And if that is not your number one agenda item, you are not a godly wife. You may be a bed partner, you may be a cook, you may be this and you may be that, but a good wife seeks the good of her husband all the days of his life. That is, just as he is loving and honouring and cherishing you, you are to wake up and ask, “What good can I be to him today?”</p>
<h3>
Help him In and Out of the House
</h3>
<p>
One of the first ways she helps him is around the house.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“She seeks wool and flax, and willingly works with her hands. She is like the merchant ships, she brings her food from afar.” (Prov 31:13-14)</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“She considers a field and buys it; from her profits she plants a vineyard.” (Prov 31:16)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“She makes linen garments and sells them, ...” (Prov 31:24)</font></p>
<p>
There is a warped view among some "Christians" that if you're a Christian woman you sit home and throw your college education in the garbage. That there is no productivity, no skill. But the Prov 31 woman is one who is skilled, she saves money, uses money, and spends money wisely. But she's doing this to the good of her husband. This is not like modern women who are building their own career with their own money with their own bank account and they write their own checks. That's not the godly woman. Because a godly woman, while she uses those skills, always brings it back home for the embellishment of the home and the enhancement of her husband. There is no monetary competition.</p>
<p>
And if you love your career so much that your husband is never benefiting from the career that you love, then you're not a godly wife. You bought the lie that you're your own woman, you do your own thing, and that man is your inconvenience. That is a lie! The feminism movement is born from satanic rebellion against the Holy God. But because many women have established their own bank accounts, and spend their own money for their own agenda, and the good of the husband is nowhere to be found, then the blessings of God will not rest on your life or be in your household. Your godly home will become a godless home.</p>
<p>
When you begin to live your married life with no thought of the betterment of your husband, you have joined the adversary in dissolving your marriage. God did not give you a husband for you to still be an independent single woman. He gave you a husband so that you could partner with him, helping him by using your gifts, your skills, and your abilities that He has blessed you with, for the betterment of the whole household. Whenever your career demands of you that which negates your duty as wife and mother, you're in the wrong career, and it is not a calling from God.</p>
<p>
The Prov 31 woman uses her abilities, she does not throw them away. She also helps him parentally.</p>
<h3>
Help him Parentally
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“She also rises while it is yet night, and provides food for her household, ...” (Prov 31:15)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“She is not afraid of snow for her household, for all her household is clothed with scarlet.” (Prov 31:21)</font></p>
<p>
In other words, she assists the husband by helping with the children; it is not her duty alone. The husband's duty is to manage the household, but the wife's duty is to help him. She is not to replace him, but she is to help him. And here we have a woman who's so committed, so dedicated, that she wakes up early before everyone else to make sure that all the bases are covered.</p>
<p>
Now, why does God ask the woman to prioritise the household? Because one of her duties is to raise the next generation of godly seed. And if you have to leave the house so much that you cannot assist your husband in a significant way, as a parent and guardian of the children, then you're not fulfilling what God has told you to do. That's why the aged women <font color= "blue">"... that they admonish the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, to be discreet, chaste, home makers, good, obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be blasphemed." (Titus 2:4-5)</font>.<br> 
That's why <font color= "blue">"... the younger widows marry, bear children, manage the house," (1 Tim 5:14)</font>.</p>
<p>
Never let the outside pull of the world keep you from being a dynamic wife and mother. Never let the schedule outside dictate the schedule inside. She also helps him personally.</p>
<h3>
Help him Personally
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“She strongly girds her loins, and strengthens her arms for work.” (Prov 31:17)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“She makes for her husband clothes of double texture, and garments for herself of fine linen and scarlet.” (Prov 31:22)</font></p>
<p>
This woman is looking good! She takes care of herself. We're not talking about some haggard woman here. This man is excited to go to his house. This woman also helps him ministerially.</p
<h3>
Help him Ministerially
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“She extends her hand to the poor, yes, she reaches out her hands to the needy.” (Prov 31:20)</font> </p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“She opens her mouth with wisdom, and on her tongue is the law of kindness.” (Prov 31:26)</font></p>
<p>
She's serving the poor and counselling others. So she's come alongside his ministry, she's a partner with him, sharing her wisdom with others. She doesn't have time to gossip, she's spending too much time devoted to her husband. She doesn't have time to spend all day in front of a soap opera, because she has a man that she has to make look good. And how good is this man?</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“The heart of her husband safely trusts her ...” (Prov 31:11)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Her husband is known in the gates, when he sits among the elders of the land.” (Prov 31:23)</font></p>
<p>
Everybody knows who this man is because of this woman. Why? Because his lady made certain it was that way. Other people know him because she makes him look good.

Now, I know what you're saying. “What about me?! I don't always want to be in the background! I don't always want to be hidden! I don't always want to be making some man look good! I want to look good! I want people to talk about me! ” Well, if you seek recognition, this is the way it should come about:
<font color= "blue">
Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her:” (Prov 31:28)</font><br>
The husband should praise her, and teach his children to praise her. He should teach the children well, so they say, “Thank you, Mom, that on cold days I'm warm. Thank you, Mom, that on cold days I have hot food.” When you have a woman like this you should talk about her all day long. You should say, “Thank you. Can't live without you. I need you. I enjoy you.” All the people you meet should know how good your wife is. Go public with this woman, don't keep her in the background! There's no privacy here. The wife is to make her husband look good, and the husband is to take his wife public with him.</p>
<h3>
Submit to your Man
</h3>
<p>
The second thing a woman must do is reverence her husband.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Nevertheless let each one of you in particular so love his own wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband." (Eph 5:33)</font></p>
<p>
Eph 5:22-24 explains the doctrine of submission. The word “submission” is a good word, but because people have defined it wrongly, you look at it and say, “Oh, not that word!” Why is it a good word? Because Jesus submitted himself to the will of the Father.</p>
<p>
First of all, submission has nothing to do with equality. Submission has to do with accomplishing God's purpose. Jesus submitted to the Father in order to accomplish salvation. He did it for His Father's purpose, never questioning whether it was "fair" or not. It had nothing to do with whether they were equal. 1 Peter 3:7 says a husband and wife are “joint heirs,” and therefore equal and are to be treated as equals. To submit to your husband does not mean that you are a door mat. It doesn't mean that you are to be pressed on, beaten on, or any such thing. You are equal to any man in the eyes of God. But when it comes to His purpose for you, submission is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>
To submit to your husband does not mean you agree with him on everything, it means you recognise his position as head of the household to accomplish God's purposes as it relates to the family. You may say, “I can't submit to that man. Preposterous!” You may not agree with everything Mr. Jones at your job tells you, but you submit. If you're in court you may not like what the judge thinks, but you submit. We see that these examples do not have to do with submitting to a man, but submitting to a position.</p>
<p>
God has called your husband to a position. His position is head over the household. That's not as a dictator and it's not as "boss man." The job of the head is to give direction to the body. The duty of the wife is to willingly place all of her strengths under the authority of the husband to follow him as he follows Christ. That's why it says (and here's some good news for you ladies):</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands, as unto the Lord." (Eph 5:22) </font>
So you don't have to worry about him abusing you. When he leaves the Lord he is no longer in the position as your head, he no longer qualifies as the head, for he has abandoned it. That is, you are never to disobey the Lord in order to follow your husband, because your greater allegiance is to the Lord.</p>
<p>
But if this man is trying to serve the Lord, don't work against him. He may not be doing it right, or perfectly, but if the man is trying to please the Lord don't work against him. Why? Because he needs a helper, not a hurter. He needs assistance, not a hindrance. He needs somebody to come alongside and smooth all those rough edges, so every woman should say to her husband, beginning today, “You are my leader. God has put you as head of the household. I am going to honour you as head of the household. I am going to follow you as head of the household. I'll only ask you, darling, for one thing. Don't lead me away from Christ, because if you lead me away from Christ I'm going to have to leave you and go with my first love. I don't want to leave you and go with my first love, so you follow my first love so I can follow both of you.”</p>
<p>
That's the idea! That he follow Christ and you follow him. But ladies, he needs to hear that from you. He needs to hear that you are going to honour and reverence his position as head of the household. If you can submit to a boss you don't like, then you can submit to a husband you don't like. Because it's not about liking the husband, it's about obeying the Lord. A lot of women say, “I can't submit!” Well, how do you know? You've never tried! “I can't follow!” How do you know?! He told you one thing that was wrong and now you won't listen to anything.</p>
<p>
Many women have never told their husband that they are willing to come under his authority as he follows Christ to lead the household and motivate him to follow Christ. Rather they work against him by fussing at him, griping at him, and complaining that he never does anything right. It's like after he gets beaten up outside the household all day long, now he's gotta come home to be beaten up some more. He ought to come home to somebody that will love him, hug him, caress him, affirm him, strengthen him, dignify him, and to a woman who's going to recognize that he may not be anybody down town, but "he's somebody in this house, and I'm going to make sure he's somebody!"</p>
<p>
If your attitude is, “My man is no good,” maybe he's no good because nobody's helping him. Maybe that's why. Maybe God gave you to him to fix up the rough points and you never caught the message.</p>
<p>
That's what headship is. Jesus submitted to the Father, the husband submits to Jesus, the wife submits to the husband using all her gifts and strengths for the betterment of the household. A wife who does not submit herself to her husband has not submitted to God, so don't tell anyone how spiritual you are. You can "go to church" every week, but if your husband does not know that you recognise his position as head then you are a carnal woman. You can read your bible every day, have devotions, go to bible study every Wednesdays, and still be out of the will of God if you don't honour your husband.</p>
<p>
For some wives, their husband may not know how to be a good husband because he was not raised with a good father; has perhaps never seen a godly husband. Not knowing what a godly husband is, he will therefore have to learn. It may take some time, and these wives may have to humble themselves and say, “Father. I have sinned in this area. I have not been a helper, I've been a hurter. I confess that I've sinned, and today I'm going to tell my husband that he now has a helper. Someone who's going to work with him, not against him. Someone who's going to support him, not crucify him.</p>
<p>
So, what are you to do? Read 1 Peter 3:1-6.</p>
<h3>
Ungodly Husbands
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Wives, likewise, be submissive to your own husbands, that even if some do not obey the word, they, without a word, may be won by the conduct of their wives," (1 Peter 3:1)</font></p>
<p>
The scripture now raises a question about women who's husbands have erred from the Way. The word of the world says, “Woman! You don't need him ... leave! You don't have to go through that! Walk out!” That's not what scripture says. Now who are you going to believe? Are you going to believe your "friends," or are you going to believe the Word of God? And that's the problem. There are too many women listening to too many wrong voices. God says if your husband is not a godly man yet, he can still be won without a word, by the behaviour of the wife! God didn't call you to be your husband's pastor. He didn't call you to preach to him. He didn't call you to be his nag. The way a messed up husband is won is not by the preaching skill of his wife. If you've noticed, the more you try to change him with your voice, the worse he gets. And you know why? Because you're dealing with the one thing that no man will compromise on, and that's his ego. A man will let you mess with a lot, but what he will not let you mess with is his ego. Men have fought and killed since the beginning of time for their ego!</p>
<p>
So what does the Lord want you to do when it comes to dealing with the husband's ego? He wants you to get out of the way so He can chastise him. God says be like Jesus in the same way. Now what was Jesus like?</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Who committed no sin, Nor was deceit found in His mouth: Who, when he was reviled, did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten;" (1 Peter 2:22-23)</font>
Jesus didn't threaten, he didn't say, “Oh, so you're going to be like that?! Well, I'll get even with you! Two can play at this game!” Jesus didn't manipulate with his voice, he didn't manipulate with tears. He did his Father's will and God made it work.</p>
<p>
Have you tried God's way to change your husband, or have you been fussing for 15 years? Because if you've been fussing for 15 years, you've been asking God not to change him, that you'll take care of it yourself.</p>
<p>
You should make your husband stare at you and wonder, “What's gotten into you?” when you ask your husband, “What can I do for you today?” When he comes home and he sees this haggard, burned-out, no-make-up looking wife, who looked good for Mr. Jones all day, and now he's got to hear, “Yea, I'm tired. What do you want to eat?! I bought some milk, there's some cereal, go get it yourself.” No, it should be more like, “Honey, what can I cook for you today? What would you like to eat? How can I take care of you? How can I look good for you?” And he's supposed to stare and say, “Huh?”</p>
<p>
Shock him with your help and your submission. Make him stare. Make him wonder what went wrong. Make him say, “Wow, I like this.” Now, you're probably saying, “You don't know my husband. He's going to take advantage of that.” God says, “You leave that to me.” He's asking you to trust in Him. As your husbands observe your chaste, holy and respectful behaviour, they may be won.</p>
<p>
"Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel; But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price."
Women spend a lot of time making themselves look good on the outside, but God says, that more importantly, make yourself good on the inside. There's no point in looking beautiful on the outside if you're ugly on the inside. So be beautiful on the inside! (1 Peter 3:3-4)</p>
<h3>
Language is Important
</h3>
<p>
In Gen 24, Rebecca was able to meet God's divine appointment for her life (marriage) because she was faithfully carrying out her current obligations. She had a ready willingness to serve others. These qualities put her in the right place at the right time with the right attitude when God intended to match her with Isaac. Isaac's servant asked for some water from her,<font color= "blue">
 "So she said, Drink, my lord ..." (Gen 24:18)</font>. She reverenced a stranger, and God used that stranger to bring Rebecca and Isaac in marriage.</p>
<h3>
Here's another example
</h3>
<p>
"Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord:" (1 Peter 3:6)
Sara reverenced her husband. How do you know? Because of how she talked to him. She said, “lord.” Now, look at your husband and say, “lord.” Practice it and say, “lord.” Take it one step further and say, “My lord.” In other words, her submission was not private, but universal. “Lord!”</p>
<p>
She calls Abraham, “lord.” God told her that in one year from now, she's going to get pregnant, <font color= "blue">
"... Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I have grown old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?" (Gen 18:12)</font>.</p>
<p>
What's the point? Sara was in an impossible situation, being 90 years old, her husband's 100, no pregnancy in sight, but she called him lord. And when God saw her reverence Abraham, Abraham could do things he couldn't do before, and Sara got pregnant! When she called him lord, God did something to him. If you reverence your husband, God can make him do things he can't do otherwise. God can turn his attitude around and his life around, if you do your part; if you get out of the way so God can dispense His loving chastisement and Grace.</p>
<p>
So reverence your husband; lift him up, embellish him, serve him, while he does the same for you.</p>
