Prayer of Petition
</h1>
<p>
The best example of such prayer is given by Jesus himself. Although He knew He would have to undergo suffering and death, and although He had already accepted this sacrifice, His human nature made Him spontaneously pray: <br><font color= "blue">"O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me;". (Matt 26:39)</font><br> By praying in this way to His Father, Jesus disposed His human nature to receive the strength it needed for the passion.</p>
<p>
As could be expected, Jesus' petition was not granted in the literal sense of the word. He Himself did not want it to be granted on His own terms.<br> He said: <font color= "blue">"not as I will, but as You will." (see: Matt 26:39; Luke 22:43-44)</font>.</p>
<p>
Is this not the pattern for prayer of petition which Jesus wanted to teach us? <font color= "blue">"May your will be done on earth as it is in heaven" (Matt 6:10)</font>.</p>
<p>
The remarkable outcome of Jesus' prayer only became apparent in Christ's resurrection. His new life in God was totally unexpected from a human point of view. It made Christ's suffering meaningful. It fulfilled both what God wanted and what Jesus, as a human individual, really wanted in terms of bringing wholeness to the world.</p> 
<p>
God's ultimate rule of events often lies beyond our grasp; as it was on Calvary. It means that God will have the last word, and that prayer has been heard and will be answered, in God's own way.</p>
