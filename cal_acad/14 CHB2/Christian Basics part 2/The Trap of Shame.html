The Trap of Shame
</h1>
<h3>
Churchianity
</h3>
<p>
While many people struggle with issues dealing with the institutional churches, there is a flip side to this issue, and it is the fact that multitudes of Christians are leaving churchianity (It is used to describe churches across many denominations where the central focus has moved from Christ to the church. Hence the replacement of Christ with church in the word churchianity.) forever. Not because they have given up on Jesus Christ, but to the contrary, because they want to follow Jesus Christ instead of men and the organisations of men.</p>
<p>
In his latest book Revolution (Tyndale; 2005) the famous George Barna has this to say on the back cover:<br>

"Millions of believers have moved beyond the established Church ... and chosen to be the Church instead".<br> Research by renowned pollster George Barna points to a hidden revolution -- one that will impact every Christian believer. Millions of committed Christ followers, looking for more of God, have stopped attending church on Sunday mornings. Why are they leaving? Where are they going? And what does this mean for the future of the Church?".</p>
<p>
Barna predicts that in the next twenty years only 30% of American Christians will be attending an institutional church, while 70% will be expressing their faith in Jesus Christ outside of the walls of the ages long institutional church system.</p>
<p>
Having been in a cult group for about twelve years in the past, ending in 1974, <br>I am of the conviction that the primary reason for cult groups has to do with the "clergy/laity" concept of churchianity, as well as the false foundation called "tithing" from which the money flows. I have suggested these resources in the past, and in my view it is extremely important that Christians be set free from the bondage of false doctrines and authoritarian leadership. It is often a great inner struggle for people to accept truth, when they have been deeply ingrained in error. It is not only in cult groups, but there is also a great deal of false teachings in "mainstream" institutional churchianity; for example, the very false "prosperity gospel", as well as tithing.</p>
<h3>
Tithing 
</h3>
<p>
I could only wish that every Christian website would post information about resources that will "set the captives free". One of the key issues that millions of Christians struggle with is the "tithing" issue. <br>In his very enlightening book Tithing: Low-Realm, Obsolete & Defunct (Tekoa Publishing; 2004), Matthew E. Narramore clearly proves from New Testament scriptures that tithing is a relic of ancient history, and is no more valid in the context of the New Covenant than physical circumcision or animal sacrifices.</p> <p>It is beyond dispute that the apostle (meaning "envoy" or "one sent" and not an "office of authority" over others) Paul never taught or demanded tithes of any of the groups of people he was a missionary to. In fact the envoy Paul was a tent maker, worked with his own hands, earned his own income, paid his own expenses, and coveted no man's gold or silver (Acts 20: 29-34). <br>This fantastic book is available through book outlets and can is also available for Free on-line reading at: http://www.tekoapublishing.com/books/.<br> In my personal opinion, this book should be in the hands of every Christian on earth, and especially gullible churchgoers sitting in the pews of institutional churches and paying "tithes". If the truth were known about this very false doctrine, it is very likely that the institutional church system of this world would collapse.</p>
<h3>
The Clergy 
</h3>
<p>
In addition to the tithing issue, the heart and core of the institutional church systems of this world has to do with the false belief in a special class of people called the "clergy" or "professional pastors, priests, or preachers".<br> In the awesome article "The Great Ecclesiastical Conspiracy", George Davis, Michael Clark, and Kirk Pearson prove conclusively that many passages of scripture in the King James Bible are woefully mistranslated in regard to this "priestly" class of "rulers". It becomes very clear as one reads and studies this issue, that those scriptures that say to "obey those who have the authority over you", are in fact intentionally mistranslated. These scriptures have led countless "pastors", "leaders" and millions of Christians to believe in an authoritarian type of leadership that Jesus Christ never ordained. This great article would help countless people to be set free in they are exposed to this truth, and it needs to be in the hands of every Christian on earth. The real Pastor/Shepherd/High priest/Mediator and Head of the Body is Jesus Christ, and not men, clergy, organisations, or "professional preachers" with flattering titles.</p>
