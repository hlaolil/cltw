Priorities
</h1>
<p>
We have two Kingdoms – our spiritual kingdom and our material kingdom.<br> And we can find ourselves unsuccessfully attempting to straddle our two kingdoms – one foot planted in each even while they continue to drift apart – leaving us facing our double trouble.</p>
<p>
The Bible offers several metaphors to expose the untenable position of attempting to live a contradictory double life and the trouble that comes from trying to straddle our two competing kingdoms.</p>
<p>
James tells us that <font color= "blue">“a double-minded man (is) unstable in all his ways.” <br>(James 1:8)</font></p>
<p> 
David declares, <font color= "blue">“I hate the double-minded ...” (Psa 119:113)</font></p>
<p> 
James adds, <font color= "blue">“... purify your hearts, you double-minded.” (James 4:8)</font></p>
<p>
In Psa 12:2 David provides a different metaphor – that of being double-hearted. 
In 1 Tim 3:8 Paul describes those who are double-tongued.<br> All these phrases describe the contradictory position of attempting to simultaneously and successfully keep one foot in our spiritual kingdom and the other foot in our material kingdom. In doing so, we are facing double trouble.</p>
<p>
Jesus said it this way, <font color= "blue">“No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and Mammon.” (Matt 6:24)</font>. <br> Jesus is expressing the impossibility of trying to successfully straddle these two kingdoms.</p>
<h3>
Picture This
</h3>
<p>
Here is how straddling these two kingdoms can functionally play out in our lives.  Our material possessions (time, talents, treasures, toys, etc.) are in our material kingdom. And on occasion, we are asked, compelled, coerced or convicted to give some of our stuff from our material kingdom to our spiritual kingdom, to be used for spiritual purposes. When we transfer some of our material assets over to the spiritual kingdom, it is recorded, reported and/or recognised.</p>
<p>
Contrast this picture with an alternative picture.  We wholly and solely live in only one kingdom – our spiritual kingdom.  At our conversion we willingly transferred everything we were and everything we had – and I mean everything – from our material kingdom to our spiritual kingdom and we abandoned our material kingdom.  We sang “All to Jesus I surrender, all to Him I freely give.” And really meant all – everything we have and everything we are is His.  We were all in the spiritual kingdom. (Not that any of our material stuff was ever really ours in the first place, but we did finally acknowledge that we had wrongly confiscated it and we were now willingly returning it to the rightful Owner.)<br> [See Psa 24:1; 50:10-12.]</p>
<p>
From that day forward it has no longer been a question of what will we transfer from our material kingdom to our spiritual kingdom. Everything we possess and everything we ever will possess is already in our spiritual kingdom to be used for Kingdom purposes whenever and however it is needed by our sovereign King. Let me ask you to think back. Did you indeed surrender and transfer all the possessions in your material kingdom now and forever into your spiritual kingdom when you surrendered to Christ?  Did you really “surrender all?”</p>
<p>
If the answer is yes, then your giving decisions are not really giving decisions.  They could more accurately be described as deployment decisions. <br>The term giving carries with it the implication that we are taking something from our material kingdom and “giving” it to our spiritual kingdom to be used for spiritual purposes.  The term deployment, to the contrary, simply focuses on how these resources already in the spiritual kingdom will be utilised to produce maximum impact and benefit for the King to whom these assets already belong.</p>
<p>
If we attempt to live with one foot in our spiritual kingdom and the other one in our material kingdom, we will find ourselves, double-minded, double-hearted, double-tongued and with a severe case of double-vision. <br> We will indeed find ourselves continually living with double trouble.</p>
<h3>
Vision Test
</h3>
<p>
It is interesting to note that right after Jesus tells us that we should not lay up treasures for ourselves in our material kingdom, but we should instead lay up treasures in our spiritual kingdom, and right before He tells us that we cannot simultaneously live in two different kingdoms (God and riches), He adds a powerful illustration <font color= "blue">“The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is good, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how great is that darkness!” (Matt 6:22-23)</font></p>
<p>
It is impossible for our two eyes to simultaneously focus on two different images.  Have you ever intentionally crossed your eyes? If you have you know that when you point your eyes in different directions, you can’t see anything clearly with either eye. We cannot focus on both our spiritual and our material kingdom at the same time and if we do we will find that we are in a compromising position that can never be maintained nor can it ever be totally fulfilling.</p>
<h3>
Where are You Standing?
</h3>
<p>
Ask yourself, “Where am I standing right now? Am I trying to straddle these two different kingdoms, hoping to enjoy the best that both kingdoms have to offer?” If the answer is, “Yes,” then you are indeed in double trouble. May I suggest that the superior option for us, if we have not already done so, is to transfer everything we have into one kingdom – our spiritual kingdom. In doing so, something glorious will happen.  We will find ourselves becoming singled-minded, single-hearted, single-tongued and single-visioned. We will now be single-focused on what God wants us to do with what we are carrying of His material things in His spiritual kingdom to be used for His divine purposes for His ultimate glory. <br> If we get into the right kingdom, the spiritual kingdom,  heading in the right direction with an eternal perspective in mind, we will experience what Paul describes as <font color= "blue">“eternal life.” (1 Tim 6:19)</font>. Let’s think: Double trouble or eternal life?  Not really a very difficult choice, is it? Let me encourage you, starting today, be all in your spiritual kingdom!
