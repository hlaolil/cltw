Reaping from the Gospel
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
Then Peter began to say to Him, “See, we have left all and followed You".<br>  So Jesus answered and said, “Assuredly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands, for My sake and the gospel’s, who shall not receive a hundredfold now in this time—houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions—and in the age to come, eternal life." (Mark 10:28-30)</font></p>
<h3>
Receiving a hundredfold now with persecution
</h3>
<p>
What's the best investment you can make with your life? <br>The gospel presents us with a paradox: we lose what we keep, and we gain what we give away.  When we lose our lives for Christ, we gain a priceless treasure and an inheritance which last forever. Whatever we give to God comes back a hundredfold. Generosity flows from a heart full of gratitude for the abundant mercy and grace which God grants. <br> Do you give freely and generously?  And why do you give, for reward or for love?  Right after a wealthy young man refused to follow Jesus, Peter, somewhat crudely, wanted to know what he and the other disciples would get out of it since they had freely accepted Jesus’ offer to follow Him unconditionally. </p>
<p>
Jesus spoke with utter honesty: Those who left all for Him would receive a hundred times more now, even in this life, as well as unending  life in the age to come. Jesus’ disciples can expect opposition and persecution from those who are opposed to Christ and His gospel. Should we be surprised if we lose favour and experience ridicule, intimidation, and injury when we take a stand for truth and righteousness? In place of material wealth, Jesus promised His disciples the blessing and joy of rich fellowship with the community of believers.</p>
<p>
No earthly good or possession can rival the joy and bliss of knowing God and the peace and unity He grants to His disciples. The Lord wants to fill our hearts with the vision of heaven and with His joy and peace. Do you know the joy of following the Lord as His disciple?  Ask the Holy Spirit to fill you with the joy of the gospel and the knowledge of God’s personal love.</p>
<p>
"Lord I want to follow you as your disciple and to love you wholeheartedly with all that I have. Fill my heart with faith, hope, and love that I may always find peace and joy in your presence."</p>
