We Posses the Lord Owns

<h3>
Material things in the beginning
</h3>
<p>
A good place to begin a study of the subject of money and material things is: 
<font color= "blue">“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth." (Gen 1:1.)</font> We learn here as the Bible opens that God owns everything because He created everything</p>
<p>
David wrote,  <font color= "blue">“The earth is the Lord's, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it; for he founded it upon the seas and established it upon the waters." (Psa 24:1-2)</font><br> 
If God made it, He owns it because creation establishes ownership.</p>
<p>
God made the whole earth so it’s all his. He then put man in it and gave Adam the first job – to rule over the animals and to tend the garden. As their salary Adam and Eve could eat of anything in the garden – except one tree of course.</p>
<p>
Like Adam and Eve, we were also created by God. We have been given food by God. We have been given a place to live by God. We belong to God along with everything we think is ours. It’s all God’s stuff!</p>
<p>
It was a great garden residence that God gave Adam and Eve. The garden even had gold and other valuables (Gen 2:10-12). But anything they “had” really must not have been theirs. We know that because when they sinned, they were driven from the garden and didn’t take anything with them (Gen 3:24).
They lived in God’s garden and enjoyed God’s food gifts and everything else, but it was all God’s. Because of sin, they lost access to it all.</p>
<p>
If we have ever lost our job, gone bankrupt, watched our portfolio shrink, had something repossessed, or ever been forced to down-size or sell off, we should have learned that everything belongs to God. He creates wealth and anything else He gives us to use, but none of it is really our possession. If it can be taken away, it’s not ours.</p>
<h3>
You can’t take it with you
</h3>
<p>
If we don’t learn it by life experiences, there is something we should learn from every funeral. We don’t “own” anything because we don’t take it with us.</p>
<p>
Solomon, the wisest man ever, said,<font color= "blue"> As he came from his mother’s womb, naked shall he return, to go as he came; and he shall take nothing from his labour which he may carry away in his hand" (Eccl 5:15)</font>.</p>
<p>
The apostle Paul concurred, <font color= "blue">"For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out" (1 Tim 6:7)</font>.</p> 
<p>
Job, at his lowest point worshipfully agreed, saying,<font color= "blue"> "Naked I came from my mother’s womb, and naked shall I return there. The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord." (Job 1:21)</font></p>
<p>
God didn’t stutter about how temporary material things are. We only have them for a little while.
A heart attack or some form of death is coming. That means we need to emotionally pry our fingers off what we thought we owned. And with that in view, we must conclude that we are not owners. We are stewards.
Stewardship is the most basic of all biblical concepts about material things. So what is a steward? Very simply, stewards manage the property of others.</p>
<h3>
Joseph the Steward
</h3>
<p>
Joseph is a prime example of a steward as Genesis records. Potiphar <font color= "blue">"made him overseer of his house ... Thus he left all that he had in Joseph’s hand, and he did not know what he had except for the bread which he ate.” (Gen 39:4-6a.)</font></p>
<p>
Joseph didn’t own anything in Egypt at this point. He was a slave of Potiphar. But that didn’t keep Potiphar from entrusting to him all that he owned. Joseph probably bought all the food for the household of this important man. He probably managed his fields and work crews. He made sure the house was repaired. He seemingly even did the books, because a few verses later (Gen 39:9) it is clear that he was in charge of everything except Potiphar’s wife.</p>
<p>
As a manager, surely Joseph was able to eat the finest foods and wear the best clothes himself. Stewards often can enjoy the things they manage. 
Joseph gives us a model of what it means financially to be a steward of God’s things materially. We manage what belongs to others. Stewards are much like bank tellers or portfolio managers. They handle or control a lot of money, but they better not start thinking of it as their own.</p>
<h3>
The Steward’s real job is Faithfulness
</h3>
<p>
God has clear instructions for stewards. <font color= "blue">"... it is required in stewards that one be found faithful.” (1 Cor 4:2)</font>. The Greek term “steward” here includes a form of the word, house. It describes a household manager in the ancient Greek world who handled the finances for the owner. Managers are accountable to owners for how they use their finances or material possessions.
Owners will hold managers accountable! And God will hold us accountable for anything He has entrusted to us. There is seriousness to having things!</p>
<p>
Now back to Joseph. We know that Joseph was falsely accused and was thrown into jail unfairly. That doesn’t sound fair for someone who was a faithful steward does it. However, at the end of the story, where is Joseph? He is a steward again – in a big way! Joseph became the prime minister of Egypt, in charge of the palace, in charge of everything and everyone except Pharaoh himself. And Joseph evidently could even use Pharaoh’s signet ring any way he chose (Gen 41:40-42)!

Why did this happen? God made it happen because Joseph was a faithful steward.</p>
<p>
So we learn two principles from Joseph about the way God views stewardship.</p>
<p>
1) Stewards manage the property of others.</p>
<p> 
2) Stewards who are faithful receive greater privileges.</p>
<h3>
How God rewards of good stewardship
</h3>
<p>
Managing a little leads to managing a lot. Do you agree? Look at what Jesus said:  " He who is faithful in what is least is faithful also in much; and he who is unjust in what is least is unjust also in much." (Luke 16:10)

What is Jesus talking about? Was He promising to make us richer financially if we are faithful stewards of our money, as some in the prosperity movement teach? No He isn’t. Although I imagine that the apostle Paul was faithful with any money he handled, he certainly wasn’t wealthy. In fact, he was often in complete poverty – and content with that, in fact (Phil 4:10-11).</p>
<p>
So if the promise of financial wealth is not what Jesus is teaching, what is He teaching? He is teaching the surprising truth that God uses our stewardship financially to determine how much He can trust us with spiritually.

Look at how Jesus explains it. <font color= "blue"></font>"Therefore if you have not been faithful in the unrighteous Mammon, who will commit to your trust the true riches? And if you have not been faithful in what is another man’s, who will give you what is your own?” (Luke 16:11-12)</font></p>
<p>
What did Jesus mean by “property of our own?” It’s eternal things! Jesus is saying that God is testing our financial stewardship to determine who He can trust us with spiritual and ministry privileges that last forever. Our management of money affects the eternal impact we will have. That is the “property” we can keep. It’s eternal!

Jesus never promised us worldly wealth here on earth, but He does say that the way we manage whatever amount of money or worldly possessions we have is really a spiritual test. And God is grading that test. How much we have is not an indication of our spirituality; how we manage what we have is an indication of our spirituality.</p>
<p>
Some believers will be tested on their stewardship with a six-figure income. It’s a test one which God may give them a grade of A, B C, D or F. Other believers will be tested with subsistence level living and receive the same variety of grades.

Stewardship testing starts early and lasts throughout life. Grade school children are tested when they get an allowance. High school students with a part-time job are being tested. Our management of money continues through our working life and retirement. God is looking for people he can trust with real eternal things – and He uses our management of entrusted money and possessions in that evaluation.

So every financial decision is a spiritual decision. Stewardship means a whole different way of thinking.</p>
<h3>
Stewards think different than owners
</h3>
<p>
What does God want me to do with this pay check? That’s the real question, because it’s really God’s pay check. Our budget is His budget. How does God want me to allocate what He has given me? How does God want me to use this house? It’s his house. How should I use extra money? How much should I save, invest, spend or give away? It’s all His. How should I use it? Should I buy this car, this piece of furniture or even this book or candy bar? The size of the purchase isn’t the issue. What matters is that it’s all God’s money and I must decide how He wants me to use it.

The point is that stewards think different than owners. Here are four specific areas about which stewards think differently than those who think they own possessions. The remaining chapters will explore these key areas of stewardship.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
1. Stewards are grateful and content</font></p>
<p>
I can be content with what I have if I accept that God picked it out for me (Phil 4:12, 18). If I resent what others have, or demean what I have, I’m not a faithful steward.

Sometimes we complain about our material things by calling them “junk.” But if God owns everything, then what we call “junk” is actually His junk. He gave it to us. Can God trust us to appreciate our 15-year old car, generic food and second hand clothing? It’s really the same issue for the poor as the very wealthy. Gratitude is an attitude stewardship issue. There is always an upgrade. 

Stewardship means we are peace with the fact that I’m not someone else. I’m me and God lovingly has given me the skills and the job and the money I need for right now. God assigns everything in life. It’s really submission to God when we are content with our job, our income and all our material things.

Understanding that we just manage what God chooses to give us also sets the foundation of another key financial issue for a Christian:</p>
<p><font size="+1">
2. Stewards give willingly</font></p>
<p>
God asks for a “tithe” so we can express that He owns it all and that we trust Him to provide our needs (Mal 3:10-11). Only when we come to grips with the fact that we are stewards, not owners, does giving come willingly.

If I really believe that God is the owner and I am a steward of my money, then that’s how I should feel about my giving also. He determines my flow of income and what I should be “paid.” I only have to be faithful to allocate it the way He wants. And if He wants a 10th or any other percentage, that’s not a problem. He’s the owner.</p>
<p>
Giving God a percentage is the foundational way we express that we accept the fact that we are stewards and He’s the owner. While we sacrifice emotionally – letting go of ownership – at the same time we enter a new emotional freedom called trust. We can rest knowing that God will supply the rest that we need.

Thinking like managers instead of owners also enables us to really enjoy what God gives us materially.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
3. Stewards can enjoy blessings</font></p>
<p>
God allows stewards to have many good things to enjoy. I don’t have to “bless” myself. Paul told wealthy Christians to not <font color= "blue">“trust in uncertain riches but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy.” (1 Tim 6:17)</font>.</p>
<p>
Frankly, almost everyone reading this is rich in this present world by global standards and by the standards of living Paul was acquainted with as he wrote. And it’s good to know that it is not wrong to enjoy what we have if we live as true stewards.

Sometimes we might think that if we do God’s will we are taking a vow of poverty. While living very frugally might be God’s will for some, God also gives each person different kinds of material blessings. Sometimes when my wife and I have been the tightest financially, God has blessed us with high quality bargains that upgraded something in our house or gave us a special vacation at almost no cost.

Thinking like stewards does not mean we give up good things. It means that we give up control. And a stewardship mindset does not mean that we don’t enjoy good things. It actually means that we enjoy things more.</p>
<p>
Enjoyment does not have a price tag. Many who are more wealthy find it hard to enjoy what they have, because true enjoyment comes only from God (Eccl 2:24,25; 4:8). If we earn our money selfishly, we will spend it selfishly, and selfish people don’t enjoy much. Selfish people complain the most – whether they are digging ditches or staying at a posh resort. On the other hand, as we think and live as God’s stewards, and then God gives us extra blessings – extra money or possessions after being faithful and generous – we really can enjoy them!</p>
<p>
Stewards can truly enjoy God’s blessings because they know that God owns it all and controls it all. I simply get to enjoy it as I learn to manage it.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
4. Stewards realise work is a gift</font></p>
<p>
Stewards realise that God enables us to earn any money we have. We didn’t make ourselves so smart or good at what we do. Because we work so hard, it’s pretty natural to think that the money we earn is really ours. We know the training we went through, the hours we go in early, the little techniques we have developed to do a good job and be successful at what we do. We are probably very good at something we do in our jobs.

So when our pay check is in our hand we don’t go away feeling guilty. We earned it! We put up with a lot and got the job done right. Thank me very much!

So it’s a little hard to swallow the thought that it all belongs to God! This self-righteous thought was anticipated by God in Deut 8:17-18. “You may say to yourself, "My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me." But remember the LORD your God, for it is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth, and so confirms his covenant, which he swore to your forefathers, as it is today."</p>
<p>
Stewardship means really seeing our job as God’s gift. Whatever our job, it’s all possible only because God enabled us to do it.</p>
<h3>
Relax, it’s not really yours
</h3>
<p>
Sometimes we get all bent out of shape trying to keep and defend what we think is ours. People ruin their lives over financial rights, inheritance squabbles, and suing people they think cheated them. But God is calling us to think different – to be stewards – to just faithfully manage what God gives us.</p>
