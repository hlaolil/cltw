Roles of Husband and Wife

<h3>
God's Rules for Marriage
</h3>
<p>
Although males and females are equal in relationship to Christ, the Scriptures give specific roles to each in marriage. The husband is to assume leadership in the home (1 Cor 11:3; Eph 5:23). This leadership should not be dictatorial, condescending, or patronising to the wife, but should be in accordance with the example of Christ leading the church.<font color= "blue"> “Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her, that He might sanctify and cleanse her with the washing of water by the word,” (Eph 5:25-26)</font>.</p> Christ loved the church (His people) with compassion, mercy, forgiveness, respect, and selflessness. In this same way husbands are to love their wives.</p>
<p>
Wives are to submit to the authority of their husbands. <font color= "blue">“Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is head of the church; and He is the Saviour of the body. Therefore, just as the church is subject to Christ, so let the wives be to their own husbands in everything” (Eph 5:22-24)</font>.</p>
<p>
Although women should submit to their husbands, the Bible also tells men several times how they are supposed to treat their wives. The husband is not to take on the role of the dictator, but should show respect for his wife and her opinions. In fact, Eph 5:28-29 exhorts men to love their wives in the same way that they love their own bodies, feeding and caring for them. A man’s love for his wife should be the same as Christ’s love for His body, the church.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Wives, submit to your own husbands, as is fitting in the Lord. Husbands, love your wives and do not be bitter toward them” (Col 3:18-19)</font>.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Husbands, likewise, dwell with them with understanding, giving honour to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be hindered.” (1 Peter 3:7)</font>.</p> 
<p>
From these verses we see that love and respect characterise the roles of both husbands and wives. If these are present, then authority, headship, love, and submission will be no problem for either partner.</p>
<h3>
Division of Responsibilities
</h3>
<p>
In regard to the division of responsibilities in the home, the Bible instructs husbands to provide for their families. This means he works and makes enough money to sufficiently provide all the necessities of life for his wife and children. To fail to do so has definite spiritual consequences. <font color= "blue">“If anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever” (1 Tim 5:8)</font>.</p> 
<p>
So, a man who makes no effort to provide for his family cannot rightly call himself a Christian. This does not mean that the wife cannot assist in supporting the family—Prov 31 demonstrates that a godly wife may surely do so—but providing for the family is not primarily her responsibility; it is her husband’s.</p> 
<p>
While a husband should help with the children and with household chores (thereby fulfilling his duty to love his wife), Prov 31 also makes it clear that the home is to be the woman’s primary area of influence and responsibility. Even if she must stay up late and rise up early, her family is well cared for. This is not an easy lifestyle for many women—especially in affluent Western nations. However, far too many women are stressed out and stretched to the breaking point. To prevent such stress, both husband and wife should prayerfully reorder their priorities and follow the Bible’s instructions on their roles.</p>
<p>
Conflicts regarding the division of labour in a marriage are bound to occur, but if both partners are submitted to Christ, these conflicts will be minimal. If a couple finds arguments over this issue are frequent and vehement, or if arguments seem to characterise the marriage, the problem is a spiritual one. In such an instance, the partners should recommit themselves to prayer and submission to Christ first, then to one another in an attitude of love and respect.</p>
