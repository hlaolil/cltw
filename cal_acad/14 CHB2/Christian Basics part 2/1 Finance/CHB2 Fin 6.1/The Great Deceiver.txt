<h3>
What Satan Wants
</h3>
<p>
What is Satan’s goal? What is He trying to do?
Satan’s goal is to promote himself and his glory by opposing God. In reality, just the opposite is happening. In God’s plan, Satan is bringing glory to God by his opposition.
<h3>
Satan's Power 
</h3>
<p>
To what degree is Satan free to do what He wants? How much power does He have?
Satan has considerable power, but he is not at all free. As we can see from Job 1 and 2, Satan can do nothing to Job apart from God’s permission. God permits Satan to do only that which is a part of His plan.</p>
<p>
From all that we can discern from Scripture, Satan is intelligent but no longer wise. His perspective and thinking are warped by his own arrogance and ambition. He has a broad-based network of demons, which keep him up well informed. Satan is not God, nor does he possess the attributes of God. He is powerful, but not all-powerful; He knows much, but he does not know all.
<h3>
What are Satan’s weapons? 
</h3>
<p>
What gives him the power to work as he does? What means does he employ?
Satan weapons are the flesh and the world. Most often, Satan works indirectly, through these means. In addition, Satan employs fallen demons, unbelievers, and even the failures of the saints (like Peter in Matt 16:23). There are other beings, such as the two beasts of Rev 13 and the false prophet (Rev 16:13; 19:20; 20:10).</p>
<p>
Satan’s power comes from God’s divine providence which allows him to do what he does. In addition, Satan has the power and authority rendered to him by the fallen angels (demons) who have followed him in rebellion. Further, Satan has power to affect men. This comes through the internal “pull” of the flesh and through the external “push” of the world.</p>
<h3>
What is Satan’s destiny?
</h3>
<p>
Defeat and doom. His downfall was first pronounced in Isa 14 and Ezek 28. It was promised in Gen 3:15. Jesus spoke of his defeat in John 16:11. He is defeated by the Lord Jesus Christ, specifically through the death, burial, and resurrection of our Lord. He is overcome at the cross, but his full and final defeat is future (see Rom 16:20). Through the preaching of the gospel and personal faith in Christ, men are being delivered from Satan’s grasp and granted eternal life (Acts 26:18; Eph 2:1-10; Col 1:13; 2 Tim 2:24-26; 1 Peter 2:9). Sometime in the future Satan will be cast out of heaven, and his anger toward God and men will be intensified in its expression toward men in the limited time he has remaining (Rev 12:1-12). Just before the 1000 year reign of our Lord, Satan will be bound, so that he cannot oppose men or God (Rev 20:1-6). After 1000 years of living under God’s rule, Satan will be released for a time, and many will choose to follow him. This leads to a final battle between Satan and his followers and God and His saints (Rev 20:7-9). Satan will be thrown into the lake of fire forever, along with all who have followed him (Rev 20:10-15).</p>
<h3>
Why does God allow Satan to exist and do what he does?
</h3>
<p>
Satan’s creation, fall, and opposition was all included in God’s plan for creation. Satan’s fall and opposition to God is the instrument by which man fell (Gen 3). Satan’s existence must be understood in the light of sin and also of God’s plan. God’s plan is to demonstrate His glory. Ex 33:17--34:7 teaches that God’s glory is displayed in the way God deals with sin. For some, God deals graciously, forgiving them of their sins; for others, God punishes them for their sins. Apart from the existence of sin, the demonstration of God’s glory would not have been possible in its fullest form. Sin is the occasion for God’s glory, and thus He has included it in His plan, along with Satan, its promoter.</p>
<h3>
What is the relationship between non-Christians and Satan? 
</h3>
<p>
(See John 8:44; Acts 26:18; 2 Cor 4:4; Eph 2:1-3; 1 John 3:8,10)
Satan is the ruler of the kingdom of darkness. That kingdom includes every person who has not trusted in Christ. The “father” of the unbeliever is the Devil. His followers behave as he does (John 8:44). Whether men realize it or not, they are under his control, and they do his bidding. Often his control comes indirectly through the world or the flesh. Men may think they are free, but they are actually Satan’s slaves. Satan works hard to keep men from the truth--and from deliverance from him and his kingdom which comes through believing in Christ (Luke 8:12; 2 Cor 4:4).</p>
<h3>
How does Satan seek to work in the life of a Christian?
</h3>
<p> 
Satan seeks to destroy the Christian (1 Peter 5:8). To do this, Satan seeks to distort the truth, to deceive the Christian, and ultimately to turn the Christian away from simple faith and obedience in Christ (see 2 Cor 11:3; 1 Tim 4:1-5). Often, Satan will disguise himself or his teaching as coming from a true believer as an “angel of light” (2 Cor 11:12-15).</p>
<h3>
Satan the Master of Disguise
</h3>
<p>
Satan is a master of disguise, a creature with many faces. What are some of the forms which Satan takes, in his efforts to resist God and destroy men?<br>
Satan the invisible, non-existent one. The Devil is a myth.
Satan under cover. Satan working invisibly, or through some intermediary
Satan, the accuser (Zech 3:1-2; Rev 12:10).
Satan, the tempter (Matt 4:3; 1 Thess 3:5).
Satan, the religious, legalistic, hypocrite (1 Tim 4:1-5).</p>
<h3>
God’s Ultimate Goal
</h3>
<p>
It is my understanding that the goal of God’s plan is the demonstration of His glory. Further, I believe the means is the establishment of God’s rule over the whole creation. The expression, “son of God” is a significant one in establishing God’s rule. Technically speaking, Jesus is not the only “son of God,” He is the Son of God who alone can establish the rule of God over creation. Satan was the first “son of God” who failed to rule as God’s prince. Adam too was a “son of God” (Luke 3:38), who was to rule for God (Gen 1:26). Israel was next chosen as God’s “son” (Ex 4:23; Hosea 11:1), followed by David and his dynasty (2 Sam 7:12-16). All these sons failed to fulfil their calling as God’s “son.” The only solution was for the “son” to be a sinless man, the God-man, Jesus Christ. Thus, Jesus came as the “son of God” to fulfil that calling (Psa 2:4-9; Matt 2:15; 16:16; 17:5; Luke 3:22ff.; Heb 1:5; 5:5). Jesus is the Son of God, who will establish God’s righteous rule over all creation. In this “sonship” every Christian will share, so that we will reign with Him (Rom 8:14-25).</p>
