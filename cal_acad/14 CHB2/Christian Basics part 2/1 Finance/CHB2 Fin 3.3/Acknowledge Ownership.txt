Proverbs 3:5-10 is the core of our success with God spiritually, physically, and emotionally. Following these verses will put you at the top of the balance scale for whatever you need.  Sometimes I read these verses daily, when I don't, I keep them in my heart and mind. That's how important they are.</p>
<h3>
Lean Not on Your Own Understanding
</h3>
<p>
These verses are a guide for helping us live the Kingdom Lifestyle found in the book of  Matt 6:31-34.  There God tells us that if we centre upon Him all things will be added to us.  We have the promise of receiving all our needs and wants by trusting in Him and living for today.  The instruction for how to do that are found in Prov 3:5-10.  They are God's instruction for our living in the present with the promise of having all we could want or need supplied to us.

The simplicity of these verses leaves one to think, I can do this!  Yet for many it can be difficult to trust God as they slip into their own understanding by habit.  Because this was a problem for me I know many of the pitfalls that keep Christians from applying these principles to their lives.  So to begin, let's break them down.
<h3>
Trust God With All Your Heart
</h3>
<p><font size="+1">   
Elements and Principles</font></p>
<p>
Lean not on your own understanding
Acknowledge Him (God)
Do not be wise in your own eyes; Fear the Lord
Honour the Lord with your possessions, and with the first fruits of all your increase</p>
<p>
Prov 3:5 tells us that we trust in the Lord with all of our hearts by not leaning or relying upon our own understanding. The first step then is to find out how to lean upon God's understanding.  How do we get into His mind? 
Let's get into our own minds first.  Our understanding is based upon an accumulation of knowledge, wisdom, experience, parental influences and environments that we have lived from the moment we were born. So how do we shut off all of that information and let God take over when we were taught to believe that God's mind is too vast and infinite for us to fathom?</p>
<p>
God has given us His Word to understand Him.  As we rely upon His inspired Word instead of our preconceived ideas about how things should be, it will come alive in us and give us guidance by the Holy Spirit that will move mountains instead of allowing mountains to bury us.</p>
<p>
For instance, when we choose to remain angry with a loved one and not accept their apology, we are choosing our own understanding that says, "they hurt me so now I will hurt them back."  However if we choose God's understanding, we will automatically forgive, even if we don't want to because God tells us to do so.  Doing this is understanding the "mind of God" and the mind of Christ as well because they are one.</p>  
<p>
Leaning upon God's understanding is how we trust God.  So as you read the Word and learn what it says, incorporate those teachings into your life and shift to them as you go through your day.  Practice this and in time you will see a positive difference in your life.</p>
<h3>
God's Understanding vs Man's Understanding
</h3>
<p>
This wisdom makes Prov 3:6 easy to understand because it is the reward that follows when you practice and live this lifestyle which I have already said is "kingdom living."  So this takes away the mystery from what kingdom living is all about.  It's simply leaning upon God's understanding or acknowledging Him, and when you do, God will direct your paths.  This means that He will give you guidance. </p>
<p>
Many Christians say that they want to know God's will for their lives, but they don't or "won't" lean upon God's wisdom.  They look only to what they know and act upon that.  If you want to live God's will for your life, then turn your will over to Him.  As long as Christians keep acting upon their past experience or emotions to make judgements or to make important decisions, they are never going to get past where they are today.</p>
<p>
Prov 3:7 is giving us the same information, only it's emphasising the need for us to measure ours lives against scripture to refrain from living in ways that are hurtful to ourselves and others. The Bible clearly tells us which behaviours are good and which behaviours are going to cause us trouble.   You have to make the choice to choose God's understanding or your own emotional or mental reasoning for holding unto what is not productive in your life. </p> 
<p>
If you acknowledge God's ways, then you will be directed down the corresponding path of success for what it is you need or desire. Choosing an emotional need, such as enjoying to create drama or gossiping for example, could send you on the path of destruction, so it is wise to trust God through His Word over what you feel or want to do.</p> 
<p>
Prov 3:7 also tells us that to trust God is to "fear the Lord."  By looking to God's wisdom you will fear the Lord because we're told that it is the same as abiding by His wisdom.  So fear God by leaning upon Him and His ways and you will be living the Kingdom Lifestyle."</p>
<p>
The largest reward of trusting God with all of our hearts is HEALTH according to Prov 3:8.  Without good health what good is anything?</p>
<p>
By allowing God to guide us, we will avoid the kind of stress that takes away from our lives and causes illness.  We won't want to do the kind of things that will harm our bodies such as smoking, drinking or overeating.  Eating too much sugar (a problem of my past) can be just as detrimental as smoking in some people, so we must consider God's wisdom over our desires to eliminate habits that will cause our bodies harm.</p> 
<p>
So trusting God gives us a package of blessings that even covers our health!    

"But wait!!!, as the commercials always say, "there's more ..."

Oh yes, there is much more--God's Wealth Plan.</p>
<h3>
Trust God Through Financial Giving
</h3>
<p>
Prov 3:9. Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the first fruits of all thine increase:
Prov 3:10. So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.</p>
<p>
There is very little to say about Prov 3:9 and 10.  God is telling us that if we honour Him with the first fruits of all of our increase (tithes) our barns will be filled!   That coincides with what Mal 3:10-11 tells us about paying tithes. We're told that we will receive a "windows of Heaven blessing" that is so great there will not be room enough to receive it in our storehouses. </p> 
<p>
The Bible uses many analogies that have to do with farming because the people at that time could best identify with farming terms.  For today we can say that there will not be room enough in our banks to hold all of the money that we're going to receive.</p>
<p>
The first 10 percent, or what we can afford, or more of everything we earn or receive monetarily belongs to God and as we honour Him with it, we will see great blessings.  So many Christians wonder why they are not blessed financially and this could be the reason why; they are not tithing.  This is probably one of the most difficult areas of our lives to trust God with -- our money, but when we recognise that God is giving us an opportunity to be blessed financially we will see that we cannot afford not to give. </p>
