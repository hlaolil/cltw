Generosity not Selfishness

Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over will be put into your bosom. For with the same measure that you use, it will be measured back to you.” (Luke 6:38)</font></p>
<h3>
Receiving from God: 
</h3>
<p>
Jesus makes the promise that if we give, we will receive in return from the Lord. We are to give because we have been gracious recipients of His generosity and because He is our Lord, the owner of everything, who will faithfully reward us for what we give according to His perfect timing and standards. One of the most significant ways that we receive God’s generosity is through the gift of forgiveness, which carries the obligation that we must also forgive others (Matt 6:14-15). </p>
<h3>
Giving not to Receive
</h3>
<p>
This concept seems to be linked to Christian generosity: Because God has provided most generously for us, we must give without the expectation of receiving anything back (Luke 6:30). In addition, our imitation of God’s generosity is not to be targeted only at people we like; just as He gave to us when we were still His enemies (Rom 5:6-8; Eph 2:1-7), we are to give to our enemies, those who hate us, those who steal from us and everyone else who asks (Luke 6:30).</p>
<p>
Of course, we must exercise discretion—there are times that our giving could be leveraged by others to perpetuate lifestyles of premeditated sin, but we should approach these situations with fear and trembling, realising the seriousness (and nearness) of sin in this part of our lives (Gen 4:7). The principle remains that we must give to people whom we find unappealing or simply don’t like. Yet as we obey, we find again that God is gracious. When we give in this way, He delights to reward us in far better ways than we could “reward ourselves” with our resources. While from the surrounding context we are clearly not supposed to be looking for our reward from men, the Scriptures do commend us to look for rewards from God (Heb 11:24-26).</p> 
<p>
God is not a cosmic vending machine (we don’t give Him money so that we can selfishly get better things back), but He will reward us as He sees fit—now, in eternity, financially or with other rewards. It is tempting for us to use our own methods to garner rewards from others, but God gives us rewards that are far better. If we surrender our gifts to Him, He will bless us with rewards better than those we could gain ourselves.</p>
