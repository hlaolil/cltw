The Future of the Household

Looking after your own

But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. (1 Tim 5:8)</font></p>
<p>
God has ordained the family unit in part so that we can meet one another’s needs. Few social structures, if any, have fed more widows, raised more orphans, and encouraged more lonely elderly people than families taking care of other family members in need. Paul’s words indicate that we also must consider what role we should play for extended family members—aunts, uncles and cousins. Unfortunately our society has all but lost much of this impulse. But we must consider how God would have us care for those in need around us. Do we have family members who need shelter, housing, companionship, nutrition and medical care?</p>
<h3>
Teach Us To Number Our Days  
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“The days of our lives are seventy years; and if by reason of strength they are eighty years, yet their boast is only labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away. Who knows the power of Your anger? For as the fear of You, so is your wrath. So teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom.” (Psa 90:10-12)</font></p>
<p>
This Psalm is a prayer attributed to Moses. Ultimately our lives are short in comparison to eternity. This means that we should realistically look at our lives, and the limited time we have remaining on this earth. The only thing of our own for which we can boast is labour and sorrow. Soon we will be cut off, and like those who have come before us, we will breathe our last breath.</p>
<p>
God is righteous and just, and He will judge all sin. Therefore we should stand in awe of God’s mighty power and fierce wrath against all evil. The angels who sinned and sinners in hell know the power of God’s anger. However, the power of God’s anger and wrath will not come upon His people, because it has already been displayed against sin through the cross. Are you counted among God’s people? Have you repented of your sin and trusted in Christ alone for your salvation? If so, you can surely know that God will have mercy on you for the sake of Christ’s merit and that your sins have been judged and paid for at the cross.</p>
<p>
Once we realise that our lives are very short and will soon fade away, we should ask God to teach us to number our days. Only then will we gain the wisdom in our hearts that it is not this world which we strive to gain, but the eternal life which is in Christ Jesus. Based on this knowledge, we can live each day to the glory of God, knowing that ultimately our lives are hidden with Christ in God (cf. Col. 3:3)</p>
