<h1>
Your Needs, Wants and Desires
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
"If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will[a] ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you. By this My Father is glorified, that you bear much fruit; so you will be My disciples." (John 15:7-8)</font><br>
God also wants us to "bear fruit" as a result of a productive prayer life.</p>
<h3>
Called To Be Fruit-Bearers 
</h3>
<p>
Upon reading these Scriptures, we see that "fruit" comes from prayer. The word "abide" in verse seven means, "to live in, to settle in, or to take up residence in." It implies permanency. Notice what it says in verse eight: "By this My Father is glorified, ..."<br>
In other words, our Father receives glory because of the Scriptural asking of the saints based upon the Word abiding in them. Things happen in the earth because the saints of God pray according to the Word, and they get results.</p>
<p>
I believe one reason why things have not happened for Christians is because of their failure to operate properly in the area of prayer. So, we will specifically look at seven things from the Scriptures for which believers are to pray. Somewhere in these seven different areas of prayer is what you need ...
<h3>
1. Pray For Your Persecutors
</h3>
<p> 
We can find the first thing to pray for in Matt 5
<p><font color= "blue"> 
You have heard that it was said, "You shall love your neighbour and hate your enemy." But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more than others? Do not even the tax collectors do so? Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect.(Matt 5:43-48)</font</p>
<p>
In Matt 5:44, I want you to pay particular attention to two of the four things Jesus gave us to do. Jesus said to "... pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you." The word spitefully refers to those who have insulted or scorned you, or to those who have contempt, malice, and hatred toward you and have abused you. Jesus told us to pray for them.</p>
<p>
Do you know anybody who has insulted you, scorned you, who has malice and hatred for you? Well, the word from the Lord for you is: "Pray for those people who come to mind as you read this."<br>

The word "persecute" means to, "pursue in a manner for injury or to cause to suffer because of a belief." It also means to inflict and urge an attack upon.</p>
<p>
Jesus is requiring you to pray for these people, not pray that fire falls from heaven on them or that the devil gets them. No! Jesus wants you to pray for their good. You cannot be a doer of the Word if you're not praying for those who persecute you.
When you pray for them, God can move on their behalf.</p>
<h3>
2. Your Needs
</h3>
<p> 
The second thing to pray for is found in Matt 6: <font color= "blue">"Therefore do not be like them. For your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him" (Matt 6:8).</font></p>
<p>
Asking of God is part of prayer. It is scriptural to pray for your needs. But you don't have to spend all your time praying for your needs. You don't have to get before God to tell Him, "I need this, and I need that."<br>

God already knows. But notice—even though God knows what your needs are, you still have to ask Him. You just don't need to get too specific or spend too much time doing so.</p>
<h3>
3. Labourers For The Harvest
</h3>
<p> <font color= "blue">
Matt 9 illustrates the third thing for which believers are to pray: 
Then He said to His disciples, The harvest truly is plentiful, but the labourers are few; Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out labourers into His harvest.” (Matt 9:37-38)</font><br>
In these Scriptures, Jesus is talking about His harvest. Can you guess what the harvest is? The harvest is God's people.

Labourers plant the seed of God's Word into the hearts of men. They water the seed and till the ground, and God brings the harvest. God will anoint men or women to preach the gospel.

Then, those men and women can harvest the crop through the power of the Holy Ghost as they seek God and ask Him to move in the earth.

So God wants us to do Matt 9:38: "Therefore pray the Lord of the harvest to send out labourers into His harvest." That's how you scripturally pray for the lost—that labourers will be anointed by God to bring just the right message to them.</p>
<h3>
4. Pray For God's Servants 
</h3>
<p>
We can find the fourth thing to pray for in Eph 6:</p>
<p> <font color= "blue">
Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints; and for me, that utterance may be given to me, that I may open my mouth boldly to make known the mystery of the gospel. (Eph 6:18-19)</font></p>
<p>
In Eph 6:19, Paul said, "Pray for me too." Now, that's the preacher telling the congregation to pray for him. That's not a bad thing to ask for.
Paul also said to pray "that utterance may be given to me." Utterance is the manifested anointed speech of the Holy Ghost. You see, my words aren't going to get the job done. What changes lives are not my words; it is that utterance from the Holy Ghost.</p>
<h3>
5. Pray For The Saints 
</h3>
<p>
The Apostle Paul, writing under the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, said, "Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit, being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints" (Eph. 6:18).

In this verse of Scripture, we find the fifth prayer item: supplication in the spirit for the saints of God.

Note the word supplication in Eph. 6:18. It does not say intercession. In the past, we've included everything under the umbrella of intercession. No, you intercede for the lost, but you supplicate in the Spirit for the saints.</p>
<p>
Praying in the Spirit is praying in other tongues (1 Cor 14:2, 4). When you pray in the Spirit for someone, the Holy Ghost takes hold with you to pray, and He will pray the perfect will of God about the matter (Rom 8:26-28).</p>
<p>
I believe one reason why negative things happen to believers is because of their failure to pray for the saints. Eph 6:18 also gives insight into another reason why negative things happen to believers: "...  being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints."

Believers should be watching for opportunities to pray for others, and this may not be a one-time thing. It may take days, weeks, or months to get a release or a note of victory about the person or people for whom you are praying.

If saints don't pray for other saints, there won't be the protection they need or there won't be a manifestation of the power of God in their lives. Many saints are messed up because other saints are not praying for them.

You see, when saints pray, blessings happen. So, spend time supplicating in the Spirit and praying the "Ephesians Prayer" for the saints (Eph. 1:16-23).</p>
<p>
Now let's go to James 5:
<p><font color= "blue">
Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing psalms. Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much. (James 5:13-16)</font> <br>
In James 5:16, we are told to confess our faults to one another, not before the whole congregation. Then, we are told to pray for one another. Why?

So that we may be healed. Saints should be close enough to one another where they can confess their faults and pray for one another. If you don't pray for one another, you won't be healed.</p>
<h3>
6. Pray For Those In Authority
</h3>
<p> 
Now, let's go to the sixth area to pray for found in 1 Tim 2:1-2: 
I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men; For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.
Verse two really tells you who the "all men" in verse one are: For kings and for all that are in authority. Today, we would say to pray for presidents, prime ministers, members of parliament etc. and for others who are in authority over us.

If they're saved, then you supplicate in the spirit for them. If they are unsaved, then you intercede for them. Verse two tells you why to do this: that we, the saints, may lead a quiet and peaceable life.

It's in our best interest to pray for these people mentioned because the decisions they make are going to have an affect on all of us.</p>
<h3>
7. Is Any Sick Among You?
</h3>
<p> 
The last thing we need to look at in the area of prayer is found in James 5: </p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. (James 5:14)</font>
You don't have to be sick. Did you hear what I said? You don't have to be sick. That's why they're asking the question in James 5:14.

You see, back then, they recognised there didn't have to be any sick among them. You don't have to die sickly; healing has been provided for you. But there's something even beyond healing that's been provided for you—the ability to walk in divine health.

I'm going to close with this. I have seen Christians get attacked with a disease, and they don't want the saints to know about it. James 5:16 says,
<p>
"Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much." (James 5:16)</p>
<p>
Now tell me, how are you going to confess your faults if nobody knows you're sick? That's pride. You know what goes before a fall? Pride. There is no shame that the devil attacked your body. In fact, when you get in trouble, what you need to do is let the saints know immediately.

This is what you say: "This is what the doctor's words were...." They are not your words, they're the doctor's words. Your words are: "By His stripes I am healed!"

You don't have to adopt the words of the doctor. Yes, you may take the doctor's pill, but while you're doing that, also take God's pill. Keep saying the word. <font color= "blue">Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God (Rom 10:17).</font></p>
<h3>
Act On The Word 
</h3>
<p>
Jesus wants us to bear fruit from our prayer lives. If you act on the seven things to pray for given in this article, you will be one of God's fruit-bearers, thus allowing Him to move in the earth as He pleases.

So pray, pray, pray! Be diligent because the earnest, heartfelt, continued prayer of a righteous man makes tremendous power available, and that power is dynamic in its working. Glory to God!</p>
