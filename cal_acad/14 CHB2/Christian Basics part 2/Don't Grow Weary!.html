   <h1>
Don't Grow Weary!
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
“And let us not grow weary while doing good, for in due season we will reap if we do not lose heart” (Gal 6:9)</font>.</p>
<p>
This is not about tired; it is about weary. Weary is spiritual. Although tired and weary may at times feel closely related, they are worlds apart. Tired is physical; weary is spiritual.</p>
<p>
When you are tired you are dealing with the physical realm. Being tired means you need physical rest or a break, some sleep and quite possibly a vacation. Weary does not respond to the same treatment as tired. You can go away for a month to rest and relax but you may still be weary.</p>
<p>
If you are tired you may need to change some life habits. You may need to begin to exercise or exercise differently. Perhaps you have a physical problem that needs medical attention. The point is, tired is physical. You cannot pray tired away. You do not rebuke tired. You cannot lay hands on someone and cast out tired.</p>
<p>
The Greek word translated “weary” is ekkakeó. It is used in the sense of being in the midst of misfortune, to be unfortunate, desperate; it is often translated “to lose heart.”</p>
<p>
If you are weary, you have in the past or are now experiencing some upheaval or crisis in your life that has damaged you, and you have not yet recovered. Each of us has had these places in our lives—places of difficulty, despair, discouragement, disillusionment and disappointment. In some of these places we have given up, thrown up our hands and quit when we should have pressed in to success.</p>
<p>
If we would have persevered, we could have realised the harvest from the seed we had invested in that relationship, job, venture or idea. However, we became weary in the battle and fell into the trap, thus throwing up our hands, giving up and walking away. We lose heart and quit. But according to Gal 6:9 we do not have to quit or give in. We can get the strength we need from God to lay aside the extra weight and carry on into victory.</p>
<p>
A truly satisfied life comes from knowing you have maximized all that God has for you—and He has so much for you to enjoy. He has an abundant life for you—already paid for. It is in His plan to help you through whatever it is so that you can know going through it that you are doing all you can to claim every promise and every blessing He has for you, including a successful marriage, a satisfying career, fulfilled relationships with family and friends, financial peace and much more.</p>
<p>
Reaping implies that you have sown. Consider how much of your life you have spent sowing. A lot of it, to be certain, more than you may realise. <br>Think about it: You have good seed in the ground. You have loved, you have given, you have stood strong, you have prayed and you have been faithful.<br> That is all good seed.</p>
<p>
So guess what? You have a harvest on the way! Don’t quit! The moment you give up is the moment you walk away from your harvest. If you could look at the span of your life on a map, you would see that down the road in your future your harvest is springing up!</p>
<p>
If you have given your life to Christ and have received Him as your personal Saviour then the jury is in on your eternal destiny. You will spend eternity with Christ. However, the jury is still out on how much heaven you will experience while on earth. That will be determined in a large sense by how much and what you sow.</p>
<p>
So when Paul speaks of being weary, he is not concerned with us losing our eternal life with Christ. He’s concerned about our earthly life, that we do not lose our harvest. “Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we do not lose heart” (Gal 6:9).</p>
<p>
Don’t let Satan keep you from realising your full potential. Shut the door to the enemy and open doors of blessing and prosperity over your life.</p>
