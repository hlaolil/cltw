Managing our Shopping
</h1>
<p>
Every household budget has to include groceries and one of the best ways to stretch your budget is to save money on your groceries.</p>
<p>
Here are some great tips on how to save money on your monthly grocery bill without having to make sacrifices.</p>
<h3>
House brands
</h3>
<p>
Opt for the house brand.
Check product prices carefully. About 90% of the time, the house (no-name) brand version of the product you’re buying will be cheaper; so opt for those instead of their more expensive, branded counterparts. 
Unlike what many believe, house brands aren’t necessarily of inferior quality. The large supermarket chains stake their reputation on the quality of these products, so a comparative standard will certainly be maintained</p>
<h3>
Promotions win
</h3>
<p>
The times when the house brand is not cheapest is when there’s a promotion on a particular brand.

Always keep an eye out for promotions and stock up if the deal is really good and the items are non-perishable.</p>
<h3>
Always check prices
</h3>
<p>
Some people are loyal to a particular brand and will opt for that brand without even checking the price. However, if you want to maximise your grocery budget, you need to be checking the prices of all goods every time.
If you’re really stuck on a specific brand of shampoo, investigate alternative options that may be cheaper. If you don’t like the cheaper brand after all, you can always go back to the one you preferred. But you’ll never know unless you try.

Promotions
</h3>
<p>
Don’t be tempted by those 3-for-the-price-of-2 promotions
You know those specials you see, where for example, you buy 2 and get 1 free? These deals are clever marketing ploys that lead you into believing that you’re getting more value for your money. 
The trick here is to work out the price per individual item and ask yourself how many of that particular item you would buy if it were marked at that price.
<h3>
Watch out for rewards traps
</h3>
<p>
Don’t fall for those rewards tricks
The rewards programmes available at the major supermarket chains may provide value when used for something you would have bought anyway. 
If however, you find yourself wanting to buy something, just to get the double and triple points on offer, please reconsider!
A good general rule by which you should abide, is not to buy something just to get the points in rewards. As mentioned in the previously, only buy what you really need. 
If a R100 bottle of olive oil at Pick ‘n Pay offers double points, that means you’re getting R2 instead of R1 back. If the competing product is more than R2 cheaper, it’s better to go for that.
Always use your rewards points as soon as possible.
Something could happen which prevents you from using them in the future, or the value could be diluted due to price increases.</p>
<h3>
Bulk buying
</h3>
<p>
Buy non-perishables in bulk (but not products you don’t know)

If you see a great deal on something that you will always use, such as toilet paper, buy a few packs. But be careful about doing this for items with which you are unfamiliar.

You may take advantage of a special on a new brand of cling-wrap, only to find it doesn’t work well and you have to throw away the extras you bought.</p>
<h3>
Quality is worth the investment
</h3>
<p>
Cheapest is not always the way to go.
Buying dish washing liquid that doesn’t work well, means you will use much more than you would if you used a more expensive but more effective brand.</p>
<h3>
Every little bit counts
</h3>
<p>
Some savings may appear minor, a few cents here, a few rand there, but it all adds up.

If you can save 10% of your grocery bill each month, that saving will add up to a substantial amount over time.</p>
<h3>
Don’t buy things you don’t need
</h3>
<p>
It may sound like common sense to only purchase what is necessary, but stores are designed to entice you into buying things you don’t need. 
The checkout aisle is the most obvious example, with rows and rows of colourful sweets, magazines and other appealing goods. Next time you’re waiting at the till, resist the urge to get that new chocolate you’ve never tried before. Not only will your wallet thank you, but your body will too.</p>
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
Investing a little extra time into your shopping so that you can compare prices and options will be worth it in the long run.</p>
