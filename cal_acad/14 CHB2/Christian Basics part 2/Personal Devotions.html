Personal Devotions
</h1>
<h3>
Devotions are Key to our Christian walk.
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.<br> (2 Tim 4:7)</font></p>
<p>
Could Paul just have gotten up one day and become an Apostle, with no discipleship or mentoring or focusing on Christ? Could a person who wants to be a runner just decide to enter the Olympics without ever running before? <br>Can you be an "instant" athlete? Have you ever seen a world-class sports competitor or a concert musician just wake up one day and perform without any prior practice or learning-just do it? See my point?</p>
<p>
Well most anyone can enter a race or play ball of pick up a violin.<br>They may know the rudimental aspects of it, but can they play with passion and with a degree of expertise? The answer is obvious: no. <br>It is the same with our faith. We have it when we receive Christ; we have His Word and countless resources, helps, and experienced people who have gone before us. We will instantly know a lot, but we are limited in what we really can do, and our full capacity and capability are lurking beneath, waiting on us to learn and exercise our faith so we can be built up. We can't just wait, either to be discovered or for the perfect opening; we have to train and be strengthened first!</p>
<p>
Knowing our Lord and His precepts is also a process that we do not attain overnight. Just like learning or studying any subject, it takes time. <br>If you try getting a good grade in class without studying the subject, without attending class, without taking notes, without doing your homework, and/or without reading the textbook, how well will you do in that class? <br>What if you do some of the requirements, say you attend the class but take no notes or read the textbook; how well will you do? Even if you are very smart? Let's say you do everything well, attend all the classes, take careful notes, do your homework, but never bother opening the textbook; how well will you do then?</p>
<p>
This is how most Christians live their Christian walk. Either they ignore all the "work," do just a couple of things, or maybe do it all, but never read the Bible, how good will they be as a disciple? God may not give us grades and gold stars now, but He does have a plan for us with a reward at the end. He also wants to use us in the here and now! There are some key principles to being a committed disciple, such as prayer, personal Bible study (like quite time with the Bible and good Christian literature), attending a good church for fellowship and discipleship, and group Bible study; these are aspects of our devotions. <br>And when we do just some, none, or leave out just one, we will become weak, and falter in our walk with our Lord, thus, missing out on the opportunities He has for us in service, growth, maturity, character, contentment, faith development, being used to affect others, personal enrichment, and of course, glorying our Lord.</p>
<p>
If you do not attend a good church or do any personal devotions, and then expect to be used and even blessed by God, you will find disappointment.<br> If you are just doing 2 of the 5 key principles of being a disciple, but you are not communicating with God, you will find yourself "running on empty," headed for discouragement. If you spend all of your time in fellowship and do little to no learning or on your knees in prayer, and do not read His Word, you will falter. You cannot be a mature Christian unless you have all five of these principles working. Without being in God's Word, you will not mature in the faith and/or grow in His knowledge. Without prayer, you will not be communicating with Him. Without fellowship, you will not be honed or accountable or used to impact others. Without being in a good church, you will not have the avenues for Christian education, learning, accountability, discipleship, or a place to serve. You must do all five: personal Bible study, prayer, church fellowship, discipleship, and group Bible study to be a mature disciple that God will use greatly. Your devotional life hones it all.</p>
<h3>
What are we doing instead of Devotions?
</h3>
<p>
One of the main problems created when some Christians "go bad" in their motives and behaviours is that they forget who they are. This is how and why pastors fall, marriages fail, and churches split or close. Too many people who go to church have not a clue of what it is about. Perhaps they once did when the excitement of their new birth in Christ was fresh and they were growing.<br>But now the noise, stress, and busyness of life take over the time slot that was originally reserved for God. Perhaps, our time and excitement of church become clouded, preventing us from remembering what it is supposed to be about. <br>So we forget whose we are and what we are called to do. Our focus on Christ becomes blurred as we add other things to it, like our circumstances, desires, hurts, and/or pains, or can even be stopped by our anger, bitterness, and/or fears.</p>
<p>
Thus, week by week we hurry ourselves around, dragging the family to go to church, living through the tyranny of the daily grind of life, then sitting in our pews, trying to recover from the exhaustion, hoping our struggle is not in vain. Thus, we give little effort to understanding what the words mean when we sing a hymn, what the pastor is talking about at the pulpit, or the beauty of the liturgy and the power and conviction of the words from the Word. <br>We are just playing a part in a play without allowing the character to become who we are. Without allowing the purpose of what is going on, the meaning of the service, and the application we are called to respond to get in us, the church and the Christian life become just a routine and not the life impact that Christ created for us to emanate.</p>
<p>
Another problem we have today is that most people (what I think includes most Christians), do not know the reasons and importance of theology and the role of Scripture, including growing in faith. People cannot discern who God is (theology), when or how God works (discipleship), what He has to tell us, or what we should know until He tells us (spiritual growth). <br>The Lord tells us who He is and reveals His will to us through the authority of His Word (John 5:39; 2 Tim 3:16 and Heb 4:12). These Scriptures testify to the importance and role and power of the Bible, that the Bible is the supreme authority of faith, practice, and duty for all Christians.</p> 
<p>
There is no higher authority, either ecclesiastical or personal, that can take the place of God's Word. A conservative, strong position on biblical inspiration is imperative to the effective Bible teacher. Without this view of authority, we elevate ourselves above God and we become the means of faith and practice rather than the Creator of the universe. The Bible is "wholly true." <br>The Scriptures themselves testify this by the test of time, and even by testimony, science, and higher criticism. Not having the authority of Scripture is like having a view of Christianity without Christ.</p>
<h3>
Looking beyond Ourselves
</h3>
<p>
There are times when I am doing my devotions that I journal, that is, keep a diary of what is going on in my life. I sometimes look back on that and gain new insight on what I was going through that I did not have back then.<br> I have become more adept at interpreting God's leading and plan for me as I further experience life and receive what He has done. By looking back on what we have been through and seeing the hand of God there, we can have greater comfort and encouragement for what we are going through now or what lies ahead. As I gain new insight into my personality and the Lord's working into my issues and problems, I realise what shadows they are compared to my Lord's holiness and greatness.</p>
<p>
Concentrating on Christ and what He has done will lift us up better and more completely than anything else we could ever do. The focus of journalling has taught me to look beyond myself and concentrate on Christ. The other end of journalling or devotions is a problem that people, including Christians, experience; in their zeal to keep faithful to their spiritual chronicle, it becomes an end to itself. The effort becomes self absorbed; people tend to only see themselves and their problems, and not the Lord and what He has for them to learn and do. So, be careful when you exercise your devotions.<br> Keep focused on why you are doing it, which is to grow closer to the Lord and not just for yourself.</p>
<p>
We are called to keep our focus on Him and not on us. We look at God's Word as a mirror to ourselves, to our soul, not to see us, but to see God working in us. When we only see ourselves, we see sin, brokenness, failure, self-seeking inclinations, and wrong attitudes. We must see God's interests and not our own; then our devotions and journalling become tools of maturing in the faith. <br>Christ will become more real in us; as our problems become less, He becomes more (John 3:30).</p>
<p>
The same thing can happen when we read the Word. We can become so consumed with our interests, we do not see the calling and response we are to give. Thus, we grow bitter, thinking that this devotion stuff is not for me, so we turn it off. We replace it with so much activity that God is pushed out of our lives-except on Sunday mornings. But even then, we are rushed and stressed and do not feel the worship or hear the lesson. We only hear ourselves-our problems of getting the kids ready, or the stress at work or school.<br> The results of a mature life will respond from the impact of our devotional life, and by applying what Christ has done.</p>
<p>
To overcome our spiritual deadness, we need to respond to our Lord through His text with a surrendered will and a mind cleared of anxious thoughts. <br>When we are focused on our fears, hopes, dreams, needs, or emotions, we leave no room to learn what God has for us. We will not be able to think deeply enough into the Bible so a transformation of our nature and will occurs, what philosophers call our "existential core." There can be no serious behaviour or personality changes unless the core of who we are changes. <br>And Christ is the only one who does that right!</p>
<p>
This transformation is found in Rom 12, in Heb 11 and 12, and in many other places too, yet it cannot happen when we are in the way. God does as He pleases, but He usually does not override our will. He waits for us to be surrendered and poured out to Him.<br> So, do not take the chance and allow your stubbornness to get in the way of God working in you (Gal 2:20-21; 5:16-26; Phil 3:1-14)!</p>
<h3>
Access to the Presence of God
</h3>
<p>
What does it mean for your faith that you have clear, uninhibited access to the presence of God at any time?
Well, you do! The bottom line is this: devotions are very important and if you want to grow in the faith and be better used by God and be more joyful in life, you need to do them, plain and simple! <br>In this way, as Heb 11 tells us, we will not grow weary or be faint hearted, that is, we can press on and receive our strength from Christ (Prov 3:11-12).</p>
<p>
Take comfort: this is easy and do-able! We are not alone in this journey of faith; we have a great multitude of those who have gone before us upon whose shoulders we stand. Great men and women of the faith have one key component in common: they all do devotions. They read the Bible, pray, study, fellowship, and are discipled; and they are consistent with it. Their focus is on Christ.<br> They know that Christ can be trusted. We can have a thriving faith in Him regardless of what we have been through in the past or will face in the future. Since others have trusted in Christ and thrived in heinous conditions with jubilation, then so can we. We are able to throw off whatever hinders and slows us down, and have our sins removed so we can not only enter the race and run it, but keep running it, finish it, and even win it!<br> Our focus is the key; and to keep our focus we need to be devoted.</p>
<p>
Devotions are the prime tools to making this happen. This is really simple to do; we keep our focus on the prize and reason, on our purpose and who goes before us - Christ as Lord - as all that we have and are, our faith, and our lives depend on Him. As we read the Bible, pray, study, fellowship, and are being discipled, then we can mediate on His precepts and practice His Presence by our simple trust and obedience just as Jesus personally showed us. He proved Himself by being willing to die for us; so we can live for Him. This gives us great joy and purpose. Just think about all that Christ did and endured for you.<br> Now think about how you will live in response. Get to know Him more! <br>Your gratitude will be your fuel, so you do not become weary or give up life or the fight against sin and the let downs of life. <br>Do your devotions and do so joyfully, for the benefits are tremendous!</p>
<p>
So, let us run with perseverance the race marked out for us!</p>
