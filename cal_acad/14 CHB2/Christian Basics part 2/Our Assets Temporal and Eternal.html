   <h1>
Our Assets Temporal and Eternal
</h1>
<p>
If we want to accurately calculate how much we are really worth, we need to utilise three entirely different types of “valuation methods.”</p>
<h3>
Valuation Method 1
</h3>
<p>
We need to value our life worth rather than our net worth.<br>
The last thing we should want to do is spend our lives climbing the ladder of success only to realise once we finally do reach the top that our ladder is leaning against the wrong wall. And all that we really wanted in life we do not have and all we do have is not what we really want.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Jesus told us, “... for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses.” (Luke 12:15)</font>.</p>
<p> 
He adds in the parable of the sower, <font color= "blue">“... the deceitfulness of riches and the desires for other things entering in choke the word ...” (Mark 4:19)</font>. </p>
<p>
If you are valuing your net worth more than your life worth, you are indeed climbing up the wrong ladder.</p>
<p>
So what is your life worth? Paul reminds us, <font color= "blue">“But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us” (Rom 5:8)</font>.</p>
<p>
John adds, <font color= "blue">“Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we would be called children of God!” (1 John 3:1)</font>.  This glorious truth makes us exceedingly valuable.</p>
<p>
Our real worth in this life will never be found in the stuff we collect; it will be found in the fact that we personally know the Owner!</p>
<p>
Using Valuation Method 1, what are you really worth?</p>
<h3>
Valuation Method 2
</h3>
<p>
We need to value our internal acquisitions rather than our external acquisitions</p>
<p>
Paul addresses just how important it is to be pursuing internal, spiritual acquisitions and not material, external ones. He says, <font color= "blue">“But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many foolish and harmful lusts which drown men in destruction  and perdition. For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils, for which some have strayed from the faith in their greediness, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.  But you, O man of God, flee these things [external acquisitions] and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, gentleness.” [internal acquisitions] (1 Tim 6:9-11)</font>.</p>
<p>
Peter goes on to specifically encourage women to focus on internal, spiritual acquisitions and not external, material ones when he instructs them,<br> <font color= "blue">“Do not let your adornment be merely outward—arranging the hair, wearing gold, or putting on fine apparel— rather let it be the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious in the sight of God.” (1 Peter 3:3-4)</font>. </p>
<p>
How diligently are you seeking to internally acquire the mind and nature of Christ?  This is what Peter says is “precious [valuable] in the sight of God.”</p>
<p>
There is no more poignant expression of the folly of valuing what we are worth by our external, material acquisitions instead of by our internal, spiritual ones than when Jesus confronts the Laodiceans. He exposes them saying,<br> <font color= "blue">“Because you say, "I am rich, have become wealthy, and have need of nothing"—and do not know that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked— (Rev 3:17)</font>.</p> 
<p>
The Laodiceans were valuing the wrong balance sheet. This is what will happen to us, if we choose to calculate what we are worth based upon our external acquisitions instead of our internal ones. We must understand this, “What the world esteems greatly [external acquisitions], God disregards and what God esteems greatly [internal acquisitions], the world disregards.”</p>
<p>
Using Valuation Method 2, what are you really worth?</p>
<h3>
Valuation Method 3
</h3>
<p>
We need to value our eternal assets rather than our temporal assets</p>
<p>
The Bible is very clear that our temporal assets will do us no good after we leave this planet.  Solomon tells us (and he ought to know),<font color= "blue"> “Riches do not profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death.” (Prov 11:4)</font>.</p>
<p>
Jesus reminds us that even a temporal balance sheet that would include everything on earth is still wholly worthless on the judgement day.  He tells us,<font color= "blue"> “For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?” (Mark 8:36)</font></p>
<p>
Because of this, Jesus commands us,<font color= "blue"> “Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth ... [temporal assets], but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven ...” [eternal assets] (Matt 6:19-20)</font>.</p>
<p>
Receiving rewards (treasures) in heaven is not taught in most churches.<br> But the Bible is very clear that even though our salvation cannot be earned by any good works, our “rewards in heaven” will be directly tied to our good works. Twenty-nine times the Greek word for rewards is used in the New Testament.  Here are some of the ways the New Testament tells us to grow our eternal assets (rewards/treasures) in heaven: accepting persecution (Matt 5:10-12), loving our enemies (Luke 6:35), giving generously (Matt 6:2-4), praying <br>(Matt 6:6), fasting (Matt 6:18), showing hospitality (Matt 10:41), showing kindness towards others (Mark 9:41), doing good deeds (1 Cor 3:10, Col 3:24,), and sharing our faith (1 Cor 3:8, 1 Cor 9:17-18).</p>
<p>
When we calculate what we are worth, are we looking at what we have here and now or what we will have then and there? What we keep now, we will lose forever and what we lose now, we will keep forever.</p>
<p>
How much would you be worth if you were to eternally relocate today?  <br>This question ought to give all of us cause to pause and reflect.</p>
<p>
Using Valuation Method 3, what are you really worth?</p>
<p>
If we want to know how much we are really worth, we cannot use the world’s valuation methods because they are inaccurate and misleading and will only provide us with a distorted sense of worth.  God’s valuation methods, on the other hand, are true and accurate and by utilising them as our standard measure of worth, we can be sure that in God’s economy, we can be indeed rich in both this life and the next, regardless of what our current balance sheet may show.</p>
