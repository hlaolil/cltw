  <h1>
Honouring the Lord
</h1>
<h3>
Honouring His Word
</h3>
<p>
The word honour means to carry weight, to weigh down, to make heavy.<br> Now, the Bible tells us that God and His Word are one (John 1:1). <br>So, honouring God means that His Word weighs heavy in your life.<br> No matter what anyone else says, or what’s going on around you, nothing will influence you more than God's Word. His “logos” Word carries weight with you, and His “rhema” Word carries weight with you. Logos is His written Word, the Bible. His rhema words are those words spoken to you by the Holy Spirit.<br> This means His Word weighs heavy upon the decisions you make, the actions you take, even in the words you speak. So when there's a decision you have to make, you honour God by saying, “Alright, Lord, in this decision, what does Your Word have to say about this?” </p>
<h3>
Honouring Him by giving and tithing
</h3>
<p>
Now, how is giving and tithing an act of honour to God?  The Bible tells us: <font color= "blue">“Honour the Lord with your possessions, and with the first fruits of all your increase;” (Prov 3:9)</font><br>
We’ve already established that we honour God when we allow His Word to weigh heavier than anything else in our lives. But this scripture instructs us to honour the Lord with our possessions. <br>
But, how do you honour the Lord with your capital or money? The same way you would honour your mother and father. You give them authority to speak into your life, and as an act of honour, you obey them. That's what honour means. When you honour God with your substance, you give Him the authority to speak to you concerning your money.<br> 
You’ve given it to me, and I’ll cheerfully give it back to you, because I’m your faithful steward!”<br>
<font color= "blue">“Give, and it will be given to you: good measure, pressed down, shaken together, and running over will be put into your bosom. For with the same measure that you use, it will be measured back to you.” (Luke 6:38).</font></p>
<p>
Does God’s Word weigh heavy in your life? When His Word is the final authority in your life, it becomes a privilege to honour Him with your substance or capital.</p>
