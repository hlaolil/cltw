<h1>
The Trap of Self-sufficiency 
</h1>
<p>
Life can present us with challenges and decisions that are not easy to make on our own.  We may pray about the situation and read God’s Word for guidance, but still feel confused and uncertain about the direction we should take.  In these times it can be helpful to seek the counsel of other wise and godly people.</p>
<h3>
Receiving Wise and Godly Counsel
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Where there is no counsel, the people fall; but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety. (Prov 11:14)</font></p>
<p>	
Two things the Bible makes very clear are the benefit of godly counsel and the detriment of ungodly counsel. <font color= "blue"> “The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of the wicked are deceitful.” (Prov 12:5)</font> Therefore it is imperative when seeking counsel that we examine the character and values of the person(s) of whom we receive advice.</p>
 <p>
Not only are one’s character and values of utmost importance, we must also factor in a person’s motives when evaluating the merit of their advice.  Receiving advice from a person who has a vested interest or potential gain from the decision we make can lead us astray.   The more subtle, but equally misleading advice can come from people who care about us, but give advice based on their own fears, insecurities or expectations.  For example, a situation that would require complete reliance and dependence upon the Lord may make a family member or friend uneasy and unwilling to support.  It is therefore imperative to seek advice from people who know and love God, seek His will and will be impartial to our circumstances and faithful to the truth of God's Word.</p>
<p> 
Instead of relying on the sole advice of one person, it is at times best to hear from several godly people and assess the direction of the Lord by understanding where there is consensus and harmony.  When the early church was challenged with a question of doctrine that was causing dissension and dispute, they decided to come together to consider the matter collectively.  
(Acts 15:6) “Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of counsellors there is safety.” (Prov 11:14)
It is particularly wise to receive counsel from an extended group of confidants when considering major changes in life or when facing significant life battles.<font color= "blue"> “For by wise counsel you will wage your own war: and in a multitude of counsellors there is safety.” (Prov 24:6)</font></p>
 <p>
When we receive counsel from a group of people, we cannot assume that the majority is always right.  Upon the Lord’s directive, Moses sent spies into the Land of Canaan to see what the land was like and whether the people in the land were strong or weak.  After forty days, the spies came back and reported that the land “truly flows with milk and honey”, but that the people in the land were too strong to overtake.  Only Joshua and Caleb had faith to believe that the land could be conquered.  (read Num 13:1-14:10)
<font color= "blue">“A wise man will hear, and increase learning; and a man of understanding will attain wise counsel.” (Prov 1:5)</font></p>
<p>
Therefore as we weigh out the counsel we receive from others we need to ask ourselves the question, “Does this advice fit the character and nature of God as portrayed in the Bible?”  We should test to see whether the counsel we receive is true and honest, just, pure, loving, of good report and would glorify God. (Phil 4:8)</p>
 <p>
Seeking wise counsel is a sign of maturity and humility. “A wise man will hear, and increase learning; and a man of understanding will attain wise counsel." (Prov 1:5)  Learning to discern the difference between wise and poor counsel requires discernment and reliance upon God’s Word (Psa 1:1-2) and the Holy Spirit (John 16:13).<font color= "blue"> “Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world.“(1 John 4:1)</font> 
Ultimately, our trust should never be in the people who give the advice, but in God who through His Holy Spirit can use people to give us wisdom and assist us along the path of life.</p>
