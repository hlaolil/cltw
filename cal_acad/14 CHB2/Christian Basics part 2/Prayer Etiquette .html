Prayer Etiquette 
</h1>
<p>
The precise and correct knowledge of God's will comes through two means: proper prayer, and the reading and study of the Scriptures. <br>The two are inseparable in the Christian life.</p>
<p>
What do we mean by "proper prayer"? It is important to understand that the Scriptures themselves teach us how to pray. Proper prayer is not the rote repetition of set prayers, nor does it mean approaching God in any way we wish. Scripture rejects both extremes. The Lord Jesus Himself has given believers a model for their praying, in Matthew chapter six:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.<br>
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.<br>
Give us this day our daily bread.<br>
And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.<br>
And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil:<br> 
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.<br> (Matt 6:9-13)</font></p>
<h3>
Not "The Lord's Prayer"
</h3>
<p>
Before we begin studying this model prayer, we need to state that it is unfortunate that this prayer has become generally known as "The Lord's Prayer". If there is any prayer in Scripture that merits such a title, it is the high priestly prayer of the Lord Jesus in John 17. It would be far more accurate to call the prayer in Matt 6 "the believer's model prayer." This is the pattern given by Christ to believers for their own prayer to the Father.</p>
<h3>
Jesus' Preamble to the Prayer
</h3>
<p>
It is important to read and understand the preamble by which Jesus introduces this model prayer:<br>
<font color= "blue">
And when you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites. For they love to pray standing in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men. Assuredly, I say to you, they have their reward. But you, when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. And when you pray, do not use vain repetitions as the heathen do. For they think that they will be heard for their many words. Therefore do not be like them. For your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him. In this manner, therefore, pray: ... (Matt 6:5-9)</font></p>
<h3>
Four Characteristics of Proper Prayer
</h3>
<p.
The main theme of Jesus' preamble is that our praying is to be different from the futile praying of unbelievers. And for that reason, in the preamble He makes four points about what prayer is - and just as importantly, what it is not.</p>
<p>
First, Jesus tells us that prayer is primarily a private matter (Matt 6:5-6) - the believer with God the Father, one to one. This is not to say there is no place for public prayer or corporate prayer; Scripture gives us many examples of both. But the primary focus of prayer is the individual Christian meeting with his God.</p>
<p>
Second, Jesus tells us that the kind of prayer that God desires from us is extemporaneous (Carried out or performed with little or no preparation; impromptu) (Matt 6:7). Nowhere in the Bible are we told to repeat "set prayers". This was one of the things that many of the Protestant Reformers opposed, and we should do likewise. We are commanded here not to use "vain repetitions." We have those kinds of "vain repetitions" in the present day - for example, the Roman Catholics use the rosary, and the Buddhists use prayer wheels.</p>
<p>
In fact, Roman Catholicism makes the repetition of set prayers, and the prayer of Matt 6 in particular, a matter of penance. They make it a saving work. <br>In the confessional booth the priest tells the Catholic, "Because you have committed this kind of sin, you need to say this many Hail Mary's and this many Our Fathers in order to pay for your sin." The number of repetitions varies according to the supposed severity of the sin. True Christians, trusting in the full sufficiency of Christ's atonement for sin, must thoroughly reject such ineffectual substitutes for the all-sufficient blood of Christ.</p>
<p>
Third, Jesus tells us that quality in prayer is more important than quantity<br> (Matt 6:7). This is not to say that we should not spend adequate time in prayer, but how we pray is the important thing. And as we pray properly, we will want to make more and more of a priority of prayer, and devote more time to it.</p>
<p>
And fourth, Jesus tells us that we need to keep one thing at the forefront of our thoughts: Remember to whom you are praying (Matt 6:8). You are not praying, as the pagans believed and as the Pharisees and Sadducees had come to believe, to an arbitrary or even despotic deity, or to someone without perfect knowledge. You are praying to the omniscient Father who has perfect knowledge of your needs. He has your best interests at heart.</p>
<h3>
Not a Prayer to be Prayed, But a Model for Prayer
</h3>
<p>
With these things in mind as a preamble, the Lord Jesus then instructs us as to how we are to pray: <font color= "blue">"In this manner, therefore, pray: ..." (Matt 6:9)</font> <br>The force of the Greek is, "pray after this pattern." In other words, "in your own extemporaneous praying, be sure to approach God in this way." The force of the Greek is not, "repeat these words" - and Matt 6:7 reinforces that thought. Praying is not a matter of repeating certain words, not even the words we find here in Matthew.</p>
<p>
Instead, Jesus says, "in this manner, therefore, pray." Jesus is saying that in light of the points He has just taught about the nature of proper prayer, and about the God to whom we pray, this is how we are to pray.</p>
<h3>
How Do You Pray?
</h3>
<p>
Christian, how do you pray? Do you make a priority of prayer? Do you have a way, and do you make a time and a place, to get alone with your heavenly Father to spend regular, uninterrupted time in prayer? Scripture mentions prayer over 400 times. God's Word places a priority on prayer.<br> We need to place a priority on prayer.</p>
<p>
Do you pray from the heart? Do you pray extemporaneously? It is easy for us to unthinkingly fall into ruts in prayer. We may not pray a set prayer day after day, and clearly we should avoid it. But we can so easily fall into the same patterns in our own words day after day. Prayer can become almost a robotic, thoughtless kind of activity. We can easily get to the point where we're not thinking very much about how or what we are praying - or to Whom. We need to take the time to express our own heart's reverence and worship for God through prayer. We need to take the time, and use our own words, guided by the Holy Spirit, to express our innermost thoughts and desires to our loving Father.</p>
<h3>
How Did God Become Our Father?
</h3>
<p>
How is it that God, the condemning judge of sinners, has become God our loving Father? It is because those who have been justified by grace through faith in Christ have also been adopted as sons. One of the key passages that presents this wonderful truth is Gal 3 - Gal 4</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. For as many of you as were baptised into Christ [this speaks of Spirit baptism, not water baptism] have put on Christ. There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.<br>
Now I say that the heir, as long as he is a child, does not differ at all from a slave, though he is master of all, but is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father. Even so we, when we were children, were in bondage under the elements of the world. But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons.<br>
And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, "Abba, Father!" [A term of familial endearment.] Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ. (Gal 3:26-29; Gal 4:1-7)</font></p>
<h3>
Why Pray Only to the Father?
</h3>
<p>
Jesus' instructions in Matt 6, in connection with other passages, tell us that the Biblical order for approaching God in prayer is quite specific:<br> We are to pray to the Father, through the Son, and in the Holy Spirit. </p>
<p>
Jesus said to His disciples, <font color= "blue">"Until now you have asked nothing in My name." (John 16:24)</font> </p>
<p>
And there He instructs them to start praying to the Father, in His - Jesus' - name.</p>
<p> 
We are told to pray <font color= "blue">"with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit." (Eph 6:18) </font></p>
<p>
We are also told to be <font color= "blue">building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit," (Jude 1:20)</font></p>
<p>
This is the very definition of prayer: the believer coming before the throne of our Heavenly Father, through the person and finished work of the Son, and in the indwelling Holy Spirit. Everything else the Bible says about prayer hangs on that framework.</p>
<p>
Nowhere in Scripture are we told to pray to Jesus. Nowhere in Scripture are we told to pray to the Holy Spirit. We are told that we are to pray to the Father, through the intercession of the Son, and by the enabling of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h3>
Our Two Great Intercessors
</h3>
<p>
God the Son and God the Holy Spirit are the two greatest prayer warriors on behalf of believers.The passages below tell us about the intercessory work of Christ.<br> 
<font color= "blue">He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them." (Heb 7:25)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"If anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous." (1 John 2:1)</font></p>
<p>
The passages below tells us of the intercessory work of the Holy Spirit on our behalf:<br>
<font color= "blue">
Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God. (Rom 8:26-27)</font></p>
<p>
The Son and the Spirit are our great intercessors, but it is the Father to whom intercession is made.</p> 
<h3>
A New Covenant Privilege
</h3>
<p>
We should note also that "Father" as a name for God is a New Covenant term. The veil has been rent, we come to God the Father directly and confidently - boldly, as Heb 4 tells us - because of what Christ has done and where He now is, seated at the Father's right hand.</p>
<p>
In the Old Testament God is spoken of on a few occasions as the Father, but it is always in relationship to the nation of Israel. "Father" as a name for God in the Old Testament is never a term applied to His relationship with the individual believer. God had many names in the Old Testament. But a Jew of the old dispensation did not call God, "my Father" or "our Father" or pray to "the Father." The revelation of the relationship of God the Father to the individual believer is something new as we come to the New Testament. <br>It is something that is unveiled at the first coming of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>
Throughout the Gospels, Jesus always refers to God as "the Father" or "my Father" and in prayer He always addresses God the Father. <br>This is the pattern Jesus establishes for the New Testament believer.</p>
<p>
Jesus tells us to ask of the Father, to make our requests known to the Father, and that is because a new relationship has been established through the coming of Christ. In the Old Testament the way of approach was always through a Levitical priest and bloody sacrifice. The individual believer had no direct way of approach to God. Only the High Priest could go behind the veil into the very presence of God, and only once a year. But now, with the coming of Christ, that has changed. We have been reconciled to God, we have been adopted as sons, and the way of direct approach to the throne of grace has been opened.<br> It is the Father to whom we have been reconciled through the work of the Son.</p>
<h3>
The Father Only Hears Two Kinds of Prayer
</h3>
<p>
We are on solid Biblical ground when we say that God the Father truly only hears two kinds of prayer: The prayer of the one who calls on His name to be saved, and the prayer of the one who is saved.<br> Unbelievers think they will be heard, but are not - Jesus has made that clear in His preamble, back in Matt 6:7.</p>
<p>
The privilege of prayer is a privilege of grace. The privilege of prayer is the greatest privilege the Christian has. The privilege of prayer is at the very heart of what salvation is all about - that through the death, burial, and resurrection of God the Son, we hopeless sinners have been reconciled to God the Father for eternity. God the Father is no longer the condemning judge; because of Christ our substitute He is now our loving Father.</p>
<h3>
Summing Up
</h3>
<p>
There is so much more we could say on the subject of prayer in general, and on Jesus' model prayer for believers in particular. But as we sum up, let me ask you some questions about your own prayer life. These are questions that all come directly from Jesus' discourse in Matt 6.</p>
<p>
First and foremost, do you make a priority of prayer? Do you make a time and a place for regular fellowship with your heavenly Father? Prayer is mentioned over 400 times in Scripture. God's Word places a priority on prayer. <br>You need to place a priority on prayer.</p>
<p>
Second, do you pray from the heart? Do you pray extemporaneously? <br>It is easy for us to unthinkingly fall into ruts in prayer. You may not pray a set prayer day after day, but you can easily fall into the same patterns of words day after day, so that prayer can become almost a robotic kind of activity.<br> You can easily reach the point where you are really not thinking very much about your praying. Prayer takes time and thought. You need to take the time to express your reverence and worship for God through prayer.<br> You need to take the time to express the thoughts and desires of your heart to God.</p>
<p>
Third, when you pray, do you keep in mind the nature of the God to whom you are praying? Do you pray to the Father, through the Son, and in the Holy Spirit? Do you remember that you are praying to the all-powerful God of the universe, who knows your every need far better than you do, and even before you come to Him? <br>And yet the Father wants you to come. He commands you to come - to<br> <font color= "blue">"pray without ceasing", (1 Thess 5:17)</font> that is, incessantly. <br>He promises <font color= "blue">"grace to help in time of need" (Heb 4:16)</font>.<br> Do you come before the Father in reverence? Do you come to your Father with concern for the holiness of His name? Do you come before God the Father with your relationship in mind? Are you mindful of your great privilege of having been reconciled to God the Father through the blood of Christ? Are you continually reminding yourself that it is on that basis alone that you have the inestimable privilege of coming before Him in prayer?</p>
<p>
Fourth, do you come before God with His kingdom in mind? Is the furtherance of your Father's kingdom at the forefront of your mind as you pray?<br> Do you have His will in mind? Are you willing to submit to His will as you present before the throne of grace your needs and the desires of your heart?</p>
<p>
Fifth, do you come to the Father with an attitude of dependence - the recognition that you are utterly reliant upon Him, that there is nothing you have or ever will have that does not come from the Father's hand?</p>
<p>
Sixth, do you come seeking the Father's protection from the evil one?<br> Do you understand how much you need that protection? Do you understand that you are not on your own in the battle, but that God the Father has made and will make every provision for your rescue from the evil one, both in this present life and for all eternity?
<h3>
Be Convicted - But Not Discouraged
</h3>
<p>
I do not believe that a preacher has really preached to others unless he himself is first convicted by his own message from God. These questions certainly bring conviction to the heart of this writer. Martyn Lloyd-Jones once rightly observed that most preachers find it far easier to preach than to pray. And no doubt, believers in general find it far easier to do a thousand other things in the course of a day than to spend time before the Father in prayer.</p>
<p>
Indeed, the Word of God should convict us about our deficiencies in the matter of prayer. <br>The Word is <font color= "blue">"a discerner (in the original, a critic) of the thoughts and intents of the heart. And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account" <br>(Heb 4:12-13)</font>.</p>
<p>
But Biblical conviction is not designed to bring discouragement. On the contrary, after writing such convicting words, the writer to the Hebrews says,<br> <font color= "blue">
"Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need" (Heb 4:16)</font>.</p>
<h3>
Let Us Therefore Come
</h3>
<p>
In other words, let us come "because these things are so." What things?<br> The writer is saying, let us therefore come, because <font color= "blue">"there remains therefore a rest for the people of God" (Heb 4:9)</font>.<br> Let us therefore come, because we need to cease from reliance on our own works (Heb 4:10).<br> Let us therefore come, because we need to be diligent to enter into our rest in Christ (Heb 4:11).<br> Let us therefore come, because God's Word reveals who we are and what we are (Heb 4:12).<br> Let us therefore come, because God knows us intimately, and we can hide nothing from Him (Heb 4:13).<br> Let us therefore come, because Jesus is a High Priest who can sympathise with our weaknesses (Heb 4:14). <br>Let us therefore come, because Jesus was tempted in all points just as we are, yet without sin (Heb 4:15).<br> Because of all these wondrous facts, let us come!</p>
<h3>
Let Us Come Boldly
</h3>
<p>
And not only that - "let us come boldly". The word that is used here does not mean that we may come brashly, or presumptuously, or without proper respect or reverence. Rather, this word tells us about two aspects of our coming - first, how we may speak to our Lord; and second, the attitude with which we may come before Him.</p>
<p>
The word "boldly" means that you may have freedom in speaking as you approach the Lord. It says that, within the bounds of reverence, you may be unreserved in your speech. You may, and indeed you should, speak to your God openly, frankly, and without concealment.</p>
<p>
The word "boldly" also speaks of your attitude in coming to the throne of grace. It says that you may come with free and fearless confidence; with cheerful courage; with assurance that as a believer in Christ you have the right to come, and God wants you to come to the Father through the Son.<br><font color= "blue">"For Christ has not entered the holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true, but into Heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us." (Heb 9:24)</font></p>
