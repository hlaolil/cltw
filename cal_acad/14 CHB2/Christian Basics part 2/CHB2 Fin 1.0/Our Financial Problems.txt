<p>
The average middle class South African household spends over R7 000 each month  paying off debt, while more than half of South Africans say they will never be financially free.</p> 
<p>
This is according to the first annual Wealth Worries Survey, conducted by global payments technology company Visa. (February 2013)</p>
<p>
According to Visa, the wealth survey is one of the most comprehensive reports into middle class South Africans and their money. </p>  
<p>
“South Africa, and indeed the whole world, has gone through a very tough time over the last few years.</p> 
<p>
"We wanted to assess attitudes to money, flag areas where people are putting themselves at risk and help people grow and protect their wealth,” said Visa country manager for South Africa.</p>
<p>
The report surveyed 2 000 people across the country who have household financial decision-making responsibilities. The report was designed to uncover attitudes and behaviour towards money matters and identify areas where South Africans are putting themselves at risk. </p>
<p>
Asked whether they would ever be financially free, 52% said no, while 46% considered it feasible. Two percent said they already are.</p>
<p>
Of those who think they will one day be financially free, 68% said they would only achieve this after the age of 50.</p> 
<p>
Almost 30% of respondents said debt levels are the biggest threat to their wealth, with 89% saying they pay on average R7 283 per month to service their debt. </p>
<p>
The other threats to their wealth were inflation (19%), the global economy (16%), political uncertainty (14%), employment uncertainty (14%), poor investment returns (5%) and their children (2%).</p> 
<p>
Interestingly, 60 is the average planned retirement age, but 15% say they will never retire. Thirteen percent say they will retire at 50, while 41% say they will retire at 65 or older. </p>
<p>
Eighty seven percent said they would retire in South Africa while 13% favoured retiring abroad, with Europe and the UK the top choices. </p>
<p>
Looking at retirement savings, South Africans have various ways of putting money away for their golden years. Sixty four percent of people have their own retirement annuity or provident fund. </p> 
<p>
Fifty eight percent have a company retirement fund, 25% have property, 15% are investing in their own businesses and 8% said they put money into unit trusts they have chosen themselves. </p>
<p>

<p>
A whopping 53% said property is the asset that most likely would make them wealthy, with 70% saying they owned one property, 12% two properties and 3% two or more properties. </p>
<p>
This was followed by shares and owning your own business, both at 15%, commodities at 8% and private equity investments at 4%.</p>
