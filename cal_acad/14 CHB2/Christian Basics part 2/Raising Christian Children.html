Raising Christian Children
</h1>
<p>
Christian parents face just as many obstacles as non-Christians in raising children. When you add all the distractions and the pressures in today's world, Christian parenting becomes even more than a challenge.</p> 
<p>
A huge part of that challenge is passing on your faith to children whose priorities are more focused on video games, sporting events, and the latest trends in clothes. And let's not forget to mention peer pressure and media pressure that offers temptations to children to do drugs, drink alcohol and get involved sexually. Today's children face an overall absence of godly examples and moral living in a society that is moving toward "freedom from religion" instead of "freedom of religion."</p> 
<p>
But the good news is that there are things you can do to raise godly children and even share your faith with them along the way. </p>
<h3>
Faith
</h3>
<p><font size="+1">
Living Your Faith</font></p>
<p>
First, as a parent you must live out your faith in your own life. It is impossible to give away something you don't have. Children can spot a phony from a mile away. They're looking for the real deal from their parents. 
Living your faith can start with simple things, like showing love, kindness, and generosity.<br> If your children see you finding ways to "be a blessing," it will become a natural and normal way of life for them too.</p> 
<p><font size="+1">
Sharing Your Faith</font></p>
<p>
Second, start sharing your faith early in the lives of your children. Being a part of an active Christian church shows your children that you think spending time with God is important. Make it a point to let them hear you talk about the great things happening in the church. Let them hear how much you've been helped by being in the midst of people with similar beliefs who pray for you and you for them. 
Sharing your faith also means reading the Bible with your children in a way that causes it to come alive for them. Find age appropriate Bible resources and lessons to incorporate into your family-fun times, as well as your child's education. Make family devotions and Bible reading a priority in your weekly schedule. </p>
<p>
Also, incorporate Christian entertainment, videos, books, games and movies into your child's life. Instead of feeling deprived of fun, let them discover and enjoy quality and inspiring forms of amusement that will also encourage them to develop spiritually.</p> 
<p>
Another great way to share your faith with your children is to allow them the opportunity to make and develop Christian friendships. Their faith will be strengthened if they can share the same values with their friends.<br> Make sure your church offers a children's program and youth group that your children will want to be involved in. </p>
<p><font size="+1">
What children will gain from living in Faith </font> </p>
<p>
Lastly, show your children what's in it for them. This is probably one of the most difficult things for many Christian parents. Often people are brought up to believe that faith is some kind of obligation you fulfil by attending church on Sunday. And let's face it, children today aren't interested in obligations unless there is some kind of pay out at the end. 
Here are some great pay outs:</p> 
<p>
When you give your life to Christ, you secure your place in heaven. <br>What child do you know that doesn't want something they don't have to earn, but rather is given to them as a gift?</p>
<p>
When God enters your life, you receive unconditional love. What a concept for a young person! Someone who will love and accept them as they are with no strings attached.</p>
<p>
Being a Christian means experiencing freedom. As you develop your relationship with Christ, you can be free from worry and anxiety, addictions, and so many other problems that seem to plague young people. When you do things God's way, you receive the benefits of that relationship.</p>
<p>
Having God's favour on your life is like unwrapping a gift every single day.<br> God's favour is an amazing blessing that makes people want to be good to you for no apparent reason. What young person wouldn't want God's blessings in their life? Of course, it wouldn't be fair to tell your children about the pay outs and not tell them about the responsibilities that come with Christian living.<br> Here are some of those:
<p> <font size="+1">
Putting God first </font></p>
<p>
This means making the commitment to seek God. This isn't an easy concept for children. There's a lot of competition for first place in the life of a young person. But parents can help children understand that God wants them to be happy and successful even more than they do. What a great thing for a young person to hear!</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Finding ways to be a blessing </font></p>
<p>
Many children are very self centred. The concept of "being a blessing" means taking the focus off them and onto someone else. This is best learned if they can see you living it. Include them in the process when you can. You'll be amazed at how good your children will feel about themselves.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Acting right on purpose</font></p> 
<p>
This means treating people with kindness, respect, and patience, even those that are hard to love like parents, brothers and sisters.<br> Right behaviour is Christianity in action.</p>
<p>
Sharing your faith doesn't have to be complicated. Start by living it in your own life so your children can see it in action. Demonstrate your commitment and the value you place in an ongoing relationship with God by finding ways to be a blessing. Children learn best by example and modelling your faith is the best example they will ever see. </p>
<h3>
Biblical child training
</h3>
<p>
There is an explosion of information today, much of which is false or unverifiable. Man desperately needs an accurate and reliable source of information that will provide beneficial and verifiable results when used.<br> The Bible provides that source. When an intensive investigation has been honestly performed and a specific subject has been systematically developed from the Bible, the result is dependable information by which man can successfully live his life. In a day when most information is based on man's constantly changing opinions and his limited observations, it is exciting to see the objective truth of God's revelation presented. This truth is information by which man can live his life with the confidence that he is right. <br>It is also truth that will produce predictable results when properly utilised.</p>
<p>
"What the Bible Says About Child Training" by J. Richard Fugate is a study designed to help parents to better understand their role and to reveal the mechanics for successfully raising children. To accomplish these ends this book carefully defines parental accountability, authority, and responsibility.<br> It also describes the nature of a child and explains his Biblically defined stages of development. With these principles firmly established, the book presents the Biblical system for training children.</p>
<p>
This system is divided into two distinct phases, controlling and teaching.<br> The control phase is the establishment of the parents' right of rulership over the will of the child. When parents can control their children, they have laid the necessary foundation for the fulfilment of the Biblical commandment for children to obey their parents. The teaching phase can only be accomplished by parents who have first trained their children to obey. This is because, before a child will receive the instructions of his parents, he must first respect their word; and before he will respect their word, he must first become obedient.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well pleasing to the Lord." Col 3:20</font></p>
<p>
Children will not accept instruction from those whom they do not respect.<br> The Biblical commandment for children to honour their father and mother is fulfilled when children respect their parents enough to accept their advice and instructions of wisdom.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Honour your father and mother," (Eph 6:2)</font></p>
<p>
Parents who utilise this system consistently from the time their children are very young have God's guarantee of success. It is possible for even those parents who have failed in training their child during his early years to gain control and still produce an obedient and respectful child.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"So shall My word be that goes forth out of My mouth; it shall not return to Me void, but it shall accomplish what I please, and it shall prosper in the thing for which I sent it." (Isa 55:11)</font></p>
<p>
This book "What the Bible Says About Child Training" is unique in that the subject is handled solely from the Biblical viewpoint. The author accepts the Bible as absolute truth and as infinitely superior to any human system of thinking. There has been no attempt to modify God's Word to make it compatible with human philosophies, psychology, sociology, religious views, or public opinion. God's Word is accepted as is, without human adulteration.<br> The Bible is also accepted as living and powerful information that is as relevant today as in the day when it was first revealed.</p>
<p>
So you are the father or mother of a child who is dependent on you for support, protection, and most of all guidance. All parents must realise that the physical ability to have children does not automatically qualify them for the task of properly training children. Therefore, what do you do now? <br>This chapter outlines the dilemma most parents face in raising their children.</p>
<p>
Being a parent today is a difficult and often bewildering challenge. There are so many conflicting theories about child training that even the reputed "experts" disagree with each other. Everyone has his own opinion on how children should be raised. Prior to the late 1940's, this confusion didn't exist. <br>Old fashioned child training methods were passed down from generation to generation. But, in 1945 the new psychological approach became popularised by Dr. Benjamin Spock's book, Baby and Child Care. This book sold nearly one million copies the first year, and about thirty million copies to date (second only in sales to the Bible). This means that more than one-third of all parents over the past fifty years have had this book; and many of them have followed its advice religiously.<br> Dr. Spock taught parents not to inhibit (restrain) a child, but to give him freedom to be himself; and not to use physical punishment (chastisement) in disciplining a child, but lovingly reason with him instead. A steady stream of books and magazine articles have carried that message of behavioural psychology forward to the present day.</p>
<p>
To add to the parents' confusion about proper child training has been the religious teaching on love that equates Christian grace and love with tolerance of even wrong doing (permissiveness). We need to examine the issue of Christian love from the Biblical viewpoint to determine its proper use in child training. First, let's see what Biblical love is not:</p>
<p><font size="+1">
The wrong type of love</font></p>
<p>
It is not love to raise a child who lacks self-discipline and is therefore guided by his or her lusts for attention, food or drink, sex, play and entertainment, wandering, loafing, or seeking to gain something for nothing. Which of these lusts have hampered your own life? Do you wish you would have been better trained in self-discipline?</p>
<p>
It is not love to train a child not to be responsible for his own actions and not to accept the consequences of those actions. What has it cost you as an adult to have blamed others or justified yourself for your own mistakes and failures? Would you have progressed further and sooner in your life had you been trained to be more responsible as a child?</p>
<p><font size="+1">
The right type of love</font></p>
<p>
One of the benefits of this book "What the Bible Says About Child Training" will be the clarification of how parents can demonstrate true Christian love to their children by a balanced and responsible exercise of their authority. <br>It will demonstrate that when toleration of wrong behaviour is applied to the raising of children, it results in an overly-permissive approach that produces tragic results. Distinction between the attributes of love and the practice of love needs to be understood, and then kept in mind throughout the study:</p>
<p>
The attributes of Christian love are expressed in 1 Cor 13:4-7 and Phil 2:1-4 as being patient, kind, not easily provoked, merciful, and humble -- all which Christian parents would desire to emulate. However, these attributes in no way nullify the equally important attributes of righteousness and justice.<br> For example, a righteous government can not apply the attributes of patience, kindness, or mercy to law breakers. In the practice of proper government, justice can not be served by a tolerance of criminal activity. Governments must uphold righteous law for a stable condition to exist within a nation.</p>
<p>
Likewise, parents are to provide for and comfort their children; but they are also required to set and enforce righteous standards for them. The practice of Christian love in parenting is exercised when parents combine the righteousness of setting legitimate standards for their children with the justice of fairly punishing for disobedience. It is in a child's best interest to learn right from wrong as well as to develop self-control over his self-centred nature. <br>Loving parents will therefore train a child for his own benefit.<br> This training process will require personal sacrifice on the parents' part, and that is even further demonstration of true Christian love in practice.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." (John 15:13)</font></p>
<p>
When righteousness and justice are practised according to God's principles in the training of children, there will be a balance for our responsive love; and then incorrect and unsuccessful extremes will be avoided. Parents can be firm in setting and enforcing righteous standards without being tyrannical or abusive. They can sacrificially give of themselves on behalf of their children, but still not give in to the demands of an immature child.</p>
<h3>
Warning
</h3>
<p>
Let's face the truth, most parents don't evade training their children properly because they "love" them so much. It's because we parents from previously untrained generations are self-centred, lazy, and lack the character to handle conflict with our children. We will stand by and allow our children to raise themselves, rather than sacrifice our time or our emotions for their benefit -- i.e., to love them. Perhaps committing yourself to truly loving your children before reading this book is your first step to successful child training.</p>
<p>
You can begin to see why knowing how to train children is a challenge today.<br> We have the remnants of old fashioned child training; the new humanistic behavioural psychology methods; and a wishy-washy, lukewarm tolerance of all things. To top these opinions off, we have a multitude of Christian books on child rearing that give forth a wide range of personal advice and opinions.<br> Many of these books lean heavily on the theories of behavioural psychology rather than on the principles set forth in the Bible. Others intermingle elements of psychology with Bible verses and/or the religious concepts of love, thus adding to the general confusion. A few even attack specific Bible verses in an attempt to justify their personal positions!</p>
<p>
It is no surprise that mass confusion about child rearing exists. About the only thing the reputed "experts" do agree upon is: "there is no set pattern for training children." In other words, they say that there is no one, right way to parent. Many of these "experts" have taken the position that parental use of any physical discipline constitutes child abuse. This has caused conscientious parents to question their right to discipline their own children. With advice like this, it is no wonder that the past several generations of parents have turned to their own understanding for their best guess on child training.</p>
<p>
These parents develop a system of child training consisting of a mixture of the confused information available. It probably contains some behaviour modification, some non-Biblical love, and the use of force when all else fails. This system will produce great instability for both children and parents as the parents over-compensate from one extreme to the other. As a result the parents exist between ineffectiveness and guilt; while their children exist between frustration and anger.</p>
<p>
Without any clear system, parents will default to the trial and error method -- the hope that the second child will benefit from the mistakes made with the first, that the third will benefit from the mistakes made with the second, and so forth. Some parents believe they can be successful by simply avoiding the mistakes they think their own parents made. The question for all parents who are raising their children on their own opinions is this: how do you know when your system is correct?</p>
<p>
As a parent, you have only one chance with each child. You spend a major part of your life raising a child, and all that effort can seem painfully wasted unless there are positive results. Are you satisfied that you know how to handle that one chance to the benefit of each child? Have you considered the cost to your children and to yourself if you fail to train them properly? <br>These are awesome questions that every parent must face.</p>
<p>
What is the answer? Is there a system for child training that can end all of this confusion? Is there one that you can know for sure is correct and that can be utilised to obtain the right results? Yes! This book "What the Bible Says About Child Training" sets forth the only system for child training given in the Bible -- <br>a system you can use with confidence in becoming a successful parent.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Now this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing according to His will, He hears us; And if we know that He hear us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him." <br>(1 John 5:14-15)</font></p>
<p>
God promises blessings for parents who properly train their children: <br> <font color= "blue">A wise son makes a glad father (Prov 10:1; 23:24-25; 29:17; 31:28).</font></p>
<p>
God also warns of cursing for parents who don't: <br><font color= "blue">But a foolish son is the grief of his mother (Prov 10:1b; 17:21: 29:15b).</font> </p>
<p>
Over the years, I have spoken to thousands of concerned parents and a particular question often arises: "Is it really a promise from God that our children will turn out okay if we properly train them?" Some Christian authors have denied this concept.<br> Please note that it is not just:<br> 
<font color= "blue">"Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it." (Prov 22:6)</font> that indicates a guarantee.<br> All of the other passages cited in this lesson warn us that young adults are the products of their upbringing. It seems very clear to me that parents who raise their child to be a fool (one who rejects God's Word in living his life) will reap the promise of cursing. Equally clear is the promise that training up a wise child, who honours his parents as well as God's Word, will result in blessings for both parents and child.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Honour your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land which the Lord your God is giving you." (Ex 20:12)</font></p>

<p><font color= "blue">"Honour your father and mother" which is the first commandment with promise, "that it may be well with you, and you may live long on the earth." (Eph 6:2-3)</font></p>
<p>
I have never known of a child "going bad" who was raised by a Christian father and mother who both practised: a right marriage (father in leadership, mother in support, both operating in love and justice), and; correct child training principles (with a proper balance between controlling and teaching). <br>On the other hand, I have met a great number of young adults who have paid a terrible price because their Christian parents failed in properly training them. Some of these young adults have been delivered by God's grace from not being trained and now understand the source of their problems. Each and every one of these restored ones are now committed not to repeat their parents' mistakes.</p>
<p>
My prayer is that parents who read the book "What the Bible Says About Child Training" will commit themselves to training their children in the way they should go.</p>
