<h1>
Prayer and Fellowship with God
</h1>
<p>
Why don’t we see the will of God on earth? Does God want you to be healed? Yes. Does God want you to prosper, in every sense? Yes. Does God have good things for you? Yes! Does God have solutions to the problems you face? Yes. Then why don’t we see more of the will of God on earth? The answer varies – but one thing is sure: we can “download” heaven to earth through prayer. God put eternity in the heart of man, and the kingdom of God is within you. How do we make the kingdom of God manifest? The answer is prayer. Prayer is a key to the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>
God is a relational being; He desires your companionship. Only He can give you the wisdom and discernment necessary to walk in the fullness of His plan. There are “defining moments” in your life that push you into His plan. You won’t see these moments unless you are in prayer and have the discernment to recognise them. You need to be in prayer so you don’t miss your moment!</p>
<p>
God can change your situation in a second, but if we don’t recognise or discern the moment, we may miss it – and have to go around the mountain again! Don’t keep going around the same mountain…you have dwelled there long enough! Don’t settle for less than your “covenant privileges.” Get into your prayer closet and spend some time with God!</p>
<p>
The kingdom of God is on the inside of you, because of Jesus Christ dwelling in your heart by faith and because of His Spirit living on the inside of you. Only by being a person of prayer and having fellowship with God do we activate the treasure God has placed within each of us. His presence activates the eternity He placed inside of you! That’s why you must have fellowship with the Father through prayer to know what you need to do next. When you step into your prayer closet and fellowship with Father God, you tap into His supernatural power and wisdom. You will be able to see your God-moment if you have God’s wisdom!</p>

One of the best definitions of “fellowship” is “the state of sharing mutual interests, experiences, and activities.” Even though this is a secular definition from the World English Dictionary, it gives us a clear picture of what we are doing while in prayer with Father God – we are sharing mutual interests, experiences and activities. Let me digress for a moment: God is interested in everything that is affecting you in any way! He long for us to come to Him with every request big, or small. When we are in our prayer closet, He is adjusting our desires and attitudes by His Spirit, making us stronger and more fruitful in the kingdom.</p>

“I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give you. Until now you have asked nothing in My name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.” (John 16:23-24)</font>.</p>
<p>
While in prayer, we make specific requests of God that only He can make happen. As long as we are not asking amiss, you can rest assured that He will give you the things you’ve asked for: <font color= "blue">“And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.” (John 14:13)</font>

Spending time with God gives you an overflow of supernatural provision. Jesus said, <font color= "blue">“Come to Me, all you who labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” (Matt 11:28)</font> When we fellowship with God, we share our interests with Him and release the burdens of our needs. His supernatural presence activates the kingdom of God within you.</p>
<p>
Accepting Jesus Christ is the only way to communicate with God the Father. If we can meditate on His nature, we will be drawn to Him to pray. God is not like people - we don’t have to shrink back from Him. You can crawl up in His lap, and He will wrap His arms of love around you. He will never violate you. He will never hurt you. He will never leave you or forsake you. He doesn’t have a back door or a trap door or a booby trap. God is safe. God is secure. God is a rock, a refuge and a friend. God is our Saviour.</p>
<p>
There are many blessings released by prayer and fellowship with God. Prayer is a necessity for a successful Christian walk. We don’t want to just “exist” on the earth, living beneath our covenant privileges. We are supernatural people of prayer who fellowship with Almighty God only because of the access to the throne of grace bought for us by the Son of God, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>
Don’t miss your defining moment! God has a “suddenly” for you, a God moment, in which the promises He has for you are inherited. The only way to be “in sync” with God is by sharing time with Him in fellowship, and by being in His presence. This month, we individually and corporately determined to be supernatural people of prayer! I challenge you to be determined to get into your prayer closet every day and spend time with God. God is moving this season ... Don’t miss your moment!</p>
