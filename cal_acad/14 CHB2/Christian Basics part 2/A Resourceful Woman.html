   <h1>
A Resourceful Woman
</h1>
<h3>
Who can find a virtuous woman?
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Who can find a virtuous wife? For her worth is far above rubies. (Prov 31:10)</font></p>
<p>
The first part of Prov 31:10 literally reads, "Who can find a woman of strength?"   The term "virtuous" is from a noun meaning strength, efficiency, ability.<br> Here it refers to strength of character, that is, moral strength and firmness.</p> 
<p>
In Ex 18:21 we find the expression used of men.  Moses was to find "able men" (lit.--"men of strength") such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness.  <br>In light of this verse we can say that a virtuous man is one who fears God, loves truth and hates sin. Thus a virtuous man is a man of great moral strength, in whom wickedness is not found.  He is a godly, God-fearing man.  <br>So also, the virtuous woman is a God-fearing woman--compare Prov 31:10 with Prov 31:30.</p>
<p>
When a woman has strength of character (fears God, loves truth, hates sin), then others will take note and recognise this.  It will be very obvious because it is so unusual.  People are usually so morally weak and so anaemic in character, that when a man or woman of strength shows up it is quite evident to all.  <br> The term is also used in Prov 12:4 where we learn that a virtuous woman <br>(lit--a woman of strength) does not make her husband ashamed.</p>
<h3>
What she is worth
</h3>
<p>
She is far more valuable and worth far more than rubies.  The Hebrew term for "rubies" may not refer to rubies, but may refer to pink pearls or red coral. <br>It is difficult to know exactly which stone or pearl this Hebrew word referred to, but its usage in the Old Testament tells us two things for sure: <br> 
1)  It was very valuable (see Prov 20:15 and Job 28:18);<br>
2)  It was reddish in colour (Lam 4:7--"ruddy").</p>
<p>
Who can find a virtuous woman (a woman of strength)?  She is like a rare gem.  Precious stones are precious and costly because they are so rare. <br>The virtuous woman is a beautiful woman, not necessarily outwardly, but certainly inwardly (see Prov. 31:30).  She is not only a rare gem but a beautiful gem.</p>
<p>
A godly woman is rare and very hard to find.  The same thing could be said about the godly man.<br>  
If a young man is looking for a godly woman, how can he find her? <br> First he should trust God to find her for him. <br> Second, he must realise that a virtuous woman is not going to want just any man.  She is going to want to find a virtuous man (a man of strength, a man valiant for the truth, a godly servant of Christ).<br>
So in this opening verse we have learned that the godly woman is very hard to find.  She is more valuable than a rare gem.  She has an inner beauty and a strength of character and a moral firmness that is lacking in the vast majority of women, even believing women.</p>
<h3>
She rises early
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
She also rises while it is yet night, and provides food for her household, and a portion for her maidservants. (Prov 31:15)</font></p> 
<p>
She is up before the sun, showing that idleness and laziness have no place with her (compare Prov 31:27).  The sluggard (Prov 6:6-11) should not only go to the ant, but should also go to the virtuous woman to learn a lesson on diligence.  There are great benefits to rising up early.  It is a quiet time free from the noise and distractions of the day.  It is an ideal time to spend with the Lord in quiet meditation and prayer, starting the day with Him. </p>
<p>
We also see this principle in the manna which God provided for the children of Israel in the wilderness.  Manna had to be gathered anew every morning<br> (Ex 16:14-22), just as fresh food for our souls is needed each day.</p>
<p>
We have the example of our blessed Lord: <font color= "blue">"Now in the morning, having risen a long while before daylight, He went out and departed to a solitary place; and there He prayed.(Mark 1:35)</font>. </p>
<p>
The Psalmist was in the habit of morning prayer: <font color= "blue">"In the morning my prayer comes before You." (Psa 88:13)</font>. </p>
<p>
May God help us to start our days well, beginning the day with God and getting a good early start on the tasks and duties that demand our attention and diligence. Needless to say, a mother may have to sleep in after being up during the night with a sick child.  the virtuous woman is diligent, yet flexible and realistic.</p>
<h3>
She provides food for her household
</h3>
<p>
One of the reasons she rises up so early is to provide food for her household.  When the father and children get up they are greeted with a hearty, home-cooked breakfast!   Nutritionists consider breakfast the most important meal of the day, nourishing the body that has not had any food for many hours (the "breaking of the fast," that is, "breakfast") and providing energy for the toil of the day.  The virtuous woman makes sure that her family gets off to a good nutritional start.  This term "food" (translated by some as "game") is also used in Psa 111:5 of God's gracious provision of food for those who fear Him.</p>
<p>
Young women today, in many cases, hardly know how to prepare meals.<br> Many families eat out frequently or order food that can be brought into the home.  How many families take time to sit down at a meal together around the table?  Often families don't eat together, don't pray together, don't read together, and as a result don't stay together.</p>
<p>
Her maidens are her female servants.  This virtuous woman was blessed with a large household that included female maids or servants.  She did not live in poverty.  We are reminded that under the Old Testament economy, the Israelites who honoured and feared the Lord were promised not only spiritual blessings but also material blessings, and certainly the woman described in Prov 31 had both.</p>
<h3>
She purchases property
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
She considers a field and buys it; from her profits she plants a vineyard.<br> (Prov 31:16)</font></p>
<p>
The godly woman considers buying a field (a plot of land in open country).<br>  She doesn't do this rashly or on a sudden impulse, but she has given very careful thought to the matter. She has a plan for her family and she carefully thinks about what she needs.  She decides that a prosperous vineyard would be beneficial to all, and thus she decides upon a field that would be suitable.</p>
<p>
From what we know about this godly woman, she did not act independently of her husband. <br> We know that <font color= "blue">The heart of her husband safely trusts her; so he will have no lack of gain (Prov 31:11)</font>, which would not be the case if his wife were running around purchasing all kinds of things without his knowledge! <br> The godly wife, under the headship of her husband, can play a significant role in managing family finances.  Some wives are very good at keeping a cheque book and managing the family budget, and it would be to the advantage of the family for the husband to delegate this responsibility to her.</p>
<p>
How many women buy all kinds of things on the spur of the moment without giving the matter careful thought and deliberation?  As she races out to the shopping mall with her friends, can her husband safely trust in her?<br>  [We also might ask, can the wife trust her husband when he goes shopping?]</p>
<h3> 
She plants a vineyard.
</h3>
<p>
The purpose of the field was to provide a place for a vineyard so that the family and others could enjoy the fruit of the vine.  The fruit of her hands signifies the result of her labour.  To cultivate a field and to  maintain a vineyard requires much labour.  The vineyard was the fruit of her loving toil.
Perhaps she employed her female servants (Prov 31:15) to work the field or to help her work the field.</p>
<h3>
Working Diligently
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
She perceives that her merchandise is good, and her lamp does not go out by night. (Prov 31:18)</font></p>
<p>
The godly woman purchased a field, planted a vineyard, and gave herself to this ambitious endeavour with great strength (Prov 31:16-17).  In Prov 31:18 she is experiencing the rewards of her labour. She finds how profitable her industry is as she experiences the sale of its product.  She sees that her trading is profitable.  She is reaping what she sowed by her diligent industry, and she is finding it to be a good harvest. She is seeing the results of the labours of her hands.  She learns that success results from her labours and she reaps the fruits of hard work.</p>
<p>
Her merchandise is known to be good, and brings a ready market and a good price; and her knowledge of this is a sufficient reward of itself for her toils; for when the lazy are perpetually uneasy by their reflections on their own conduct, the consciousness of having done her duty, and the prospect of the advantages arising from it, are a constant source of satisfaction and cheerfulness to the virtuous woman.</p>
<h3>
Her candle (lamp) does not go out by night.
</h3>
<p>
Homes in Bible times were illuminated at night by olive oil lamps. <br> The virtuous woman's lamp did not go out at night, that is, it was not quenched or extinguished (see 1 Sam 3:3).  What was she doing at night?  Probably the activity mentioned in Prov 31:19 (hand spinning). Here was a woman who worked day and night with amazing diligence and fortitude.  We might say she "burned the midnight oil."  If you were to pass by her house late at night you would see that her light would still be on.  We wonder when this woman ever slept because in these verse she is working late at night and in Prov 31:15 she rises while it is yet night.  The fact that she rises indicates that she did get some sleep.  We have the expression, "early to bed, early to rise," but she seems to have been in the habit of "late to bed, early to rise."</p> 
<p>
The godly woman is diligent both day and night, and is able to get the necessary sleep, without overindulging in sleep.  The poverty mentioned in Prov 6:9-11 will not be her portion.</p>
<h3>
Making and Selling
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
She makes tapestry for herself; her clothing is fine linen and purple.     She makes linen garments and sells them, and supplies sashes for the merchants.<br>
(Prov 31:22,24)</font></p>
<p>
The virtuous woman took time to decorate and adorn her bedroom with beautiful bedspreads and coverings.                   
Her clothing is attractive and beautiful, of the finest material.
The purple was manufactured by the Phoenicians from a shellfish.</p> 
<p>
What is the meaning of this verse?   The virtuous woman did not dress in a shabby manner.  She was industrious and enterprising, and she was able to purchase the finest materials, and with her own hands make the finest of garments.  She did not consider it a mark of spirituality to go around looking impoverished, dilapidated, and threadbare.  Rather, as was often true under the former dispensation, material prosperity was a sign of God's blessing, and was not to be despised. </p>
<p>
It is important to remember that the wearing of costly garments did not come at the expense of her family or the poor, nor did it interfere with any of her God-given duties:</p>
<p>
If the virtuous woman has coverings of tapestry for her house, she makes them herself; if she is clothed with fine linen, and purple, she earns it by her labours and good management. She does not starve her charity by her finery, nor spend upon her dress that which might support a poor family, and she does not reckon herself superior to the duties of a wife, nor exempted by wearing silk and purple from using her spindle and distaff.  From all this it appears that the inspired writer allows the use of costly array to none but those who can afford it in a full consistency with the duties which they owe to their families, to the poor, and to all men</p>
