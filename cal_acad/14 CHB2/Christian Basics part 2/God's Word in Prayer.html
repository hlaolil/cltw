   <h1>
God's Word in Prayer
</h1>
<p>
The number one rule in praying for results is to base your prayer on God's Word. It can be relied on just as you would depend on the word of your best friend. <br>If you trust him, you will believe what he says. Faith in God operates the same way. God's Word is the integrity of God Himself (John 17:17). </p>
<p>
As an example, let's use the prayer for salvation. Your first step is to go to the Word and find out what God says you must do to be saved.<br> <font color= "blue"> "that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation." (Rom 10:9-10)</font></p>
<p>
This scripture is the basis for your prayer. You confess with your mouth Jesus is Lord and you believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead. God's Word says it so you can accept it as fact. When you fulfil these two prerequisites, the Word says, "You will be saved." You must receive it by faith.</p> 
<h3>
The Prayer of Salvation
</h3>
<p>
When you pray the prayer of salvation, you may not feel differently. Realise that your feelings do not have anything to do with it. God's Word is His part of your prayer life. He has already said in His Word, "You will be saved."<br> You have allowed the Word of God to engineer your prayer. It makes no difference how you feel. Exercise your faith. By the authority of God's Word you are saved! 
Jesus said, <font color= "blue">"Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them." (Mark 11:24)</font></p>
<p>
God's Word is His will. When you pray in line with the Word, you have automatically prayed in line with God's will. <font color= "blue">"Now this is the confidence that we have in Him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. And if we know that He hears us, whatever we ask, we know that we have the petitions that we have asked of Him." (1 John 5:14-15)</font>
Your prayer for salvation, based on God's Word, was clearly heard by the Father. After you pray and receive your salvation by faith, you then simply thank God for it. </p>
<h3>
The Prayer of Healing
</h3>
<p>
Praying for healing involves the same faith principles. Search God's Word for your answer. </p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities; the chastisement for our peace was upon Him, and by His stripes we are healed." (Isa 53:5)</p></font>
<p><font color= "blue">
"He Himself took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses." (Matt 8:17)</font></p>
<p>
Undoubtedly healing is God's will. According to these scriptures, Jesus paid the full price - not only for sin, but for sickness, disease and the consequences of sin. More religious traditions have discounted God's will for healing than those that discredit salvation. To know God's will toward healing, look at Jesus.<br> Jesus said, <font color= "blue">"He who has seen Me has seen the Father; " (John 14:9).</font></p> 
<p>
During His time on earth, Jesus was the express image of God (Heb 1:3).<br> What did He do? He healed the sick. <font color= "blue">"God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed by the devil; for God was with Him." (Acts 10:38)</font></p>
<p>
The prayer for healing is a simple one. You say, "Father, in the Name of Jesus, I see in Your Word that healing belongs to me. I believe I receive it. I thank You for it. I act upon it now." <br>
Once you have prayed, trust. Do not let Satan convince you that you are still sick. He will try his best to sell you his lies. Stand your ground! Say, "Satan, it is written ..." Then begin to speak what God's Word says about your healing.</p> 
<p>
Just as he fled at the command of Jesus' words, Satan will have to flee when you speak God's Word in faith (Matt 4:1-11). He has no defence against the Word of God when it is spoken in faith by a believer.</p>
