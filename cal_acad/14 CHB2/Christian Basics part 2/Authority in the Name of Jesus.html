   <h1>
Authority in the Name of Jesus
</h1>
<h3>
The Power of a Name
</h3>
<p>
What is the power of someone's name? It is a word or expression in which someone is represented to us. When I mention or hear a name, it brings to mind the whole man, what I know of him, and also the impression he has made on me. The name of a king includes his honour, his power, and his kingdom.<br> His name is the symbol of his power. And so each name of God embodies and represents some part of the glory of the Unseen One. The Name of Christ is the expression of everything He has done and everything He is and lives to do as our Mediator.</p>
<p>
What does it mean to do a thing in the name of another? It is to come with his power and authority, as his representative and substitute. Using another's name always presupposes a common interest. No one would give another the free use of his name without first being assured his honour and interests were as safe with another as with himself.</p>
<p>
What does it mean when Jesus gives us power over His Name--the free use of it--with assurance that whatever we ask in His Name will be given to us? <br>(John 14:13-14; 15:16; 16:23-24, 26). <br>Jesus solemnly gives to all His a general and unlimited power to use His Name at all times for everything they desire. He could not do this if He did not know that He could trust us with His interests and that His honour would be safe in our hands.</p>
<p>
The free use of someone else's name is always a token of great confidence and close union. Someone who gives his name to another stands aside to let that person act for him. Someone who takes the name of another gives up his own as of no value. When I go in the name of another, I deny myself. I take not only the name of another, but himself and what he is, instead of myself and what I am.</p>
<p>
When the Lord Jesus went to heaven, He left His work--the management of His Kingdom on earth--in the hands of His servants. He also gave them His Name to draw all the supplies they needed for the due conduct of His affairs.<br> Christ's servants have the spiritual power to use the Name of Jesus only insofar as they yield themselves to live only for the interests and the work of the Master. The use of the Name always supposes the surrender of our interests to Him Whom we represent.</p>
<p>
Oneness of life on earth gives oneness of name. We are one with Jesus; we have one life and one Spirit with Him. For this reason we may proceed in His Name. Our power in using that Name, whether with God, men, or devils, depends on the measure of our spiritual life-union with Christ. Our use of His Name rests on the unity of our lives with Him.</p>
<p>
No one really gives himself up to live in the Name of Jesus without receiving in ever-increasing measure the spiritual capacity to ask for and receive in that Name whatever he desires. My bearing of the name of another shows that I have given up my own name and, with it, my own independent life.<br> But just as surely, it shows I have possession of everything belonging to the name I have taken instead of my own.</p>
<p>
We are not acting in the name of someone who is absent. Jesus Himself is with the Father. When we pray to the Father, it must be in Jesus' Name. <br>The Name represents the person. The Name and the Spirit of Jesus are one. <br>To ask in His Name is to ask in full union of interest, life, and love with Himself, as one who lives in and for Him.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do," (John 14:13)</font>,  means "in my nature." With God, things are requested according to their nature.<br> Asking in Christ's Name doesn't mean that at the end of some request we say, "This I ask in the Name of Jesus Christ." It means we are praying according to His nature, which is love that doesn't seek its own will, but only the will of God and the good of all creatures. Such asking is the cry of Christ's own Spirit in our hearts.</p>
<p>
As we bear the Name before men, we have the power to use it before God.<br> Let us plead for God's Holy Spirit to show us what the Name means, and what the right use of it is. It is through the Spirit that the Name, which is above every name in heaven, will take the place of supremacy in our hearts and lives. <br>The treasures and powers of the spiritual world are placed at your disposal to help those around you.</p>
<h3>
Must we address Jesus by his Name?
</h3>
<p>
The name "Jesus" is the name associated with "the shame" which he endured in order that <font color= "blue">"He will save His people from their sins." (Matt 1:21)</font>.<br>
Therefore, His people (those who had a personal relationship with Him) never addressed Him as "Jesus," but as "master" or "lord", and so should all His people today. (John 13:13-14, Luke 6:46)</p>
<p>
The only ones who irreverently called him "Jesus" were demons, his enemies, and those who did not have a personal relationship with him. We should not follow the examples of them, but we should follow the examples of those who had a close, personal relationship with him. Those who had a personal relationship with Jesus never addressed Jesus, face to face, as "Jesus."</p>
<p>
The following passages are all the verses in scripture in which Jesus was personally addressed as "Jesus," face to face. Notice who was addressing Him, face to face, in each case.</p>
<p>
A man possessed with devils (Matt 8:29)</p>
<p>
A man with an unclean spirit in the synagogue (Mark 1:23, Luke 4:34)</p>
<p>
A man with an unclean spirit in the country of the Gadarenes,<br> (Mark 5:7, Luke 8:28)</p>
<p>
Jews in a crowd (Matt 21:11)</p>
<p>
Unbelieving Jews (John 6:42)</p>
<p>
The accusers of Peter, who were enemies of Christ (Matt 26:69,71, Mark 14:67)</p>
<p>
Pilate, the one who delivered Jesus to be crucified <br>(Matt 27:17,22,37, John 18:33, John 19:19)</p>
<p>
Chief priests and elders, who persuaded the multitude to destroy Jesus <br>(Matt 27:20).</p>
<p>
Did anyone else call him Jesus? Yes. Some of the people Jesus healed called him "Jesus," but they had no personal relationship with Him at that time.</p>
<p>
Lepers called Him "Jesus" (Luke 17:13).</p>
<p>
A man who was sick for 38 years told others that "Jesus" healed him <br>(John 5:15).</p>
<p>
Bartimaeus, who was blind, called him "Jesus" (Mark 10:47, Luke 18:37-38). But notice the reason why he called Him "Jesus." It was because when he asked what the commotion in the crowd was all about, a Jew told Bartimaeus that "Jesus" was passing by.</p>
<p>
Notice the following three parallel passages. Jesus asked His disciples who they thought He was. Peter did not say, "You are Jesus." Instead, Peter called him according to the relationship between the two of them.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, "Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?" So they said, "Some say John the Baptist, some Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets." He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" Simon Peter answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." (Matt 16:13-16)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Now Jesus and His disciples went out to the towns of Caesarea Philippi; and on the road He asked His disciples, saying to them, "Who do men say that I am?"  So they answered, "John the Baptist; but some say, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets." He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" Peter answered and said to Him, "You are the Christ." (Mark 8:27-29)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"And it happened, as He was alone praying, that His disciples joined Him, and He asked them, saying, "Who do the crowds say that I am?" So they answered and said, "John the Baptist, but some say Elijah; and others say that one of the old prophets has risen again." He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" Peter answered and said, "The Christ of God." (Luke 9:18-20)</font></p>
<p>
Therefore, when someone asks you, "Who are you?" do not tell them your name, but tell them who you are according to the Word and Spirit of God. You are a bondsman of Christ.</p>
