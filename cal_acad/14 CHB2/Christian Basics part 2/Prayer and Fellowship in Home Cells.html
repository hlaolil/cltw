Prayer and Fellowship in Home Cells
</h1>
<p>
The cell-based model of ministry is one that some visionaries of church growth believe to be an important model for the future. It is a strategy of ministry that church congregations of all denominations are either using, adopting or are considering adopting.</p>
<p>
The cell-based approach is a shift in the purpose and function of a congregation. The cell church is based on members meeting in holistic small groups and then coming together weekly to praise and worship as a congregation.</p>
<p>
The small group or cell group component enables the presence of Christ to be manifested in relationships of caring Christians. In this environment people are edified and equipped to minister. Unbelievers are saved and discipled. Leadership is raised up and mentored. The weekly corporate worship becomes a time of praise and celebration centred on the glory of God.</p>
<p>
Under the unity of the larger congregation, the cell groups are mobilised to carry out the ministry vision of the congregation and the denomination. <br>The cell groups nurture a sense of belonging that is difficult to experience in the large weekly worship assembly. In the cell groups, love, community, relationships, discipling and reaching out to unbelievers spring up naturally and powerfully.</p>
<p>
The spiritual gifts of members are confirmed and used, worship is expanded, prayer is prominent for the needs of the group and the congregation as a whole, and ministry is extended by cell church strategy. It is in the cell group that caring for one another occurs.</p>
<p>
It is this loving, bonded community of believers, which is the manifested body of Christ, that reaches out to unbelievers and brings Christ to the world <br>(John 13:35).<br> Members and new believers are taught to know, to grow in, to serve and to share Jesus. A cell-based church actively seeks to develop each Christian into the likeness of Christ.</p>
<p>
In the human body the basic unit of life is the cell. In a cell church, the basic unit of the body of Christ is the cell group. This basic unit is the means by which Christian community is built and the work of the kingdom is performed.</p>
