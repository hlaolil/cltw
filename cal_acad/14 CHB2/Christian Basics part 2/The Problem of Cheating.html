The Problem of Cheating
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
A wicked man accepts a bribe behind the back to pervert the ways of justice. (Prov 17:23)</font></p>
<h3>
Gifts = Bribes
</h3>
<p>
Rulers, judges, and witnesses must have great character. They will face many attempts to buy their favour in order to pervert justice. Righteous men are never moved by such offers. But wicked men will take secret gifts from others, and they will overthrow justice and judgement to earn their abominable wages of unrighteousness.</p>
<p>
Gifts here are bribes, a payment to corrupt a person and induce him to act in the interest of the giver by altering the law or perverting judgement. <br>By their nature, bribes are very secretive, for their discovery leads to severe punishment for both giver and receiver. So they were hidden in the bosom, under the clothing, for a very private transfer.<br> <font color= "blue">A gift in secret pacifies anger, and a bribe behind the back, strong wrath.<br>(Prov 21:14)</font>.</p>
<p>
The wicked man taking the gift is the receiver of the bribe. He takes the gift produced from the payer’s bosom. He is the ruler, judge, or witness that is willing to pervert the ways of judgement for reward. In bribery, the great offence is by the receiver, for the one in authority is held to a much higher standard of integrity than the one under authority.</p>
<p>
Fear of fines, imprisonment, or even capital punishment is a strong motive for men to offer money to be delivered. A little money to get out of punishment appears to be a simple solution. But the chief wickedness condemned here, and throughout the Bible, is the evil character of the man who would consider taking such a payment to do wrong.</p>
<p>
Taking gifts is an easy way to enhance your living. Men slip you nice amounts of money, motivated by fear or greed, because of your position of influence. <br>You have to do nothing but look the other way or slightly alter your judgement to provide the giver his desire.</p>
<p>
Done regularly, such transactions make men rich, with hardly any effort.<br> After all, it is called a gift, because it did not come by labour. And such easy income attracts and affects men (Prov 17:8; 18:16; 19:6). <br>To a wicked and depraved man, this is very easy money.</p>
<p>
God condemned bribes. He wrote, <font color= "blue">“And you shall take no bribe, for a bribe blinds the discerning and perverts the words of the righteous.” (Ex 23:8)</font>.<br> And again, <font color= "blue">“You shall not pervert justice; you shall not show partiality, nor take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and twists the words of the righteous.” (Deut 16:19)</font>. <br>And the law included the almost inexplicable case of taking money to execute men. <font color= "blue">"Cursed is the one who takes a bribe to slay an innocent person". <br>(Deut 27:25)</font>.</p>
<p>
The essential character of rulers and judges must include a hatred of covetousness.<br> Jethro told Moses, <font color= "blue">“Moreover you shall select from all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them to be rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens.” <br>(Ex 18:21)</font>. <br>It would be wonderful if all elected officials and their staffs had to meet this standard.</p>
<p>
Even New Testament elders must not have any inclination toward money, for they will be tempted to modify their preaching or judgement to maintain or increase their income (1 Tim 3:3,8; Titus 1:7). Ministers without experience or success in business will be especially tempted to compromise doctrine or judgement to preserve the favour of the major contributors and their own livelihood. Many pastors have modified their message to maintain or increase a church’s attendance in order to enhance their position and income.</p>
<p>
Samuel was a man of great character and faith. He had anointed David king of Israel. This noble man served the nation all his life. <br>But here is what the sacred historian wrote of Samuel’s sons, <font color= "blue">“But his sons did not walk in his ways; they turned aside after dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice.” (1 Sam 8:3)</font>.<br> The language is a perfect corollary to the proverb. So when he was near death, Samuel asked the nation to swear to him that he had never taken a single bribe in the discharge of his office (1 Sam 12:3-5). </p>
<p>
It is a wicked nation that has corrupt officials taking bribes.<br> God condemned Israel for it on more than one occasion (Isa 1:23; Ezek 22:12). The prophet Micah described a level of corruption that included a general conspiracy for rampant bribery (Micah 7:2-4). But the prophet ended his description with a warning of God’s judgement that was coming.</p>
<p>
The temptation for rulers is great. In an immoral or amoral society, the gifts are offered often. Corruption exists at every level. There are some righteous men in high places, and for them you must pray. They face temptations you do not encounter, and you should beseech the Lord to protect them and give them conviction and strength to do justice.</p>
<p>
The story of Balaam is a miserable tale of a covetous prophet being offered money to curse Israel. Peter called the prophet mad, labelled his choice as iniquity, and called his bribe the wages of unrighteousness (2 Pet 2:15-16). Judas Iscariot followed his sordid example by agreeing to betray the Lord Jesus Christ for the mere payment of thirty pieces of silver, the price of a slave <br>(Matt 26:14-16).</p>
<p>
The day is coming in which the omniscient God will make known every secret bribe, for what they hide from men has never been hidden from Him <br>(Eccl 12:14; Rom 2:16). They hide their bribes, for they fear the criticism of men more than the terror of the holy God, but the punishment that is coming will far exceed anything man could have done to them.</p>
<p>
God will bless the man greatly <font color= "blue">“Who gestures with his hands, refusing bribes,” (Isa 33:15-16)</font>.<br> The man <font color= "blue">"Who may dwell in Your holy hill? ... does he take a bribe against the innocent. He who does these things shall never be moved! (Psa 15:1-5).</font><br> Hear the call God gave to Abraham, <font color= "blue">“I am Almighty God; walk before Me and be blameless.” (Gen 17:1)</font>.</p>
<p>
So righteous was Paul, he would not put up the money Felix required to release him from prison, which would have broken both divine and Roman law <br>(Acts 24:25-27). Given Paul’s many friends, the money could easily have been obtained. But though the object would have been renewed preaching of the gospel, the apostle would not do evil that good might come, and he abstained from all appearance of evil (Rom 3:8: 1 Thess 5:22).</p>
<p>
But the most righteous example of all is the Lord Jesus Christ! The love psalm, which Paul quotes in glorifying the Son of God, says this of Jesus the great King: <font color= "blue">“Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of Your kingdom. You love righteousness and hate wickedness; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness more than Your companions.” (Psa 45:6-7; Heb 1:8-9)</font>.</p>
