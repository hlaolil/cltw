<h1>
She Loved Much
</h1>
<p>
Then one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And He went to the Pharisee’s house, and sat down to eat. (Luke 7:36)

Jesus is invited for dinner by one of the Pharisees -- where we are not told, though presumably it is in Galilee where other events in this section took place. Invitation to dinner certainly implied respect for this new teacher and healer. Was He also a prophet? Simon wanted to learn more about Jesus, but it soon becomes obvious that you can't count Simon as a believer -- rather as a sceptic trying to be open-minded.</p>
<p>
It was an honour to host the visiting teacher and His party, and Simon wanted to the honour of hosting this famous rabbi. We can assume that Simon is well-to-do -- most of the Pharisees seemed to be, and this scale of dinner party required a larger home and money for food than the average person had at his disposal.</p>
<p>
Hospitality is a very strong value in the Near East, with much fuss made over guests. For example, a basin would typically be provided so guests could wash the dust of the road from their feet. Scented olive oil was sometimes offered to anoint a guest's hair (Psa 23:5b; 45:7; 92:10; Amos 6:6). And beloved guests would be kissed as they were greeted (2 Sam 15:5; 19:39; Matt 26:49). We see that Simon offered none of these marks of a gracious host. Such overflowing hospitality wasn't required; Simon wasn't being discourteous. The way he welcomed his guests this day seems pro forma (considered a formality), but not especially warm or cordial.</p>
<p>
No matter the warmth, Jesus accepts the dinner invitation. In Luke 7:34 he is criticised for dining with sinners. But he is no respecter of persons. He is willing to associate with the religious elite, as well.</p>
<p>
The text indicates that Jesus sat down to eat. Being a characteristically Eastern style of dining, the guests would be arranged around a very low table, reclining on their left arm and supported by divans or cushions, leaving their right hand free to feed themselves. Their feet, sandals removed, would be splayed out behind them, with some space between their feet and the walls so those who were serving the meal could bring the various dishes to the table. This is also the likely arrangement at the Lord's Supper when Jesus washed the feet of the disciples reclining around the table (John 13:5).</p>
<h3>
The Sinful Woman 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"And behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at the table in the Pharisee’s house, ..." (Luke 7:37)</font></p>
This tells us several things about the woman. Surely, she has not been invited. While she is a resident of the town, she is looked down upon as a sinner. We're not told what her sin is, but she is probably a prostitute rather than an adulteress. However, in Jesus' day it was very rare for adulterers to actually be stoned as the law directed (see Lev 20:10; Deut 22:22; and John 8:1-11). The Romans did not allow the Jews to inflict the death penalty; the most they could administer was forty lashes less one. More often, sinners were shunned by respectable society and prohibited from participation in the local synagogue.</p>
<p>
We don't know how she came to be a prostitute if at all.  Or perhaps she was a widow struggling to survive. We just can't say, and should know better than to judge her harshly.</p>
<p>
There's something else we can deduce about this woman -- that she has been battered down. Her self-image is tattered and ragged. Her spirit is wounded. Perhaps you've felt like that; perhaps you feel like that right now. You've failed miserably, and though time has passed, you still are humiliated and unsure, and feel too weak and fragile to pick yourself up and move on.</p>
<p>
For her to come to the banquet at Simon the Pharisee's house is hard, too. She is viewed as a sinner, one who conveys uncleanness by her very touch, almost as if she has a communicable disease. She knows that Simon will not be happy to see her in his house.</p>
<p>
But the woman has heard of Jesus. She has probably heard His teaching. She has heard His gracious words of God's love and forgiveness and healing and restoration. She has heard Him speak of His Father's Kingdom in words so plain and compelling that she can see herself as a child of God once more, a full citizen in this Kingdom of Love. Yes, she is still broken, but now she can see light and hope beyond.</p>
<h3>
How Did She Get Inside?
</h3>
<p>
"It was the custom that when a Rabbi was at a meal in such a house, all kinds of people came in -- they were quite free to do so -- to listen to the pearls of wisdom which fell from his lips." Simon doesn't seem so alarmed that such a woman is in his house, other than that Jesus doesn't perceive what kind of woman she is.</p> 
<p>
This sinful woman doesn't slip in late, either. She has heard that Jesus will be there, and gets to the house even before He does. She must see Jesus again. She must. And so she is waiting with the others when He comes.</p>
<h3>
Tears and Perfume Anointing Jesus' Feet 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"... She brought an alabaster jar of fragrant oil, and stood at His feet behind Him weeping, she began to wash His feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head; and she kissed His feet and anointed them with the fragrant oil." (Luke 7:37-38)</font></p>
<p>
Early in the meal there is no focus on the woman. Simon may feel uncomfortable about her being here, but he does not exclude her from his home. That would have caused an ugly scene. So he allows her to remain. But the focus is clearly on Jesus and His words as he partakes of the meal.</p>
<p>
The woman is standing behind Jesus, and early into the meal she begins to weep. We don't read that she is racked with sobs, but we read that her tears fall upon Jesus' feet. How long this goes on we are not told. Each tear makes a brown wet mark in the dust of his feet, until his feet are wet with her tears.</p>
<p>
Now she unfastens her hair, removing whatever kerchief she may have worn over it, and lets it fall free. She kneels down and begins to wipe his feet with her hair. To go about in public with her hair down was considered a shameful thing to do, yet she is not deterred. Her hair wipes his feet after her tears have washed them.</p>
<p>
Next, she begins to kiss his feet. While we might look at this with sexual connotations, in her culture kissing the feet might be considered a common mark of deep reverence, especially to leading rabbis.

Finally, she pours scented oil onto his feet out of an alabastron (a small type of pottery or glass vessel, or perfume vial), such as Jewish women commonly wore around their neck, and anointed His feet with the fragrant oil.</p>
<p>
I am sure that once the flask of perfume is opened, almost immediately it is detected by everyone in the room. While Jesus has been the centre of focus up to now, all eyes turn to the woman now kneeling at Jesus' feet, weeping, wiping, caressing his feet with her long hair, kissing his feet with her lips, and pouring perfume upon them. The very intimacy of her attentions appear to many of the guests as shocking. Add to that the woman's reputation in the community and this is downright scandalous, at least that is how Simon the Pharisee interprets it.</p>
<h3>
The Pharisee's Judgement 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he spoke to himself, saying, “This Man, if He were a prophet, would know who and what manner of woman this is who is touching Him, for she is a sinner." (Luke 7:39)</font></p>
<p>
It doesn't take much of a mind reader to look at Simon's eyes and read his body language and the expression on his face. Simon acknowledges Jesus as a teacher (Luke 7:40b), but he doubts that Jesus is the prophet as some claim. He judges both the sinful woman and Jesus, and is wrong in both his judgements. It is interesting that he doesn't condemn the action of touching, per se, but Jesus' lack of discernment of who was touching him and her sinful history. He can't be much of a prophet and miss this! Simon huffs to himself.</p>
<h3>
The Parable of Two Cancelled Debts (7:40-43)
</h3>
<p>
But Jesus doesn't let Simon's judgement go unchallenged -- even his silent judgement. Jesus is probably seated at the place of honour to the right of the host.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
And Jesus answered and said to him,, "Simon, I have something to say to you." So he said, “Teacher, say it.”“There was a certain creditor who had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other fifty. And when they had nothing with which to repay, he freely forgave them both. Tell Me, therefore, which of them will love him more?” Simon answered and said, “I suppose the one whom he forgave more.” And He said to him, “You have rightly judged.”  (Luke7:40-43)</font><br
Simon has stepped into the trap.</p>
<h3>
Love as Seen in Acts of Honour (7:44-47)
</h3>
<p>
Instead of judging the woman, as Simon has, Jesus turns the judgement rather to Simon with a series of three comparisons.</p>
<p>
"Then he turned toward the woman and said to Simon, 'Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has washed My feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head. You gave Me no kiss, but this woman has not ceased to kiss My feet since the time I came in. You did not anoint My head with oil, but this woman has anointed My feet with fragrant oil." (Luke 7:44-46)</p>
<p>
Jesus compares Simon's acts as a host to the sinful woman's acts of love.</p>

<p> Simon's Acts </p>                      <p> The Sinful Woman's Acts</p>

<p>No water to wash feet</p>            <p>Washed feet with tears, wiped with hair</p>

<p>No kiss of welcome</p>                      <p>Kissed feet continually </p>

<p>No oil for his guest's hair</p>           <p> Poured perfume on his feet </p>
<p>
Jesus' point isn't hard to guess. Simon's actions have shown little love, while the sinful woman has lavished love upon Jesus. Now building upon His brief parable, Jesus turns the object from love to forgiveness.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Therefore I say to you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little." (Luke 7:47)</font></p>
<p>
To help Simon and the others understand her actions, Jesus first tells a story about forgiveness, and then uses the story to interpret the woman's devotion in terms of forgiveness of sin.</p>
<p>
I can imagine Simon's reaction to this recital -- anger! It puts him in a bad light. It makes him look like the unenthusiastic host that he is. Why should he need forgiveness anyway? He wasn't a sinner!</p>
<h3>
Your Sins Are Forgiven 
</h3>
<p>
But Jesus doesn't linger on Simon's shortcomings. Now he is turns to speak directly to the sinful woman:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Then He said to her, “Your sins are forgiven." (Luke 7:48)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
And those who sat at the table with Him began to say to themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?” (Luke 7:49)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Then He said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you. Go in peace." (Luke 7:50)</font></p>

Now for a question: Were the woman's sins actually forgiven before she came to Simon's house, or at this point where Jesus pronounces them forgiven? I would argue for the former. I think she came with fragrant oil, and wept, and kissed Jesus' feet because she had already reached out in faith and accepted the forgiveness of God that He offered in His teaching. She came because she knew she was forgiven; she came out of gratitude; she came out of love. That conforms well to Jesus' explanation of her actions.</p>
<p>
The guests, however, don't understand. They thought that He was absolving her sins then and there -- and that troubles them because only God could forgive sins (Luke 5:21ff).</p>
<p>
But Jesus continues, looking directly at the woman: "Your faith has saved you; go in peace." He acknowledges that her faith in His promise has brought her salvation. And He bids her the blessing that Jews offer one another in parting: "Shalom." It means not only peace -- and what wonderful peace and light had flooded this woman's soul! -- it also means prosperity and wholeness and goodness and blessing. From one believing Jew to another, Jesus has welcomed her back into the fellowship and salvation of God's people.</p>
<p>
I can see her face shining now. The tears are still flowing, but flowing through the beauty and glory of the countenance of one forever changed and lifted and loved. That, my friends, was a most excellent dinner party! Amen.</p>
