Priority Management and<br> Life Balance
</h1>
<p>
Most people believe that somehow, if they can just find the right system, they can get everything done. I think this is a myth bordering on an outright lie.<br> You can’t do it all. Time is a limited resource. This is just something you have to understand and accept.</p>
<p>
In my experience, the key to work/life balance begins by getting crystal clear on your priorities. I have six, and they are arranged in a specific order:</p>
<p><font size="+1">
God</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">
Self</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">
Family</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">
Work</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">
Church</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">
Everything Else</font></p>
<p>
If you are a Christian, God obviously comes first.<br> Jesus said, <font color= "blue">“But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.” (Matt 6:33)</font>. He is the ultimate priority. Until He is first, everything else will seem out of kilter.</p>
<p>
On a practical level, I read the Bible first thing in the morning. I want to get a divine perspective on things. I also pray in the morning on my commute to work. In addition, I pray before meals, and various points throughout the day, and right before I go to bed. It’s rarely formal. Most often, it’s just an ongoing conversation.</p>
<p>
Perhaps surprising to some people, I come next. That’s right, me. <br>I don’t think this is because I am selfish or ego-centric. It’s because I can’t take care of anyone else unless I take care of myself. If you fly much, you have probably heard the flight attendant say, “In case of an emergency ... put the oxygen mask on yourself first before attempting to help others.” <br>This is how I look at life. I have to attend to myself first in order to help others.</p>
<p>
If I don’t look after my own health and become sick, I am not much use to my family or my employees. This is why I run and try to eat nutritionally sound food. If I don’t get sufficient rest, I get grumpy. No one wants to be around me. This is why I try to sleep a solid seven hours every night.</p>
<p>
Plus, I want to model how to take care of myself, so that my children will take care of themselves. Some people put themselves at the bottom of their priorities, but I think this is nothing more than a false—and dangerous—piety. We are in a much better position to serve others when our basic needs are met.</p>
<p>
My family comes next. Frankly, this was very difficult when the children were little. I had a hard time balancing my work and my life. Sadly, this priority sometimes got shoved to the bottom of the list. Fortunately, this was usually temporary. But I constantly had to fight to keep from neglecting my family. When I got too far astray, my wife would gently reel me in.</p>
<p>
We try to make meal time special. Not to wax too theological, but we see meals as sacramental (small “s”) and a reminder of God’s kingdom. It’s not just a “pit stop” or a refuelling opportunity. Instead, we see it as an opportunity to commune with one another and reconnect with the people we love most.<br>
“The most important gift you can give your children is to love their mother.” How true—especially in an age when broken homes are increasingly the norm.</p>
<p>
With regard to “projects around the house,” I follow Clint Eastwood’s advice in the Dirty Harry movies: “A man has to know his limitations.”<br> I am the most mechanically-challenged person I know. I know the difference between a hammer and a screwdriver. After that, it gets fuzzy.
So, I don’t do a lot of household repairs. I usually ask one of my sons-in-law, hire someone, or—if I wait long enough — my wife will do it. </p>
<p>
After family, my next priority is work. I think it is really important that this come after God, self, and family. I have seen too many people sacrifice the other three on the altar of work. Usually when that happens, their work life crumbles, too. Work can be a rewarding experience if you keep it from becoming an idol. However, if you don’t put it in its place, it can suck the life out of you. <br>No one ever said at the end of their life, “Man, I only wish I had spent more time at the office.”</p>
<p>
After work comes church. I teach an adult Sunday school class. <br>This is my ministry. In addition, I also serve as a deacon. Gail and I have been at the same church for twenty-five years, so our relationships are long and deep. I believe man was created for worship. If we don’t worship God, we generally end up worshipping something else. Church is a great way to start the week on the right foot.</p>
<p>
After that comes everything else. The truth is that I rarely get past the first five priorities. These pretty much make up my life. The bottom line is that you don’t need to get everything done. You only need to get the right things done and leave the rest with God. You’re only human and you can only do so much.</p>
