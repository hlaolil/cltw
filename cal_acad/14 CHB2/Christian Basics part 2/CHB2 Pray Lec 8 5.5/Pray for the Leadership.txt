<h1>
Pray for the Leadership
</h1>
<p>
This prayer guide from the Lord’s Prayer is built for teaching how to pray for Elders and Pastors in your church. I know pastors are asked how their members can pray for them and members desire to pray for their pastors but often aren’t sure how. I hope this guide will encourage all to pray for their pastors and for pastors to know how their congregations are praying for them.</p>
