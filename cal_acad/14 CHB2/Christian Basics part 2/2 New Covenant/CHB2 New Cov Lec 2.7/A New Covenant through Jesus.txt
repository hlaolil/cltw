<h1>
A New Covenant through Jesus
</h1>
<p>
Jesus’ objective on the earth was to initially save His people from their sins. His people were the Jews, who were trying to obey the Law of Moses. The Law of Moses was the Ten Commandments, which later included 613 laws that derived from the original ten.</p>
<h3>
The Reason for the Old Covenant
</h3>
<p>
Although it sounds like an oxymoron, when God gave the Ten Commandments, it wasn’t intended to make the people good. The Law’s ultimate objective was to show people their sins, and demonstrate their need for a Saviour (Rom 3:20, Gal 3:19).  In doing so, it brought sin to the forefront, amplifying the sinfulness of the people. The Law illustrated a glaring separation between God—Who is perfect—and human beings, who are not (2 Cor 3:7, 8). The Law was impossible to obey.  For instance, if a person broke just one of the laws, he was guilty of breaking them all (James 2:10). And when he did, curses, death, guilt, condemnation, and various punishments followed (Deut 28:15-68). The Jewish people sacrificed animals as sin offerings, which temporarily atoned for sin, but it did not permanently bridge the gap between God and mankind (Heb 9:11-29). </p> 
<h3>
Jesus and the New Covenant
</h3>
<p>
The Law is good, perfect, and just because it came from God, Who is good, perfect, and just (Rom 7:7-14). However, the problem with the Law is that it cannot make people good. It constantly shows people their weaknesses, sins, and flaws. Thank God for Jesus being our Saviour! “But when the fullness of time was come, God sent forth his Son, made of a woman, made under the law, to redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons” (Gal 4:4-5). 
Jesus laid down His life as the final and eternal sacrifice for sin (Heb 9:13-14). He took upon His body all the wrath and judgement due to mankind. In other words, He traded places with us. Now, we are eternally loved and forgiven because of Jesus. He serves as the bridge between a perfect God and us. Jesus walked the earth as the personification of grace and truth. When He was born, sin and death reigned upon the earth, but now because of His sacrificial death, grace and truth reigns!</p>
<h3>
About Sin
</h3>
<p>
Does this truth give us liberty to continue in sin with no consequences? (Rom 6:1-2). Of course not! Sin brings upon us all kinds of natural consequences, and causes us to lose confidence in our relationship with God. Sin makes us feel guilty and condemned. It causes us to want to hide from Jesus. However, His grace is sufficient. It gives us the strength to not sin. Ultimately, God’s love and grace turns us away from sin. </p> 
<h3>
The Holy Spirit
</h3>
<p>
Another powerful benefit of the eternal sacrifice of Jesus is the indwelling of the Holy Spirit. Once we are saved, the Holy Spirit dwells within us and sheds abroad the love of God in our hearts (Rom 5:5). He is our Guide, and when we yield to His leadership, we will no longer have the desire to sin (2 Cor 3:18).</p> 
<p>
Jesus’ eternal sacrifice freed us from the Law forever! And whom the Son sets free is free indeed!</p>
