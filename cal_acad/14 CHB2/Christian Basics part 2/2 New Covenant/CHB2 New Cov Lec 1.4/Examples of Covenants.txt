Examples of Covenants

For the life of the flesh is in the blood, (Lev 17:11)</font>  </p>
<p>
In a world where few can be trusted and where friendships only endure as long as there is a perceived personal benefit mankind is always looking to make covenants. He seeks strong and secure relationships for himself and also for his family. He seeks committed friends who will be there for him when enemies rise up against him or when he falls into misfortune. This inner emptiness, this desire for a deep and meaningful connection to a life-giving companion goes back a long way.
In fact it goes back all the way to the relationship man had with God in the Garden of Eden. In those days before the fall of man Adam walked with God. It was in that relationship that Adam found his provision and his delight. After his fall from grace mankind has experienced a deep emptiness within. This inner “angst” is a sense of being alone and cut off from the flows of life.
Blood covenant was amongst the first and oldest of historical traditions.
To increase emotional weight on the covenant ritual blood has to flow to seal the covenant between two partners.</p>
<h3>
Blood Covenant In History
</h3>
<p>
As we know from history, men were most often untrue to their word. Accordingly their covenants were just not trustworthy. Covenants were made and then broken based on personal benefit. If the other covenant partner felt grieved by this broken covenant he might try to force the issue in some way in order to maintain it. If not then the ensuing battle might see a bloody contest and the perpetrators life put in danger. But most of the time he escaped any punishment. Men went on making vows of fidelity without any intention of keeping them. When the covenant was broken the ones who had trusted them were left desolate. This state of affairs has caused untold grief and misery.</p>
<p>
In the resulting insecurity mankind has sought ways out of this dilemma. He has looked for the ultimate covenant. 
In the oldest cuneiform writings we find an example of this. The Gilgamesh Epos tells us the story of the two heroes Gilgamesh and Enkidu. This Sumerian tale dating between 2750 to 2500 BC contains a description of a blood brotherhood that is unforgettable. The two individuals became one single acting unity. Each one lived for the others sake. And so the death of one partner destroyed the meaning of life in the surviving member. There was unity in life till death. The personal advantage of such a deep connection is obvious. This total reliance and confidence in each other enabled these two “Half gods” to overcome the seemingly invincible mountain spirit, Humbaba.
This story been told by gifted storytellers around the camp fires since ancient times. It started to fill the minds of even the youngest listeners. They clearly saw the purpose and the benefit of entering into such a covenant. Here in covenant with a totally committed friend they could find strength, might, invincibility, and security.</p>

<p>
In 1 Sam 18:1-3 we see a similar brotherhood ... Jonathan became one in spirit with David. Even though his father, Saul was at war with David Jonathan loved him as himself. The Bible doesn’t tell us that David and Jonathan sealed a blood covenant in any formal way. But it does describe in detail the love and selfless attitude that ruled their relationship. In the “Song of the Bow” we see David expressing the unspeakable mourning which overwhelmed him when Jonathan, his “other half”, died in the battle at Gilboa. (2 Sam 1)</p>
<p>
In spite of all these idealising stories and the attempts of mankind to see these dreams fulfilled we have to realise that all of these humanistic covenants have been and continue to be broken. If history tells us anything in all this then it must be this fact. Mankind here on this earth is not able to keep any lasting covenant with his fellow man. All the best plans and covenants of the noblest of men eventually fade away and come to nought.</p>
<p>
Nevertheless the desire for such a lasting covenant is still there.
Deep inside of us we have a deep longing for a just and righteous society built with covenants of absolute reliability and trustworthiness.
This desire can’t be fulfilled here on earth – earth is earth – and true covenants must be made from a different material, due to our transience all we create, our covenants, too, will fade away.</p>
<p>
The only covenant partner able to join with us to make an absolutely unbreakable covenant is God. He is beyond time, and space. His ways are far above the transient ways of this world. He is omniscient and all knowing. He is also omnipresent, (all-present), and omnipotent, (all-powerful).
He is the “dream partner” of very human being. </p>
<h3>
The Blood Covenant Between God And Abraham
</h3>
<p>
Abraham entered into covenant with El Shaddai, YHVH, the Almighty God, Creator of heaven and earth. This is described to us in Gen 15:17-21. The word “covenant" means “cutting”. This is how the covenant was “cut”.</p>
<p
God had told Abraham to prepare for a covenant agreement with Him. He was told to slaughter several animals. Following the common ritual of this time Abraham did this. He slaughtered the animals cut them that two halves of the animal would lie on the ground opposite each other. The two parties would then walk around those two halves in a figure of eight path through the blood. In that ritual they would pledge themselves to each other to the extent of all they had, - even to their very lives. In that covenant they would name all the blessings and benefits of the covenant. Then they would name the curses to be exacted should that covenant be violated. There in the bloody ground they would pledge themselves to each other and promise to uphold the covenant requirements come what may. It was a covenant unto death. It was a sombre moment. They affirmed in effect that that, 
“If either one of us violates this covenant then may that person be as this animal that was sacrificed and in whose blood we are now standing.”</p>
<p>
This scripture shows this passing through when the fiery torch (representing God) appeared rushing to and fro between the slaughtered animals.
God is promising Abraham an eternal covenant, everlasting reliability and security but He required an obvious seal of this covenant – the circumcision (Gen 17:1-14).</p>
<p>
This circumcision is an act done in faith. It is a “bloody” ritual too. Every male descendant of Abraham was required bear this covenant mark. In Gen 17:13 God is repeating His promise confirming the eternal character of this covenant, but the following verse gives us the clear consequences if this covenant should ever be broken. It is the death of the perpetrator.
This point is very important. We shall refer to this later. But now let us take a closer look at the most holy covenant of all – the Blood covenant.</p>
<p>
This was the covenant God made with Abraham – and this covenant is available till today!
God is the “dream partner” of very human being. Is it possible for a man, woman, or child to enter into a blood covenant with Him?
If you would become one with Him, then it would no longer be just “you”. It would not even be just “you” and ”Him”.
Rather, it would also be “we” with Him. 
You would have sealed the ultimate covenant.</p>
<p>
But this covenant has a price, it will cost you the utmost you can give. It will cost you your very life. You have been called to lay down your own life to receive His life. You have to die that He will live in you.

Let us take a look at this covenant in detail.
<h3>
The Eternal Blood Covenant
</h3>
<p>
Every covenant sealed by man was always grounded in the agreement of two covenant parties. They pondered about the cost / benefit factor and vowed loyalty to each other for consensual benefit.</p>
<p>
Whereas God chose a different way to show us His way to the ultimate covenant:
<p><font color= "blue">
Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down his life for his friends.
(John 15:13)</font></p>
<p>
In this scripture Jesus says that He gave the ultimate sign of His love as He was slaughtered before a covenant partner was there.
This death of Jesus Christ isn’t just the atonement of our sins alone. It is the ultimate covenant, the most magnificent covenant ever been made available to man. 
No other covenant has had such dramatic consequences. No other covenant has cost such a high price.</p>
<p>
In Matt 26 we read the following words:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, and gave it to the disciples and said, “Take, eat; this is My body.” Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you. For this is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. But I say to you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father’s kingdom.”. (Matt 26:26-29)</font> </p>
<p>
This is not just some other form of a covenant. Rather it is the most high covenant available. We are talking here about a blood covenant backed up by God Himself! This covenant brings man into communion and unity with God. In this covenant we become partakers of God’s character.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
that they all may be one, as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; that they also may be one in Us, that the world may believe that You sent Me. 22 And the glory which You gave Me I have given them, that they may be one just as We are one:
(John 17:21-22)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Beloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is. (1 John 3:2)</font></p>
<p>
These scripture show us the mind-boggling dimensions of this new covenant. This covenant goes beyond the grasp of our human imagination.</p>
<p>
But just as it was with Abraham this covenant has a condition we must fulfil. With Abraham it was the circumcision God was demanding from him and his descendants. The ultimate covenant, the New Covenant, has a condition too. Like circumcision it may involve blood, even the cutting off and death of our flesh-life. Our Apostle Paul speaks of this as a circumcision of the heart. (Rom 2:29) We are not speaking here about our physical death, although that does happen to God’s witnesses. No, this death is meant for our dreams, desires and the ruling, (or misruling), of our life by our own fleshly desires. Everything that resists this total, overall surrender to God’s hand has to die. Jesus says:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake will find it. (Matt 16:25)</font></p>
<p>
Paul expresses it the following way:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. (Phil 1:21) </font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptised into Christ Jesus were baptised into His death? Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be in the likeness of His resurrection. (Rom 6:3-5)</font></p>
<p>
Jesus says:
<font color= "blue">In the same way, any of you who does not give up everything he has cannot be my disciple. (Luke 14:33)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much grain. He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My servant will be also. If anyone serves Me, him My Father will honor.
(John 12:24-26)</font></p>
<p>
The New Covenant has its price. And yes I realise that this price is hardly spoken about in today’s wealthy Christendom. Jesus is the One who saves and heals and performs miracles this is true. But today a watered-down version of Jesus is preached. He is portrayed as some sort of generous doting super-wealthy merchant who just stands there and hands out blessings free for the asking. 
But the story is only half told. We are the agents of the Great King. The covenant conditions required to flow in God’s anointing are there. But they have been hidden from view. These conditions are deliberately withheld from most believers for reasons of keeping Christianity easy for half-committed people to enter in. Maintaining popularity and “customer satisfaction” is the thing. The main goal in the post-modern merchant church is to make the narrow way the broad way. This is done to keep up the numbers on church rolls and raise the Christian television ratings.</p>
<p>
In spite of this ignorance and our lack of good performance the covenant God has given us is still valid. But all the wonderful promises tied to this covenant cannot be activated if we do not meet the conditions. 
God’s word gives us clear vision concerning the consequences we can to expect should we misrepresent Him:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Therefore whoever eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup. For he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgement to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body. For this reason many are weak and sick among you, and many sleep. (have died). (1 Cor 11:27-30)</font></p>
<p>
Let us remember God’s covenant with Abraham. There God commanded that everyone trespassing against this covenant should be annihilated.
Our New Covenant through Jesus Christ has awful consequences as well for those who misrepresent Him.</p>
<p> 
Similarly the Lord’s Supper is not just a church ritual. No, it is a holy covenant with our God. Death and sickness, unnecessary pain and sorrow, spiritual ineffectiveness and paralysis are the consequences for those who are not willing to fulfil our covenant part.
No amount of church showmanship or clever religious marketing can help us here.
The Lord’s Supper is a blood covenant ritual, a holy act. Only those who are willing to lay themselves on the altar and die to themselves should partake. 
If we are unwilling to do this we should not be taking communion at all.</p>
<p>
Right now many readers will think, “Nobody has ever told me this!”
Let us pause and be silent for a moment. Ask God for a revelation of His will deep inside of you. It is of crucial importance that we stop painting our own human pictures of God. We have to accept Him as He is. 
The highest and most glorious promises have been given to us. But where can you find them in the western churches today? Where are the believers displaying the glory of the Lord? Why do we see spiritual sickness and death everywhere?</p>
<p>
Brothers and sisters it is time to change the direction of our lives. It is time for us to flip the steering wheel and to turn around and go in a new direction. But for this we need a clear vision of where we are spiritually right now:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
And to the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write, "These things says the Amen, the Faithful and True Witness, the Beginning of the creation of God: “I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I could wish you were cold or hot. So then, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of My mouth. Because you say, "I am rich, have become wealthy, and have need of nothing"—and do not know that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked— I counsel you to buy from Me gold refined in the fire, that you may be rich; and white garments, that you may be clothed, that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and anoint your eyes with eye salve, that you may see. As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Therefore be zealous and repent. Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me. To him who overcomes I will grant to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne.
“He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.”
(Rev 3:14-22)</font></p>
<p>
God is waiting for you. He awaits your return to HIS covenant. He has fulfilled His part 2000 years ago. His covenant stands unshakable. Now He is calling you. Everyone is called to experience the benefits and riches of this covenant. And everyone who is willing to pay the price will enter into this glorious destiny. That price is the death of our own self life, our own fleshly desires, (the id), and our own ego.
</p>
God speaks the following words:</p>
<p>
Gather My saints together to Me, those who have made a covenant with Me by sacrifice. (Psa 50:5)</p>
<p>
There is a place where we can meet our covenant partner. There is a place where He is waiting for you. It is at the altar of sacrifice. There you will meet Him. At this place where you stop being merely a life unto yourself. Where your own life will be consumed by the fire of dedication and selfless love you will find your life again. You will find it in Him!</p>
<p>
Become a overcomer! The glory of God is awaiting you!</p>
