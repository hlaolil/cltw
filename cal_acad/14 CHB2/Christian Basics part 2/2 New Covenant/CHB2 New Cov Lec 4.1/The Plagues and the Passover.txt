<h1>
The Plagues and the Passover
</h1>
<p>
God commissioned Moses to confront Pharaoh, the Egyptian king:<font color= "blue"> “Thus says the Lord God of Israel: "Let My people go" ...” (Ex 5:1).</font></p>
<h3>
The Nine Plagues
</h3>
<p>
According to the book of Exodus, when Pharaoh hardened his heart and refused to let the Israelites leave Egypt, God brought a series of devastating “plagues” upon the people of the Nile. The visitation of these judgements echoes down the corridors of Bible history (Psa 78:43-51; 105:28-36; 106:21-22; Jer 32:20-21; Neh 9:10; Acts 7:36; Rev 8:7-11, etc.).</p>
<p>
Egypt was a land of thousands of gods, and the Israelite people were not unaffected by the idolatry of these polytheists. This is reflected in the worship of a golden calf at Sinai (Ex 32:1-6), and later in Israel’s history as well (1 Kings 12:28-29).</p>
<p>
The plagues were intended to be a “smiting blow” (Ex 9:15; 12:13) of judgement against the “gods” of Egypt, as well as “signs” or “wonders” of divine intervention (Psa 78:43;105:27). Each of the plagues was designed to neutralise confidence in the false deities of Egypt.</p>
<p>
For example, several gods were associated with the Nile River. When the water was thus turned to blood, the reputation of the river deities was destroyed. When the cattle were afflicted with disease, it was a blow to Apis, the bull god. The sun was darkened for three days; thus the light from Ra and other sun gods was shut off.</p>
<p>
The plagues came at the bidding of Moses and Aaron under God’s direction, not at the whims of nature (Ex 7:19; 9:22, etc.). The timing was crucial. Also, Israel was unaffected by the plagues.</p>
<h3>
The Tenth Plague and the Passover
</h3>
<p>
The tenth plague involved the death of first-born Egyptians (men and cattle), including Pharaoh’s son, who was alleged to be a “full blooded” god by birth. According to Ex 12, a year-old male lamb (or goat), without blemish, was to be slain on the 14th day of the first month of the Hebrew religious year, “between the evenings” (Ex 12:6).</p>
<p>
The lamb was killed between 3 and 5 p.m. but none of its bones was to be broken (Ex 12:46). The blood was to be smeared on the door posts and lintel of every Israelite home, and the Lord promised: <font color= "blue">“When I see the blood, I will pass over you” (Ex 12:13).</font></p>
<p>
The passover lamb was a prophetic picture of the Lord Jesus and His atoning death. The Saviour was introduced by John the Baptiser as <font color= "blue">“the lamb of God” (John. 1:29).</font> Paul emphatically stated that <font color= "blue">“Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed for us" (1 Cor 5:7).</font></p>
<p>
Jesus was “without blemish,” i.e., sinless (1 Peter 1:19; 2:22), and during the crucifixion not a one of His bones was broken (John. 19:31-33). He died at 3 o’clock in the afternoon (Matt 27:46), and His blood became a propitiation for sin (Rom. 3:25) — for all who access the application of it by obedience to His will (Heb 5:9). We are cleansed by His blood (Heb 9:14) when we receive the word (the gospel), and submit to immersion (Eph 5:26).</p>
