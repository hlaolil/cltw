The Passover Ritual
</h1>
<h3>
Instructions
</h3>
<p>
God, being about to smite with death the first-born in each Egyptian house, required the Israelites to save themselves by means of a sacrifice. Each Israelite householder was to select a lamb (or a kid) on the tenth day of the current month (Ex 12:3), and to keep it separate from the flock until the fourteenth day at even, when he was to kill it, to dip some hyssop in the blood (Ex 12:22) and to strike with the hyssop on the two posts and lintel of his doorway (Ex 12:7), so leaving the mark of the blood on it. He was then the same night to roast the lamb whole, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs (Ex 12:8-10). He was to have his dress close girt about him, his sandals on his feet, and his staff in his hand; to be prepared, that is, for a journey. If he did all this, God, when he went through the land to smite and destroy, would "pass over" the house upon which there was the blood, and spare all that dwelt in it. Otherwise the plague would be upon them to destroy them (Ex 12:11, Ex 12:13). Such were the directions given for immediate observance, and such was the Passover proper. The lamb itself was primarily the Pesach (Ex 12:11), the "pass," which secured safety. From this the name spread to the entire festival. Having, by the directions recorded in Ex 12:3-13 instituted the festival, God proceeded, in Ex 12:14-20, to require its continued celebration year after year, and to give additional rules as to the mode of its annual observance.</p>
<p>
1. The festival was to last seven days</p>
<p>
2. No leavened bread was to be eaten during that space, and leaven was even to be put away altogether out of all houses.</p>
<p>
3. On the first day of the seven and on the last, there was to be "a holy convocation" or gathering for worship.</p>
<p>
4. No work not strictly necessary was to be done on these days.</p>
<p>
Other directions were given at a later date.</p>
<p>
1. Besides the Paschal lamb, with which the festival commenced, and which was to be a domestic rite, public sacrifices were appointed for each day of the seven — to consist of two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs, and one goat, with appropriate "meat-offerings" (Num 28:19-24).</p>
<p>
2. On the second day of the feast, "the morrow after the Sabbath," the first fruits of the harvest were to be presented in the shape of a ripe sheaf (of barley) which was to be a wave-offering, and to be accompanied by the sacrifice of a lamb with meat and drink offerings (Lev 23:10-14). By this regulation the festival was made to embody the old spring feast, and to have thus a double aspect.</p>
<h3>
Speak to all the congregation. 
</h3>
<p>
Under the existing circumstances Moses could only venture to summon the elders of Israel to a meeting. He necessarily left it to them to signify his wishes to the people. (See Ex 12:21.) A lamb. The Hebrew word is one of much wider meaning than our "lamb." It is applicable to both sheep and goats, and to either animal without limit of age, In the present case the age was fixed at a year by subsequent enactment (Ex 12:5); but the offerer was left free with respect to the species. It is curious that, such being the case, the lamb alone should, so far as appears, ever have been offered. According to the house of their fathers. Literally, "for a father's house," i.e. for a family.</p>
<h3>
Your lamb shall be without blemish. 
</h3>
<p>
Natural piety would teach that "the blind, the lame, and the sick" should not be selected for sacrifice (Malachi 1:8). The Law afterwards expressly forbade any blemished animals—"blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed"—to be offered for any of the stated sacrifices, though they might be given as free-will offerings (Ex 22:20-25). The absence of blemish was especially important in a victim which was to typify One "holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners." A male. As standing in place of and redeeming the first-born of the males in each family. Of the first year. Perhaps as then more approaching to the ideal of perfect innocence. When people were poor, their richer neighbours supplied them with lambs.
<h3>
You shall keep it up until the fourteenth day 
</h3>
<p>
The interval of four days (see Ex 12:3) was probably intended to give ample time for the thorough inspection of the lamb, and for obtaining another, if any defect was discovered. The precept is not observed by the modern Jews; and the later Targum (which belongs to the sixth century after Christ) teaches that it was only intended to apply to the first institution; but the text of Exodus is wholly against this. The whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it. One of the main peculiarities of the Paschal sacrifice was this — that the head of each family was entitled — in the early times was required to offer the sacrifice for himself. 
<h3>
They shall take of the blood 
</h3>
<p>
The blood, which, according to Hebrew ideas, "is the life," and so the very essence of the sacrifice, was always regarded as the special symbol of that expiation and atonement, with a view to which sacrifice was instituted. As by the Paschal sacrifice atonement was made for the house, which was therefore to escape unscathed, the sign of atonement was to be conspicuously placed upon it. And strike. The "striking" was to be by means of a bunch of hyssop dipped in the blood (Ex 12:22). The selection of the doorway as the part of the house to receive the stains of blood is probably to be connected with the idea that the secondary agency producing death, whatever it was, would enter by the door—and if the door showed the house to have been atoned for, would not enter. The upper door-post or lintel (Ex 12:22, Ex 12:23).</p>
<h3>
Roast with firs
</h3>
<p>
The meat of sacrificial meals was commonly boiled by the Hebrews (1 Sam 2:14, 1 Sam 2:15). The command to roast the Paschal lamb is accounted for:</p>
<p>
1. By its being a simpler and quicker process than boiling;</p>
<p>
2. By a special sanctity being regarded as attaching to fire;</p>
<p>
3. By the difficulty of cooking the animal whole unless it were roasted. And unleavened bread. With bitter herbs. Literally, "with bitternesses." That herbs, or vegetables of some kind, are intended, there is no reasonable doubt. The Mishna enumerates endive, chicory, wild lettuce, and nettles among the herbs that might be eaten. 
<h3>
Don't Eat it Raw. 
</h3>
<p>
The injunction appears to us superfluous; but eating of the raw flesh of victims sacrificed, seems to have been practised by several heathen nations in ancient times, more especially in the worship of Dionysus or Bacchus. 
<h3>
Let nothing of it remain till the morning. 
</h3>
<p>
The whole of the flesh was to be consumed by the guests, and at one sitting, lest there should be any even accidental profanation of the food by man or animal, if part were put away. That which remains — i.e; the bones, and any small fragments of the flesh necessarily adhering to them. You shall burn with fire. Thus only could its complete disappearance, and seeming annihilation be secured. It does not appear that this burning was viewed as a sacrificial act.</p>
<h3>
With your loins girded
</h3>
<p>
Completely prepared, i.e; to start on your journey—with the loose wrapper, ordinarily worn, collected together and fastened by a girdle about the waist; with sandals on the feet, which were not commonly worn in houses; and with walking-sticks in the hand. There were some Jews who regarded these directions as of perpetual obligation; but the general view was that they applied to the first occasion only, when alone they would have answered any useful purpose. You shall eat it in haste. As not knowing at what moment you may be summoned to start on your journey, and as having to see to the burning of the bones after the flesh was eaten, which would take some time. It is the Lord's Passover. Very emphatic words! "This is no common meal," they seem to say, "it is not even an ordinary sacrificial repast. The lamb is God's. It is His pass-sign—the mark of His protection, the precious means of your preservation from death. As such view it; and though you eat it in haste, eat it with reverence."</p>
<h3>
The Tenth Plague
</h3>
<p>
For I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night, and will strike all the first born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgement: I am the Lord. Ex 12:12 
A sudden mortality among the sacred animals would be felt by the Egyptians as a blow struck against the gods to whom they belonged, and as a judgement upon them. It is scarcely necessary to understand literally the expression "all the gods," and to defend it by the assertion that "not a single deity of Egypt but was represented by some beast." </p>
<h3>
The blood shall be to you for a token 
</h3>
<p>
The blood was not to be a token to the Israelites, but to God for them. God would pass by, or over the house on which the blood was, spare it, slay none of its inmates; and from this action of His, the lamb itself, and the feast whereof it was the principal part, were to be termed "the Passover." </p>
<h3>
Directions for the Celebration of the Passover
</h3>
<p>
Now, the Celebration was announced,</p>
<p>
(a) the eating of unleavened bread for seven days after the killing of the Passover;</p>
<p>
(b) the putting away of leaven out of the houses;</p>
<p>
(c)the holding of meetings for worship on the first day and the last; and</p>
<p>
(d) the observance on these days of a sabbatical rest.</p>
<h3>
Passover to be commemorated 
</h3>
<p>
This day shall be to you for a memorial. Annual festivals, in commemoration of events believed to have happened, were common in the religion of Egypt, and probably not wholly strange to the religious ideas of the Hebrews. They were now required to make the 14th of Abib such a day, and to observe it continually year after year "throughout their generations." There is commendable faithfulness in the obedience still rendered to the command at the present day; and it must be confessed that the strong expression—throughout your generations and as an ordinance for ever — excuse to a great extent the reluctance of the Jews to accept Christianity. </p>
<p>
The Church requires an Easter communion of all her members, proclaims that on that day, Christ our passover being slain, we are to keep the feast; and thus, so far as in her lies, maintains the festival as "an ordinance for ever," to be observed through all her generations.</p>
<h3>
Unleavened bread for Seven days.  
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. On the first day you shall remove leaven from your houses. For whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel.(Ex 12:15)</font> 
Unleavened bread is typical of purity of heart, leaven being an emblem of corruption (Matt 16:6-12; 1 Cor 5:7). "Leaven," says Plutarch, "comes from corruption, and corrupts the dough with which it is mixed; and every fermentation seems to be a putrefaction." The primary command to celebrate the first passover with unleavened instead of leavened bread (Gen 29:8), must be attributed wholly to this symbolism. But the permanent institution of a "feast of unleavened bread," to last a week, had a double bearing. Partly, it was designed to deepen and intensify the conviction that corruption and impurity disqualify for religions service; but it was also partly intended as a commemoration of the fact, that in their hasty flight from Egypt the bread which they took with them was unleavened. The requirement to "put away leaven out of their houses" is probably intended to teach, that for family worship to be acceptable, the entire household must be pure, and that to effect this result the head of the household must, so far as he can, eject the leaven of sin from his establishment. Who ever eats ... shall be out off from Israel. Expelled, i.e, from the congregation, or excommunicated. If a man wilfully transgresses any plain precept of God, even though it be a positive one, he should be severed from the Church, until he confess his fault, and repent, and do penance for it. Such was the, "godly discipline" of the primitive Church; and it would be good if the Churches of these modern times had more of it.</p>
<h3>
A Holy Convocation
</h3>
<p>
On the first day there shall be a holy convocation (assembly). After the Paschal meal on the evening of the 14th of Abib, there was to be a solemn assembly of the people on the next day for religions worship. But absolute cessation from all work was nowhere strictly commanded except among the Hebrews, where it appears to have been connected with the belief in God's absolute rest after the six days of creation. The command here given was solemnly repeated in the law (Ex 23:6-8).
<h3>
Only eat unleavened bread
</h3>
<p>
Here again there is no repetition, but an extension. <font color= "blue">"You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your dwellings you shall eat unleavened bread.” (Ex 12:15)</font>, but no leavened cake of any kind. And "in all your habitations shall you eat unleavened bread," i.e; wherever you dwell, whether in Egypt, or in the wilderness, or in Palestine, or in Babylonia, or in Media, this law shall be observed. So the Jews observe it everywhere to this day, though they no longer sacrifice the Paschal lamb.</p>
