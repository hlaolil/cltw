<h3>
Spiritual death
</h3>
<p>
Paul begins by telling his readers: <font color= "blue">"And you He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins, in which you once walked according to the course of this world" (Eph 2:1-2)</font>. All humans start in a state of spiritual death, whether we have many transgressions or only a few. A life not oriented to God is dead.</p>
<p>
Paul is talking about average people, socially respectable people. When they followed<font color= "blue"> "according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience," (Eph 2:2)</font>. In living the way they thought best, they were unwittingly imitating the devil and disobeying God.</p>
<p>
Christians did it, too: "we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath" (Eph 2:3). We lived with no thought other than to take care of our desires, and as a result, we were objects of wrath — <font color= "blue">under the righteous judgement of God, (Rom 2:5)</font>.</p>
<h3>
Spiritual life
</h3>
<p>
But God's wrath is not the end of the story: <font color= "blue">"But God, who is rich in mercy, because of His great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in trespasses, made us alive together with Christ (by grace you have been saved)," (Eph 2:4-5)</font>. The judge of all humanity is full of mercy, and even when we were guilty and without excuse, He forgave us. Insofar as we sin, we are dead, but as much as we are in Christ, we are alive.</p>
<p>
Life in Christ is much more than the physical existence we are familiar with — our new life has a different quality to it, a heavenly quality, an eternal quality. When we become Christians, our identity changes. We become new people. The old self dies, and a new person lives. We died with Christ, we were buried with Christ, and we also live with Christ.</p>
<p>
" and raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus," (Eph 2:6). Those who have faith in Christ are seated with Him in glory. It is so sure that Paul can say that it has been done.</p>
<p>
God did this <font color= "blue">"that in the ages to come He might show the exceeding riches of His grace in His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus." (Eph 2:7)</font>. God's grace is already at work in our lives, but the extent of His grace will be revealed with much greater clarity in the future.</p>
<p>
Paul then summarises the way God is working: "For by grace you have been saved, through faith — and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God" (Eph 2:8). In Greek, the words grace and faith are feminine, but Paul uses a neuter form of the word this. Paul is not saying that faith is a gift of God, or that grace is a gift of God — they are, but here Paul is saying that all of salvation is a gift of God. None of it comes from from ourselves — "not of works, lest anyone should boast" (Eph 2:9). No one can brag about having faith or works. Since God has done it, he gets all the credit.</p>
<p>
"For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk in them." (Eph 2:10). Even our good works are a result of the way God is working in us. He created us for his purpose, to do his will.</p>
<p>
Paul expects believers to be obedient. He says that we used to be disobedient, but that in Christ we are created anew, so that we might have a different foundation for how we live. This new life is a result of our salvation, not the cause of it. Our works should be good, but they can never be good enough that we deserve to be saved. We are saved by grace, by God's mercy and love, through Jesus Christ.</p>
<h3>
Unity in Christ
</h3>
<p>
Paul then begins to address a practical matter within the church, the tensions between Jewish and gentile believers. Because we are saved by grace and because we are saved for good works, our attitudes and behaviour toward one another ought to change.</p>
<p>
He begins by writing to the gentiles: <font color= "blue"></font>"Therefore remember that you, once Gentiles in the flesh — who are called Uncircumcision by what is called the Circumcision made in the flesh by hands — that at that time you were without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers from the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world" (Eph 2:11-12)</font>.</p>
<p>
The Jews looked down on the gentiles, calling them "uncircumcised." This insult was a reminder than the gentiles were not in the covenant of Abraham and not included in the blessings promised to him. Although circumcision was a human work, it reflected a spiritual reality. The gentiles were separated from Christ, God, hope and promise. But that has now changed: <font color= "blue">"But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ." (Eph 2:13)</font>. Once they were separated from Christ; now they are united with him. Once they were excluded; now they are included. They have hope, and they have God, through the death of Jesus Christ.</p>
