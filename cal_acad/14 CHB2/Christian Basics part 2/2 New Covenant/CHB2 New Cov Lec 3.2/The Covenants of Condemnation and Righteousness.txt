<h1>
The Covenants of Condemnation and Righteousness
</h1>
<p>
The law of the Old Covenant and the law of the New Covenant are not the same. The Bible clearly distinguishes the two.</p>
<h3>
Here are some basics
</h3>
<p>
The law we Christians have is called the law of Christ. <font color= "blue">"Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ." (Gal 6:2)</font>. 
Jesus called His law a new commandment.<font color= "blue"> "A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another.” (John 13:34)</font>. 
It is further broken down into many other commandments found in the New Testament. 
The relationship between Old Covenant law and New Covenant law is not one of equality, nor one of basic and more detailed, nor one of v 1.0 and v 2.0, nor even one of good and improved. Rather, the relationship of Old Covenant law to New Covenant law is one of type and antitype.</p>
<h3>
Old Testament Laws
</h3>
<p>
Old Testament laws, including the Ten Commandments, were mere shadows or types of New Testament commands. 
Even the Old Testament Sabbath command was a shadow of God’s true rest in Christ that Christians have entered. There is no Sabbath day for Christians to keep because we rest from our sinful works every day in Christ. He is our Sabbath rest. 
The Decalogue was external, written on stone. The New Covenant commands are internal, written on our hearts. 
Under the Old Covenant, the law could only condemn.<font color= "blue"> "For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one that who does not continue in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them" (Gal 3:10)</font>.</p>
<h3>
New Covenant law
</h3>
<p> 
New Covenant law does not condemn. <font color= "blue">"There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit" (Rom 8:1)</font>.</p>
<p>
New Covenant theologians, in saying that the Old Covenant law has ended, are often accused of taking away the basis for morality. But the Bible teaches the opposite. Being free from Old Covenant law — the law of sin and death — does not cause us to give in to fleshly desires. In fact, <font color= "blue">"sin taking opportunity by the commandment, produced in me all manner of evil desire. For apart from the law sin was dead" (Rom 7:8)</font>. In other words, far from causing Christians to give in to fleshly desires, being free from Old Covenant law has the opposite effect!</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
 For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace.. (Rom 8:2-6)</font></p>

The table below shows some of the differences between the Old Covenant law and the New Covenant law of Christ and illustrates the striking dichotomy between the two. After the table, I'll answer a question about how Christians are not under the law and yet are not without law.

In closing, I'll answer this question: Do Rom 6:14 and 1 Cor 9:21 contradict?

No, they do not.  Paul says, <font color= "blue">"For sin shall not have dominion over you: for you are not under the law, but under grace." (Rom 6:14)</font> This tells us that sin cannot rule us because we are not under law (there is no definite article before the word "law" in the Greek), but under grace. Thus, we are neither under Israel's Old Covenant law given to Moses on Mount Sinai nor any other law. It also tells us that we are under grace, which means that no law can condemn us in God's eyes.</p>
<p>
Now let's look at this verse in the context of Paul explaining how he tries to be all things to all men in his preaching of the Gospel: <font color= "blue">"to those who are without law, as without law (not being without law toward God, but under law toward Christ), that I might win those who are without law;" (1 Cor 9:21)</font> The point in question is that Paul says he is not really without law but "under the law to Christ." So, how can we be "not under law" (as stated in Rom 6:14) and also be "under the law to Christ"?

The answer is found in the fact that the King James Version and some other versions poorly translate the Greek behind the phrase "under the law to Christ." The three places where this verse says "without law" are translated from the Greek word anomos, which is an adjective that literally means "no lawed" or "lawless." "Under the law" is translated from the Greek word ennomos. This word literally means "in-lawed." In just the previous verse (verse 20), Paul used the phrase "under the law" three times. These three instances of "under the law" are translated from hupo nomon, and "under law" is the correct translation. But in verse 21, ennomos should be translated "in-lawed." Paul is saying he is not really without law to God but he is in-lawed to Christ. That is, the Christian's relationship to law is only to Christ's law, and that relationship to Christ's law is dependent on his being in Christ. In Christ, who is the New Covenant (Isa 49:7-8; 1 Cor 11:25), we are lawful or righteous because of Christ's righteousness. Jesus died for our past sins (Rom 3:25), and He has done all of the rest, too. We are lawful because of His death and life for us. Thus, we can say that we are not under any external law, such as the Old Covenant, but we are lawful because we are in Christ and in the New Covenant. In this state, nothing can condemn us because Christ's perfect righteousness is also our righteousness. Although we may still struggle with our flesh, being in Christ, we have already gained the victory: <font color= "blue">"But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Cor 15:57)</font>.</p>
<p>
Thus, there is no contradiction between Rom 6:14 and 1 Cor 9:21. We are not under law; we are under grace, and we are under grace because we are in Jesus Christ with His righteousness imputed to us and because we are in the New Covenant. We are not under the New Covenant's laws; we are under grace. The New Covenant's laws are in us, written on our hearts. That is, they are internalised. They contain no condemnation and can never impute sin. So, we are under grace, in Christ, with the New Covenant laws in us motivating us to walk after the Spirit: <font color= "blue">"There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit. For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death" (Rom 8:1-2)</font>.</p>

He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things? Who shall bring a charge against God’s elect? It is God who justifies. Who is he who condemns? It is Christ who died, and furthermore is also risen, who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intercession for us. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written: “For Your sake we are killed all day long;
We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come,  nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Rom 8:32-39)</font></p>
