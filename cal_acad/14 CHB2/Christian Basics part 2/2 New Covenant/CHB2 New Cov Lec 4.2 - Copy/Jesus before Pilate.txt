Jesus before Pilate
</h1>
<h3>
Secular Trials
</h3>
<p>
The secular trials started with the Roman procurator, Pontius Pilate. The charges levied against Christ by the high priest and Sanhedrin, were completely different than those charges presented to Pilate.</p>
<p>
Whereas He was charged with blasphemy in Ecclesiastical Trials, He was charged with inciting people to riot, forbidding people to pay taxes and prays in my claiming to be a King in place of Caesar.</p>

Pilate found no reason for death in him,<font color= "blue"> And as soon as he knew that He belonged to Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem at that time.
(Luke 23:7)</font></p>
<p>
Herod mocked Jesus but desired to avoid any political liability or repercussion from the masses, <font color= "blue"></font>Then Herod, with his men of war, treated Him with contempt and mocked Him, arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe, and sent Him back to Pilate. (Luke 23:11)</font>.</p>
<p>
Pilate attempted to sway the crowd by having Jesus scourged with thirty nine lashes of cat-of-nine-tails whip.
When this did not quell the mob, Pilate attempted to offer of Barabbas to be crucified in Jesus released, which the mob rejected, choosing Barabbas rather than Christ.
Finally in frustration, against his stated better judgement that Christ did not deserve death, Pilate ceremonially dipped his hands in water claiming to be innocent of the blood of Jesus, with the crowd chanting that the blood of Christ should be on their head.
<h3>
Trials Sequence
</h3>
Trial no. 1:    Jesus was taken to Annas. (Mark 14:53; John 18:13-24)  Annas was the original (former) High Priest, however, the Romans in order to reinforce their own the power, placed his son-in-law, Caiaphas, as the current High Priest. And while Caiaphas, was the high priest of record, the Sanhedrin still look to Annas as the true high priest.
Trial no. 2:    Jesus was taken before Caiaphas. (Matt 26:57-68; John 18:24-28)
Trial no. 3:    Jesus reviewed before the Sanhedrin. (Luke 22:66-71)

<h3>
History & Authenticity
</h3>
<p>
Starting with Isa 52:13 until Isa 53:12; these 15 versus layout prophecies concerning the last few hours of Christ’s life with such exactness, that many have claimed that it was written after the crucifixion.

However, due to landmarks secular events such as, the translation of the Hebrew scripture to Greek started in 285 B.C. and completed in 70 A.D., known as the Septuagint included these passages.

Also, the 1947 through 1949 excavations at Qumran, commonly referred to as the Dead Sea Scrolls also contained these rather amazing predictions.

The Question at Hand
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“He was oppressed and He was afflicted, yet He opened not His mouth; He was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, so He opened not His mouth.” (Isa 53:7)</font>

Yet we know, after Christ to been asked if He was the Christ the Son of the Blessed,  Jesus said, <font color= "blue">“I am. And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.” (Mark 14:62)</font>
<p><font color= "blue">
Then Pilate asked Him, “Are You the King of the Jews?” He answered and said to him, “It is as you say.” (Mark 15:2)</font>

How can we then reconcile Isa 53:7, which states that the Messiah would be silent before His accusers, and yet those gospel accounts which records Christ responding to them.</p>
<h3>
The Answer
</h3>
<p>
First off it must be noted that the figurative language of Isa 53, which referred to a literal situation, concerned the Messiah giving no defence of Himself.

The understanding of the text is that when accused an innocent of the crime, he would not defend himself, even in spite of the fact that to do so might save his life.</p>
<p>
Secondly, Jesus stated that he would fulfil all righteousness (Matthew 3:15), and when Jesus responded to the high priest it was according to maintaining the requirements of the Torah, as it was a requirement that the accused would answer the questions of the high priest when the high priest would invoke the name of God.

When we read of this account, it makes more sense concerning the responsibility that Jesus fulfilled by answering the oath of the High Priest (as seen in Num 5:19,21).</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest answered and said to Him, “I put You under oath by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God!”
(Matt 26:63)</font>
Also it is believed that when Jesus responded to the governor, Pontius Pilate, by stating: “it is as you say,” that He again was following this requirement of the Torah.</p>
<p>
This in consideration of Peter’s proclamation that there are no powers that are not in force with out God’s control, and this proved to be a witness and of the Gentiles as well.
<p><font color= "blue">
“Therefore submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord’s sake, whether to the king as supreme, or to governors, as to those who are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of those who do good. For this is the will of God, that by doing good you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men— as free, yet not using liberty as a cloak for vice, but as bond servants of God. Honour all people. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the king.” (1 Peter 2:13-17)</font></p>
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
Therefore, Christ answering as he did fulfilled the prophecies concerning Him making no defence, yet also following the Torah, as well as the will of God.

It is God, and God alone who can always fulfil His Word, as well as His Will; even when these situations appear to be at odds against each other, never contradicting Himself in the effort.</p>
