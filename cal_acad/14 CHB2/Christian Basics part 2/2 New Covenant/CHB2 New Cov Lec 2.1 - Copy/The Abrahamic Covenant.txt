The Abrahamic Covenant

<h3>
Abraham in Genesis
</h3>
<p>
In terms of the number of chapters given over to him, Abraham is clearly the most important of all the human characters in Genesis. Moreover, his life marks an important watershed in God’s relationship with human beings. Although there are in chapters 3-11 indications that divine mercy will triumph over the consequences of the fall, it is with Abraham that a clearer picture begins to emerge. The divine promises associated with his call (Gen 12:1-3) reveal that he is to play a central role in the restoration of humanity’s broken relationship with God.
<h3>
Overview of the Abraham narrative
</h3>
<p>
The Abraham narrative falls into two sections separated by a brief genealogy in Gen 22:20-24; the main section consists of Gen 11:27-22:19, with Gen 23:1-25:11 forming an appendix. Running through the main section are three closely intertwined themes concerning seed, land and blessing. Not only are these themes significant within the Abraham narrative, but they may also be traced throughout the whole of Genesis.</p>
<p>
Within the Abraham narrative the theme of seed centres on the divine assurance that Abraham will have many descendants. The initial promises that Abraham will become a great nation (Gen 12:2) and that his seed will possess the land of Canaan (Gen 12:7) are set against the background of Sarah’s inability to have children (Gen 11:30). Later, after the Lord assures Abraham that he will have a son of his own and many descendants (Gen 15:1-5), Sarah persuades him to have a child by her maidservant Hagar (Gen 16:1-4). By naming him, Abraham claims Ishmael as his own (Gen 16:15). Afterwards, however, God reveals on two separate occasions that Sarah will indeed have a son who will be Abraham’s true heir (Gen 17:15-21; 18:9-15). Eventually, Sarah gives birth to Isaac (Gen 21:1-7), and he is established as Abraham’s heir through the divinely approved departure of Hagar and Ishmael (Gen 21:8-21). Thus, Isaac’s birth marks the first step towards the fulfilment of the divine promise that Abraham will become a great nation and have numerous descendants.</p>
<p>
The second theme in the Abraham narrative concerns land. Initially, God commands Abraham to leave his own land and go to the land I will show you (Gen 12:1). Although it is not mentioned specifically that Abraham will possess this land, the promise that he will become a great nation (Gen 12:2) implies that his descendants will possess it; the Hebrew term nation denotes people inhabiting a specific geographical location and forming a political unit. Thus, when Abraham first arrives in Canaan, the Lord promises, To your offspring (seed) I will give this land (Gen 12:7). Later, following the separation of Lot from Abraham, God repeats this promise, emphasising the extent of the land to be possessed by Abraham’s descendants (Gen 13:14-17). The topic of land reappears in Gen 15:7-21 where the idea is introduced that Abraham’s descendants will only take possession of the land of Canaan after a period of four hundred years during which they will be slaves in another country (15:13-14). This revelation of a delay regarding the acquisition of the land probably explains why the promise of land, which is prominent in chapters Gen 12-15, is mentioned less frequently in the remaining chapters of the Abraham narrative (cf. Gen 17:8; 22:17). Although later episodes highlight Abraham’s acquisition of a well at Beersheba and a tomb at Hebron, these mark only the beginning of the process by which God will fulfil his promise to Abraham regarding land and nationhood.</p>
<p>
The third main strand in the Abraham narrative is the idea that Abraham and his seed will be a source of divine blessing, or possibly cursing, for others. This is highlighted in both the initial call of Abraham (Gen 12:3) and the concluding oath in Gen 22:16-18. Although various episodes reflect in part the divine blessing or cursing of others (e.g., the visit to Egypt [Gen 12:10-20], the abduction of Lot by the eastern kings [Gen 14:1-24], the rescue of Lot from Sodom [Gen 18:16-19:29], the abduction of Sarah by Abimelech [Gen 20:1-18] and the treaty between Abimelech and Abraham [Gen 21:22-34]), it is clear that, like the promise of nationhood, the promise of God’s blessing upon all the families of the earth will only be fulfilled in the future (cf. Gen 22:18).

This brief survey of the themes of seed, land and blessing establishes their presence within Gen 12-25. To explore further how they are developed within the Abraham narrative we shall examine in more detail the initial call of Abraham in Gen 12:1-3, the covenants in Gen 15 and 17, and the divine oath in Gen 22:16-18. This will enable us to have a clearer picture of how the overall narrative is structured.</p>
<h3>
The divine call of Abraham 
</h3>
<p>
Within the context of the book of Genesis the divine speech in Gen 12:1-3 is very important. It marks the beginning of a new stage in God’s relationship with humanity, and sets the agenda for the entire Abraham story, introducing those themes which will be developed in the subsequent narrative. The Lord says to Abraham,
<p>
Leave your country, your people and your father’s household and go to the land I will show you, so that I may make you into a great nation and bless you and make your name great. Be a blessing, so that I may bless those who bless you, and curse the one who disdains you, and so that all the families of the ground may be blessed through you (Gen 12:1-3; my translation).</p>
<p>
Two features of this speech are noteworthy in the present context. First, the fulfilment of the divine promises is conditional upon Abraham’s obedience. By commanding him to leave his homeland and be a blessing, God places the onus on Abraham to obey in order that the promises concerning nationhood and the blessing of others may be fulfilled. Secondly, the climax of the speech comes in the statement that through you all the families of the earth will find blessing. The primary motive behind the call of Abraham is God’s desire to bring blessing, rather than cursing, upon the families of the earth. The promise that Abraham will become a great nation, implying both numerous seed and land, must be understood as being subservient to God’s principal desire to bless all the families of the earth.</p>
<p>
Abraham’s positive response to God’s call is noted immediately, and his arrival in the land of Canaan is rewarded by the assurance that to your descendants (seed) I will give this land (Gen 12:7). The subject of land dominates Gen 13 where, following the separation of Abraham and Lot, God confirms that Abraham’s many descendants will take possession of Canaan (cf. Gen 13:14-17). The promise of land then comes to an important climax in Gen 15 with God covenanting to give Abraham’s descendants the land `from the river of Egypt to the great river, the Euphrates (Gen 15:18).</p>
<h3>
The Unconditional Promissory Covenant 
</h3>
<p>
Gen 15 falls into two parts which have in common the subject of inheritance. Whereas Gen 1-6 are concerned with Abraham’s immediate and future heirs, Gen  7-21 focus on what shall be inherited. Abraham is reassured by God:</p>
 <p>
(a) that he will have a son of his own from whom shall come numerous descendants, and </p>
<p>
(b) that after several centuries these descendants will take possession of the land of Canaan. Interestingly, the two parts of the chapter parallel each other structurally. They both begin with a divine statement (Gen 15:1; 15:7) followed by a question from Abraham (Gen 15:2: 15:8). Next we have God’s response involving an appropriate sign (Gen 15:4-5; 15:9-17), and finally, a concluding comment by the narrator (Gen 15:6; 15:18-21).</p>
<p>
Two elements in the chapter deserve special attention. First, Gen 6 contains the observation that Abram believed the Lord, and he reckoned it to him as righteousness. The rarity in Genesis of such comments by the narrator makes them all the more important when they occur. Here Abraham is viewed as righteous in God’s sight because he believes unreservedly that the Lord will fulfil his promise regarding a son and numerous descendants. Thus, Abraham is reckoned righteous on account of his faith in God’s promise, rather than due to any deeds performed by him.</p>
<p>
Secondly, the Lord makes a covenant with Abraham which affirms that his seed will possess the land of Canaan. This marks the climax of the earlier divine promises regarding land and descendants found in Gen 12:7 and Gen 13:14-17. Several features of the covenant are worth noting.</p>
<p> 
(a) It guarantees unconditionally what the Lord has stated to Abraham. Nowhere is it indicated that the fulfilment of the covenant is dependent upon the actions of either Abraham or his descendants; God covenants unreservedly to fulfil his promise that Abraham’s descendants will possess the land of Canaan. </p>
<p>
(b) The structure of the chapter suggests that there is a link between the making of the promissory covenant in verses Gen 7-21 and the comment about Abraham believing God in Gen 6. Because of the righteousness imputed to Abraham, God blesses Abraham by guaranteeing that the divine promises regarding descendants and land will be fulfilled. </p>
<p>
(c) The terms of the covenant mention only descendants and possession of the land; there is no reference to blessing being mediated to others. This omission is significant and is one of the main ways in which the Gen 15 covenant differs from that outlined in Gen 17. The covenant in Gen 15 guarantees only some of the divine promises mentioned in Gen 12:1-3. For the remainder we must look ahead to Gen 17.</p>
<h3>
The Eternal Covenant of Circumcision
</h3>
<p>
The introduction of a second covenant in Gen 17 is somewhat surprising. Why should God make another covenant with Abraham? To answer this, it is necessary to observe that the covenant in Gen 17 differs in a number of important ways from that given in Gen 15. First, it is a conditional covenant. Whereas the promissory covenant of Gen 15 is unconditional, the establishment or ratification of the covenant of circumcision is dependent upon Abraham’s continuing obedience to God. This is highlighted in the introduction to the covenant. After identifying Himself as El Shaddai (God Almighty), the Lord says to Abraham, Walk before me and be blameless so that I may establish my covenant between me and you and increase you greatly (Gen 17:1-2; my translation). Unfortunately, many English translations fail to appreciate the distinctive syntax of the Hebrew original and so miss the important link which exists between the initial imperatives, Walk before me and be blameless, and the fact that these must be obeyed before the covenant will be established. The covenant will be ratified by the Lord only if Abraham walks before God and is blameless. Significantly, for the actual establishment of the covenant we must look to the divine oath which concludes the account of the testing of Abraham in Gen 22.</p>
<p>
Secondly, the covenant of circumcision differs from the promissory covenant of Gen 15 in that it is an eternal covenant. Whereas the covenant of Gen 15 is a divine guarantee to Abraham that his descendants will possess the land of Canaan, the covenant of circumcision entails a continuing special relationship between God and Abraham’s seed. Although the covenant may embrace those who are not Abraham’s natural children - others within his household, including foreigners, may be circumcised (Gen 17:12) - God makes it clear that this covenant is intimately linked to the chosen family line; it will be established with the promised seed Isaac and not Ishmael (Gen 17:19-21).</p>
<p>
Thirdly, whereas the emphasis in Gen 15 is solely upon descendants and land, the covenant in Gen 17 focuses primarily on Abraham as the father of many nations. God states,

As for me, this is my covenant with you: You will be the father of many nations. No longer will you be called Abram; your name will be Abraham, for I have made you a father of many nations. I will make you very fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you (Gen 17:4-6).</p>
<p>
These words are echoed briefly regarding Sarah: I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her (Gen 17:16). The mention of nations coming from Abraham and Sarah presents a problem if this is interpreted as referring only to those nations which are directly descended from both of them; strictly speaking, only the Israelites and Edomites come within this category. However, it is likely that the concept of father is not restricted here to actual physical descendants. Rather Abraham is the father of all who are circumcised. Thus, God instructs Abraham to circumcise not merely his own family members but every male including those born in your household or bought with your money from a foreigner - those who are not your offspring (seed). Whether born in your household or bought with your money, they must be circumcised (Gen 17:12-13).</p>
<p>
By changing Abram’s name to Abraham, God underlines the importance of the fact that he will be the father of many nations. This occurs not because these nations are Abraham’s natural descendants but because he is for them the channel of divine blessing. This understanding of father is probably reflected in the unusual comment that Joseph was father to Pharaoh (Gen 45:8). Furthermore, when God blesses Jacob in Gen 35:11, echoing an earlier blessing by Isaac upon Jacob (Gen 28:3), a distinction is drawn between a nation and a community of nations coming from him. The implication would seem to be that whereas many nations will be closely associated with him, only one nation will be directly descended from him.</p>
<p>
In the light of the divine promises given in Gen 12:1-3 it is clear that the covenants in Gen 15 and 17 complement each other. Whereas Gen 15 focuses on descendants and land, the emphasis in Gen 17 is upon Abraham as the one who imparts God’s blessing to others; in this capacity he is the father of many nations. This understanding of the covenant of circumcision is later reflected in the divine oath of Gen 22 which establishes the covenant with Abraham.
<h3>
The Divine Oath 
</h3>
<p>
The divine speech in Gen 22:16-18 forms a frame or inclusio with Abraham’s call in Gen 12:1-3 and so brings to a conclusion the main section of the Abraham narrative. All that was promised conditionally in Gen 12:1-3 is now guaranteed by divine oath:</p>
<p>
I swear by myself, declares the LORD, that because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son, I will surely bless you and make your descendants (seed) as numerous as the stars in the sky and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants (seed) will take possession of the cities (gate) of their (his) enemies, and through your offspring (seed) all nations on earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed me (Gen 22:16-18).</p>
<p>
This oath not only signals the end of the main section of the Abraham narrative, but also establishes the covenant of circumcision promised in Gen 17. By demonstrating his obedience to God, even to the point of being willing to sacrifice his only son, Abraham fulfils the conditions laid down in 17:1; he shows beyond doubt his willingness to walk before God and be blameless.

Evidence supporting the idea that Gen 22 should be linked to the covenant of circumcision in Gen 17 may be deduced by considering the account of the covenant with Noah in chapters Gen 6-9. An analysis of this earlier covenant reveals that it has the following structure:

(a) The promise of a covenant (Gen 6:18) 
(b) The obligations of the covenant (Gen 6:14-16, 19-21; 7:1-3) 
(c) The fulfilment of the obligations (Gen 6:22; 7:5) 
(d) The sacrifice of a burnt-offering (Gen 8:20) 
(e) The establishment of the covenant (Gen 9:9-17)

Remarkably, the same structure emerges if Gen 17 and 22 are taken together. Gen 17 records the promise of a covenant with Abraham, accompanied by certain obligations: Abraham is to walk before God and be blameless. While these are more general than those given to Noah, God later tests Abraham’s obedience in a specific way; he demands that Abraham should offer up his only son Isaac as a burnt-offering (Gen 22:2). In spite of the terrible consequences of killing his heir, Abraham displays his willingness to fulfil even the most testing of divine commands. After God’s intervention and the deliverance of Isaac, Abraham offers up as a burnt-offering a ram which has been unexpectedly provided. Finally, God establishes the covenant with Abraham by swearing an oath (Gen 22:16-18).</p>
<p>
By linking Gen 17 and 22, new light may be shed on a number of issues. First, it is possible to account for the divine testing of Abraham. Through his obedience in Gen 22 Abraham demonstrates his willingness to keep the conditions of the covenant laid out in Gen 17:1. Secondly, the fact that the events of Gen 22 are part of a conditional covenant explains why Abraham is considered in Gen 22:16-18 and Gen 26:2-5 to have merited by his obedience the divine guarantee of the promises concerning seed, land and the blessing of others. Thirdly, the oath in Gen 22:16-18 forms a most fitting conclusion to the main section of the Abraham narrative. Although many scholars view Gen 15-18 as a later addition to the original account of the testing of Abraham, the structure of the covenant requires the sacrifice of a burnt-offering before God could confirm with an oath the earlier promises. Gen 15-18 are not only an integral and essential part of Gen 22 but of the entire Abraham narrative.

The divine oath in Gen 22:16-18 not only embraces the contents of the earlier promissory covenant regarding many descendants and land but also includes the additional aspect that all nations will be blessed through Abraham’s seed. The mention of seed is significant. Unfortunately, the identify of this seed is not easy to determine. While the first mention of seed denotes descendants in the plural, the remaining references are ambiguous; they could refer either to many descendants or to a single descendant. </p>
<p>
This latter possibility deserves special consideration for three reasons. 
First, the book of Genesis as a whole devotes considerable attention to tracing a line of seed which, beginning with Adam and ending with Judah, forms the early ancestry of the David dynasty. Unfortunately, the importance of this single line of descendants is generally overlooked by scholars. 
Secondly, the Jacob and Joseph stories give prominence to the blessing which the patriarchs, as members of this family line, may bestow on others. Although Esau and Jacob are both the seed of Isaac, it is clear that the brother who receives the father’s blessing will be favoured more than the other. Thus it is Jacob who experiences God’s blessing and is able to mediate it to others. Similarly, Joseph is undoubtedly favoured by his father Jacob who eventually imparts the blessing of the first born to Joseph’s son Ephraim (Gen 48:1-22). Significantly, Genesis focuses on the blessing which others receive through Jacob and Joseph. They alone are presented as the ones who may impart blessing to others. Although other seed exist, the Genesis narrative associates the power to bless with those who receive the first-born blessing. Thirdly, in announcing the covenant of circumcision to Abraham, God emphasises the unique role of Isaac; it is with Isaac that the covenant will be established and not with Ishmael (Gen 17:19,21). Given the limited interest which Genesis displays in the descendants of Ishmael, it seems logical to conclude that the seed of Abraham mentioned in Gen 22:18 does not include Ishmael and his descendants. For these reasons, the possibility exists that the final reference to seed in Gen 22:18 denotes a single descendant.</p>
<p>
Clearly, the covenants in Gen 15 and 17 differ markedly. Whereas Gen 15 records an unconditional promissory covenant which does not necessarily entail an ongoing relationship between God and the descendants of Abraham, the covenant of circumcision is both conditional and eternal. Furthermore, while it is implied in Gen 15 that Abraham’s faith, credited as righteousness, is the catalyst for the making of the promissory covenant, the establishment of the covenant of circumcision rests on Abraham’s obedience to God. As reflected in Gen 26:2-5, Abraham’s obedience is an important factor in the establishment of this eternal covenant.</p>
<p>
Viewed as a whole, the Abraham narrative provides an interesting picture of the interplay between divine word and human faith and obedience. Initially, the Lord makes a series of promises, the fulfilment of which is conditional upon Abraham’s obedience (Gen 12:1-3). As Abraham in faith obeys and journeys to Canaan, God declares that he shall have both land and descendants (Gen 12:7; 13:14-17). In time these statements are confirmed in a promissory covenant (Gen 15:18-21) which is linked to Abraham being credited as righteous on account of his faith (Gen 15:6). The narrative, however, does not conclude here, but goes on to highlight Abraham’s continuing faith in and obedience to God, as revealed in the establishment of the eternal covenant of circumcision (Gen 17:1-27; 22:1-19), a covenant which focuses on the divine blessing that will come through Abraham and his seed to all nations. Thus, from beginning to end, faith, expressed in obedience, is the hallmark of Abraham’s relationship with the Lord.</p>
<p>
Abraham’s faith, however, is all the more remarkable when the following factors are also taken into account. Firstly, it is clear that the divine promises concerning nationhood (i.e., seed and land) and the blessing of all the families of the earth will never be fulfilled in Abraham’s lifetime; at the very most Abraham will only experience the first fruits of their fulfilment. Secondly, circumstances exist or develop which mitigate against the fulfilment of these promises. Sarah’s barrenness is a major obstacle for much of the narrative, and even when all seems assured with the birth of Isaac, God himself places the future fulfilment of the promises in jeopardy by demanding that Abraham sacrifice Isaac. Yet, in spite of these factors Abraham displays a faith in God which in the book of Genesis is matched only by that of Noah.</p>
