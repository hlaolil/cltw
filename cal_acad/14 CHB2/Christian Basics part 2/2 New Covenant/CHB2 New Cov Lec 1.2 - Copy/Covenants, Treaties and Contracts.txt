Covenants, Treaties and Contracts 
</h1>
<p>
Modern man thinks nothing of it to enter into a contract -- be it for some real estate or a business transaction -- by simply signing a piece of paper. But ancient man did not have it so easy. The contracts and treaties of today are the result of thousands of years of social development, and the forms we use today are derivatives of totally different forms used in ancient days.

We know that the Bible is the source for every human and divine manifestation.  However, it is not generally realised that the Bible is also a history or reference book for institutions that regulate treaties, covenants and contracts. I have researched the whole of the Bible for indications of such institutions and have found many. Here I wish to survey a few of the main forms found in the Bible, so that future students can build on these findings.</p>
<h3>
Functions of Covenants, Treaties and Contracts
</h3>
<p>
The main purpose of an agreement between two parties -- whether between God and His people, between an individual and a foreign king, between two nations, or between two individuals -- is to act out the transaction between the two parties that their agreement achieves. There is also a need to make the parties enforce their obligation. And, finally, it is necessary to make the agreement, and the memory of it having taken place, last as long as possible.</p>
<h3>
Eating and Drinking as Contract Form
</h3>
<p>
The most basic concept of a reciprocal agreement is to make both parties join in a personal bond that they physically act out. If both partake in a meal -- where they both eat and drink from the same dishes -- the body of one of them actually absorbs the body of something that the body of the other party has also consumed. This ties them together insolubly. A clear example of this is the sale by Esau of his first born right to Jacob. While on the face of it, the deal was struck when Jacob handed Esau a dish of lentil soup, that was not what gave the deal contractual validity. That was accomplished through a common meal:</p> 
<p><font color= "blue">
"And Jacob gave Esau bread and stew of lentils; then he ate and drank" (Gen 25:34)</font>. </p>
<p>
Perhaps Esau was not aware of the binding character of this common meal, because later -- Gen 27:36 -- he says that Jacob "took" or stole the first born right.
The amazing aspect of this form of a contract is that it was also used to seal a covenant between God and His people: The most sublime phase of the relationship between God and the Jewish people is described in Exodus, after the "Book of the Covenant" has handed by Moses to the nation's leaders, who were allowed to ascend the mountain. There, finally, the Covenant was sealed -- with food and drink: <font color= "blue">"But on the nobles of the children of Israel He did not lay His hand. So they saw God, and they ate and drank." (Ex 24:11)</font>. Surely, at that most exalted moment that a human being can reach, Moses and the elders did not have an urge to still their hunger and their thirst. It was clearly a format for the "contractual" relationship that had just been concluded.</p>
<p>
The same practice is found in a political encounter between the Jews and the Gibeonites. This tribe, with impunity, feigned a desire that -- as strangers from a far-off land -- they had come to enter into a covenant with the Jews and therefore had brought bread and wine, in order to close a personal peace treaty: <font color= "blue">"This our bread we took … these bottles of wine … And Joshua made peace with them and made a covenant with them" (Joshua 9:12-15)</font>. Although the ruse was soon discovered, Joshua honoured the peace treaty he had been "conned" into, since it was sealed with a common meal!</p>
<p>
A political manoeuvre involving eating and drinking is reported in the Book of Judges: <font color= "blue">"Now Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers and went over to Shechem; and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him." (Judges 9:26)</font>. This eating and drinking sealed a conspiracy against Abimelech, which ended badly.</p>
<h3>
Sacrificing of Animals
</h3>
<p>
I stated above that there was an urgent need to give a treaty truly binding force. The mechanism used to accomplish this was to include in an agreement a blessing for him who would fulfil his obligation under the treaty and a curse for him who would violate it. In several political treaties between ancient kingdoms preserved on cuneiform tables, there is often listed a number of animals that were ceremoniously slaughtered at the time of the signing of the treaty. The accompanying words were a curse to the effect that anyone violating the treaty would die like these animals, just slaughtered, died. In some cases the number of animals involved was seven.</p>
<p>
A close parallel to this practice is found in the treaty between Abraham and Abimelech, the king of the Philistines. Here we find <font color= "blue">"Abraham set aside, by themselves, seven female lambs from the flock." (Gen 21:28)</font>. While it is not spelled out, it is very likely that these seven lambs were slaughtered in a significant and legally binding curse ceremony to fortify the treaty between the two. In fact, I have found that the word for "swearing an oath" in Hebrew reflects this very ceremony. ("to swear") means, literally, "to take upon oneself the fate of the seven." This definition seems a very strange formulation of the word unless we recognise that it originally referred to the seven animals that were ceremoniously slaughtered by Abraham as a warning to anyone violating his oath. After the ceremony of the seven lambs, the Bible tells us <font color= "blue">"they drew up a treaty at Beersheba" (Gen 21:32)</font>. </p>
<p>
Isaac also went to Beersheba for the conclusion of the peace agreement with Abimelech. While there is no reference to the seven animals, there is mention of a common meal: <font color= "blue">"And he (Isaac) made them a feast (Abimelech and his Egyptian chief of staff, Phichol), and they ate and they drank" (Gen 26:30)</font>.</p>
<h3>
Cutting Up of an Animal or Person
</h3>
<p>
A variation on the killing of seven animals to strengthen the compliance with a treaty is the covenant concluded through the cutting up of animals. In Gen 15:9- 10, the covenant between God and Abraham is confirmed through a ceremony in which a heifer, a goat, a ram and a turtle dove were cut in half -- possibly the strongest accepted ceremony for establishing a covenant. An echo of this ceremony is found when Jeremiah speaks of <font color= "blue">the princes of Judah, the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf—" (Jer 34:19)</font>.</p>
<p>
A knife or sharp instrument can used to make an incision in either the palms or the wrists of each participant. This was to allow blood to freely flow. The Bible teaches that life is in the blood. The two participants then engage in a handshake allowing the free flowing blood to intermingle. Nowadays with so many blood borne diseases this practise could be very risky.</p>
<h3>
Passing a Garment
</h3>
<p>
An interesting form of invoking or breaking a covenant is found in a few places by the ceremony of tearing off a piece of a person's garment and passing it on to the other contracting party. <font color= "blue">And as Samuel turned around to go away, Saul seized the edge of his robe, and it tore, (1 Samuel 15:27)</font> demonstrating that God's covenant with Saul was abrogated. Something similar happened to Solomon. The prophet <font color= "blue">Ahijah took hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it into twelve pieces. And he said to Jeroboam, “Take for yourself ten pieces, for thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: ‘Behold, I will tear the kingdom out of the hand of Solomon and will give ten tribes to you (1 Kings 11:30-32)</font> it was the confirmation of a covenant concluded with Jeroboam.</p>
<p>
This ceremony resembles, of course, the act of Boaz: <font color= "blue">"Now this was the custom in former times in Israel concerning redeeming and exchanging, to confirm anything: one man took off his sandal and gave it to the other, and this was a confirmation in Israel." (Ruth 4:7)</font>.</p>
<p>
Since a shoe is a symbol of power and control, taking away a shoe means taking away someone's title to land or other property. The act of taking off a shoe is of course also found in the case of the brother-in-law who refuses to marry the widow of his brother: <font color= "blue">"then his brother’s wife shall come to him in the presence of the elders, remove his sandal from his foot, ..." (Deut 25:9)</font>. </p>
<p>
The ceremony dramatises the loss of rights by the surviving brother to his dead brother's wife.</p>
<h3>
Final Form of Commercial Contract
</h3>
<p>
Until now, we have dealt with dramatic, symbolic ceremonies that "acted out" the entering into a covenant or contract, or abrogation thereof. But with commercial and land transaction increasing, Jews adopted more practical, every-day procedures. Jer 32, gives us a detailed report on a land transaction shortly before the fall of Jerusalem in 587 BCE. Jeremiah buys land in his native town of Anatot, by producing two contracts, one on top of the other: "Take these contracts, namely of the sealed one and the open one" (Jer 32:14). In the days when clay tablets were used for written texts, one copy of the contract would be written and sealed, and then a case would be placed upon it, on the outside of which the same contract would be written again. The purpose of these "case contracts" was to avoid forgeries. In case of disputes, the judge would break open the outside "case contract" and compare it with the sealed up text on the inside text. The concern to perpetuate the memory and validity of the contract is expressed in Jer 32:14, where the prophet orders the contracts placed in "an earthen vessel that they may be preserved for many days."</p>
<p>
This procedure was modified some centuries later, when, instead of clay tablets, Jews would write their contracts on papyrus or parchment. Still the outside and the inside texts of the same contract had to be produced. </p>
