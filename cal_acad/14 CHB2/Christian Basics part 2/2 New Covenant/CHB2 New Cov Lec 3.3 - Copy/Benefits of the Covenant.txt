Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathise with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need. (Heb 4:14-16)</font></p>
<p>
When you are faced with trials of life or if are wondering if you will ever go to heaven when you die you better make a choice. The choice is to approach Jesus. Not just approach but do so in confidence. This is because He is the high priest of our confession.</p>
<p>
Jesus too faced the temptations that we all face. No was no stranger to it. He understands how people face attacks on their faith whether it is direct threats or lies of the enemy. But in all this remember that Jesus was tempted like us but never succumbed to it. He overcame sin, death and the grave.</p>

The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labour is not in vain in the Lord. (1 Cor 15: 56-58)</font></p>

No wonder in the light of the Holy Scriptures when you are beset with temptations or just situations which try to rob you of true faith, approach Jesus confidently. The Lord Jesus came for sinners. He is ever willing to help those who want to leave sin and come to His throne of grace. He will forgive those who come back to Him. In fact if you are faced with temptation you donâ€™t actually have to sin. Pray to Christ, yes pray to Him to help you overcome temptation. He is mighty to save and deliver, if only you trust and pray to Him.</p>
