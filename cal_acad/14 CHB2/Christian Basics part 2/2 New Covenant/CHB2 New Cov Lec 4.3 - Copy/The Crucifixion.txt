<h1>
The Crucifixion
</h1>
<h3>
Jesus Mocked and Scourged
</h3>
<p>
According to Matthew and Mark, Jesus was taken by the soldiers into the common hall, which was thronged with Roman soldiers. There, they stripped Him and mocked Him by putting on Him a purple robe and a crown of thorns. The indignities included being spat upon and being repeatedly beaten on the head. A parallel account is given in Mark 15:16-20, but Luke says only that Pilate delivered Jesus <font color= "blue">“to their will” (Luke 23:25)</font>. The fullest account is found in John 19:1-16, where the actual order of events which took place is given.</p>
<p>
Putting the accounts together, it seems that Pilate himself observed and supervised this abuse of Jesus. His motivation was to degrade Him and to make His claim as a King of the Jews to be ridiculous. It is probable that Pilate hoped by this means to get off without actually having to order the crucifixion of Jesus. While Matthew introduces this idea of crucifixion in Matt 27:26, John 19:16 makes clear that the order for crucifixion came at the end of the mockery rather than at the beginning. Matthew is simply recording the facts without necessarily giving the order of events.</p>
<p>
That Jesus was submissive to this entire procedure is the measure of His total submission to the will of God. Here, the Lord of glory, capable of destroying anyone who put a hand upon Him, allowed Himself to be abused in this painful and humiliating way. Although the Scriptures are graphic, even they state only the essentials. The prophet Isaiah anticipated this when he stated, <font color= "blue">“His visage was marred more than any man, and His form more than the sons of men.” (Isa 52:14)</font> Jesus was beaten about the head and the body until He was almost unrecognisable.</p>
<p>
Few incidents in history more clearly illustrate the brutality in the desperately wicked heart of man than that which was inflicted on Jesus the Son of God. The mockery of the crown of thorns, painful as well as humiliating, His being stripped naked in front of the large crowd; the mockery of the purple robe, intended to represent a kingly garment; His being spit upon and beaten over the head repeatedly as well as the mocking worship testified to the unbelief and sordidness of the actors in this situation. It was only after enduring all of this in complete silence, except for the conversation between Christ and Pilate recorded in John 19:8-11, that Jesus was finally led away to the crucifixion.</p>
<p>
As the custom was, the accused had to bear His own cross. Luke 23:26-32 records some of the incidents that occurred on the way to Golgotha. Because of Christ’s suffering, He was too weak to carry the cross Himself; and Simon of Cyrene, who is identified in Mark 15:21 as the father of Alexander and Rufus, was forced to carry the cross for Jesus. The hour had come for the Lamb of God to die for the sins of the whole world.</p>
<h3>
Jesus Crucified
</h3>
The account of Matthew and the parallel accounts in the other gospels (Matt 27: 33-50;Mark 15:22-32; Luke 23:33-43; John 19:17-24) need to be combined to give the full account of the incidents that occurred at the crucifixion leading up to His death. The order of events seems to be as follows:</p>
<p>
1. The arrival at Golgotha (Matt 27:33; Mark 15:22; Luke 23:33; John 19:17)</p>
<p>
2. The offer of the wine mingled with gall (Matt 27:34; Mark 15:23)</p>
<p>
3. The act of crucifixion between the two thieves (Matt 27:35-38; Mark 15:24-28; Luke 23:33-38; 19:18)</p>
<p>
4. The first cry from the cross, “Father, forgive them ...” (Luke 23:34)</p>
<p>
5. The soldiers taking the garments of Jesus, leaving Him naked on the cross (Matt 27:35; Mark 15:24; Luke 23:34; John 19:23)</p>
<p>
6. The Jews mocking Jesus (Matt 27:39-43; Mark 15:29-32; Luke 23:35-37)</p>
<p>
7. The conversation with the thieves (Matt 27:44; Mark 15:32; Luke 23:39-43)<p>
<p>
8. The second cry from the cross with the words, <font color= "blue">“Today you will be with Me in Paradise” (Luke 23:43)</font></p>
<p>
9. The third cry, <font color= "blue">“Woman, behold thy son!” (John 19:26-27)</font></p>
<p>
10. The darkness which overtook the scene on Calvary (Matt 27:45; Mark 15:33; Luke 23:44)</p>
<p>
11. The fourth cry, beginning, <font color= "blue">“My God, My God ...” (Matt 27:46-47; Mark 15:34-36)</font></p>
<p>
12. The fifth cry, <font color= "blue">“I thirst” (John 19:28)</font></p>
<p>
13. The sixth cry, <font color= "blue">“It is finished!” (John 19:30)</font></p>
<p>
14. The seventh cry, <font color= "blue">“Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit” (Luke 23:46)</font></p>
<p>
15. The Lord dismissing His spirit by an act of His own will (Matt 27:50; Mark 15:37; Luke 23:46; John 19:30)</p>
<p>
Matthew notes that Golgotha is “a place of a skull,” which is what Golgotha means, apparently from the idea that the hill Calvary looked something like a human skull. The hill above the garden tomb discovered by Gordon has a skull-like appearance from the side. The top of the hill is now a Muslim cemetery, and there is a convenient tomb which is identified as the tomb of Jesus at the foot of the hill in the garden. Positive identification of this site, of course, is impossible today.</p>
<p>
Matthew records Christ’s refusal to drink the sour wine mingled with a drug, which would have tended to dull His senses and make the cross easier to bear. Matthew simply records His crucifixion without going into details, as the crude spikes were driven through His hands and His feet, and the entire cross was set up by being placed in a hole in the ground.</p>
<p>
The soldiers took His garments, tearing them in four pieces so that each soldier could have a part, but they cast lots for the coat, which was a woven garment, as John 19:23-24 explains. Matthew regards this as a fulfilment of the prophecy of Psa 22:18. Textual evidence seems to indicate that this was added to Matthew’s gospel, but that in John 19:24, it is properly included. In any case, the prophecy was fulfilled.</p>
<p>
The event of His crucifixion, as stated in Mark 15:25, reckoned according to Jewish time, was the third hour, or 9:00 a.m., or, as mentioned in John 19:14, the sixth hour, according to Roman time, actually meaning after 6:00 a.m., or early in the morning.</p>
<p>
According to John 19:19, Pilate himself had ordered that the accusation made against Jesus should be nailed to His cross; and Matthew records this as,<font color= "blue"> “THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS” (Matt 27:37)</font>. The wording in each gospel varies, and the title itself was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin (John 19:20). Putting the accounts together, the full inscription was, “This is Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.” All the accounts contain the phrase, “The King of the Jews,” which was the substance of the accusation. Pilate intended this as a rebuke to the Jews, but at the same time it was a testimony to the person of Christ.</p>
<p>
Mention is also made of the two thieves who were crucified on either side of Jesus. Only Luke 23:39-43 describes the conversion of one of the thieves. Matthew records the mocking of the crowd and the chief priests and scribes and elders, as they challenged Christ to come down from the cross, if He were indeed the Son of God who had said that He could destroy the temple and build it in three days.</p>
<p>
How tragically true it was, as recorded, <font color= "blue">“He saved others; Himself He cannot save.” (Matt 27:42)</font> It was not that He lacked power; it was because it was the will of the Father that He should die. The mockery accurately fulfilled the anticipation of Psa 22:6-13.</p>
<p>
Tasker notes there were three classes of mockers:</p>
<p>
(1) “Ignorant sinners”; </p>
<p>
(2) “religious sinners”; </p>
<p>
(3) “condemned sinners.” </p>
<p>
The tragedy was not that He was dying on the cross, but that the people beheld Him in hardness of heart and wickedness of unbelief.</p>
<h3>
Jesus Dies on the Cross
</h3>
<p>
The closing events of the life of Jesus as He died on the cross are recorded in all gospels (Matt 27:45-54; Mark 15:33-41; Luke 23:44-49; John 19:30-37). Matthew records that from the sixth hour, or noon in Jewish reckoning, there was darkness over the land until the ninth hour, or 3:00 p.m. This darkness seems to have begun after the third cry of Christ on the cross in which He put His mother, Mary, under the care of John (John 19:26-27). It was in this period of darkness that Jesus became the sin offering and, as such, was forsaken by God the Father. Matthew records the fourth cry of Jesus: <font color= "blue">"And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?” that is, “My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?” (Matt 27:46)</font>.</p>
<p>
Matthew’s account uses the Hebrew for “My God,” eli, but “lama sabachthani?” is Aramaic, the spoken language of the Jews. Mark changes the Hebrew eli to eloi, which is Aramaic. The petition of Jesus is, of course, the quotation of Psa 22:1, although the gospels do not mention it as a fulfilment.</p>
<p>
The cry of Jesus has been variously interpreted, but it seems clear that God had judicially forsaken Jesus on the cross in contrast to the fact that He had strengthened Him in the garden of Gethsemane. Here Jesus was bearing the sins of the whole world, and even God the Father had to turn away as Jesus bore the curse and identified Himself with the sins of the whole world. When Jesus actually died, He commended Himself back into the Father’s hands.</p>
<p>
Those who heard Jesus utter this cry mistook the word eli for Elias, and thought that He was calling for Elijah. Matthew records that one of them took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, and put it on a reed, in order to bring it to the lips of Jesus, to enable Him to speak more clearly. The rest of the observers, however, said that he should let Jesus alone to see whether Elijah actually came to save Him.</p> 
<p>
While they observed, according to Matthew,<font color= "blue"> “Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit.” (Matt 27:50)</font>.</p> 
<p>
Luke records that Jesus said: “Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit.” (Luke 23:46)</p> 
<p>
John records simply that Jesus said, “It is finished” (John 19:30).</p> 
<p>
Jesus had lived as no man has ever lived, and He died as no man ever died. Having completed His act of sacrifice, He dismissed His spirit by an act of His will. As He had stated earlier, in regard to His life, <font color= "blue">“No one takes it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.” (John 10:18)</font></p>
<p>
At the moment of His death, a number of awesome things took place. An earthquake occurred, and the heaving ground brought fear to those who observed. According to Matt 27:51, the heavy veil of the temple, which separated the holy of holies from the holy place, was torn in two from the top to the bottom. As the divine commentary in Heb 10:19-22 signifies, the death of Jesus opened the way for ordinary believers to go into the holy of holies, where formerly only the Jewish high priests could go.</p>
<p>
Although not immediately known to those who witnessed the scene of Christ’s death, Matthew also records an event not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible:<font color= "blue"> “And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised;  and coming out of the graves after His resurrection, they went into the holy city, and appeared to many” (Matt 27:52-53)</font>. As a careful reading of this account reveals, the raising of the bodies of the saints, although mentioned here, actually occurred after the resurrection of Jesus. This event is nowhere explained in the Scriptures but seems to be a fulfilment of the feast of the first fruits of harvest mentioned in Lev 23:10-14. On that occasion, as a token of the coming harvest, the people would bring a handful of grain to the priest. The resurrection of these saints, occurring after Jesus Himself was raised, is a token of the coming harvest when all the saints will be raised.</p>
<p>
The centurion, impressed by the darkness and the earthquake, although he probably was not informed of the tearing of the veil of the temple, according to the Scriptures, feared greatly, saying, <font color= "blue">“Truly this was the Son of God” (Matt 27:54)</font>. Although he had witnessed many executions, there never before had been one like this.</p>
<p>
Matthew comments that many of the women who had followed Christ were beholding this from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee’s children. No doubt, with the coming of evening and the knowledge that Christ had died, they went sorrowfully to their homes.</p>
<h3>
Burial of Jesus
</h3>
<p>
Ordinarily, there was little ceremony in connection with those crucified, and their bodies would be thrown into a shallow grave or even on a refuse heap. The problem of what to do with the body of Christ was quickly solved, however, by the intervention of Joseph of Arimathaea. The account given in all four gospels (Matt 27:57-61; Mark 15:42-47; Luke 23:50-56; John 19:38-42) indicates that he was a wealthy and influential man, a member of the Sanhedrin (Luke 23:51), and one who had been secretly a disciple of Jesus (John 19:38). He went boldly in to Pilate, although this involved ceremonial defilement for a Jew during the feast, and requested the body of Jesus. Mark 15:44-45 records Pilate’s surprise that Jesus was already dead, his inquiry from the centurion to verify the fact, and his permission to Joseph.</p>
<p>
Matthew and the other gospels record the details of His burial. In the custom of the Jews, He was wrapped in clean linen cloth, and His body was placed in a new tomb hewn out of the rock. The stone door was rolled before the opening of the tomb, as they completed the act of burial. Matthew records that the two women, Mary Magdalene and “the other Mary,” identified in Mark 15:47 as “mother of Joses,” watched the burial. John 19:39-40 adds that Nicodemus, who first encountered Jesus in the incident recorded in John 3, participated in the burial, bringing myrrh and aloes of about one hundred pounds, the spices being used to saturate the linen cloths in which the body of Jesus was bound. John also records that the place of burial was in a garden.</p>
<p>
The entire burial operation was done with some haste, because the Sabbath, which began at sundown, was already beginning (Mark 15:42; Luke 23:54; John 19:42). The Sabbath following the Passover had a special meaning, leading as it did to the seven-day Feast of Unleavened Bread.</p>
<h3>
Sealing of the Tomb 
</h3>
<p>
Only Matt 27:62-66 records the incident of the chief priests and Pharisees coming to Pilate the next day, which was Saturday, and requesting that the tomb be sealed to keep the disciples from stealing the body of Jesus and then claiming that He was risen from the dead. It is most interesting that the chief priests and Pharisees, who were unbelievers, remembered the prediction of Jesus that He would rise again after three days, while this truth does not seem to have penetrated the consciousness of the disciples in their sorrow. With Pilate’s permission, the Jews sealed the stone, which had closed the tomb’s door, and set a watch of soldiers to be sure there was no interference with the tomb.</p>
<p>
The temple soldiers were not used for this purpose, as their jurisdiction was only the temple area. A regular detachment of Roman soldiers was sent to watch the tomb. Pilate had said to them,<font color= "blue"> “make it as secure as you know how” (Matt 27:65)</font> and so they did. Stealing the body of Jesus was an impossibility, but chief priests, and Pharisees, and all the power of the Roman government could not prevent Jesus rising from the grave. Their care in thus guarding the tomb only added to the certainty of the evidence when the resurrection took place.</p>
