The Institution of the New Covenant Meal.</font></p>
<p>
According to Luke 22, the new covenant meal was instituted during the last Passover supper shared with his disciples. Luke directly links the old covenant Passover with the new covenant meal. Jesus ate this Passover with the anticipation that he would eat it (the Passover) again with the disciples in the kingdom of God. The Passover supper would find its "fulfilment in the kingdom of God" (Luke 22:16) where they would eat and drink at Jesus' table in his kingdom (Luke 22:30). Luke places this new covenant meal on the trajectory of redemptive history where the goal is the eschatological community of God in the heavenly kingdom. Jesus will eat and drink with the disciples again when the kingdom comes (Luke 22:18). The fullness of kingdom is the reign of God in the eschaton (a day at the end of time following Armageddon when God will decree the fates of all individual humans according to the good and evil of their earthly lives) (cf. parable in Luke 19:11-27).</p> 
<p>
However, Luke also believed that in the person of Jesus, who exorcised demons, the kingdom was already present (Luke 11:20), and that Pentecost was the inauguration of restored Israel when Jesus' ascent to the throne of David was proclaimed (Acts 1:6; 2:29-35 with Luke 1:30-33). Thus, the fulfilment of which Jesus speaks in Luke 22 has a dual import: it is fulfilment in the new covenant meal of the inaugurated kingdom (the church) as well as the eschatological banquet. When the church eats this meal, it eats the new covenant Passover (or thanksgiving meal) and it does so with the expectation of eschatological victory. It eats in the light of the resurrected Lord who has conquered death and will remove the disgrace of his people. The supper is a meal shared with the risen Lord.</p>
<p>
This eschatological victory is won on the ground of the blood of the new covenant and the sacrificial offering of the body of Christ. The expiatory work of the body and blood of Jesus removes sin and enables the establishment of a covenant meal. Luke's language reflects the influence of both Ex 24 (covenant in blood) and Jer 31 (new covenant). This language, in connection with the Passover context, establishes the covenantal character of this meal. There is a strong continuity with the old covenant meals, but there is also a redemptive-historical fulfilment of the old in the new covenant. The type has been fulfilled and taken to a new level, but that fulfilment in the Lord's Supper anticipates an eschatological fulfilment when the kingdom of God fully arrives.</p>
<p>
The words of institution emphasise that this covenant meal is focused on remembering the work of God in Christ. Just like the Passover, the new covenant meal is a memorial of God's work in redemptive history. While the Passover remembered the Exodus, the new covenant meal remembers the gospel events, the death and resurrection of Jesus. As a gospel meal, it makes real the work of God for the community. The saving work of God is not simply a past memory, but a present reality through the covenant meal. It makes us realise the reality of God's salvation for us now, just as the annual Passover has brought to life the Exodus for Israel throughout its history (cf. Deut 16:1-8). </p>

The Communion of the New Covenant Meal</font></p>
<p>
In 1 Cor 10 Paul uses the covenantal character of the Lord's Supper to counter the problem of arrogant idolatry among the Corinthians. The "spiritual" of Corinth thought themselves inviolate because of their participation in the spiritual reality of Christ. Paul reminds them of the history of Israel who fell even though they themselves had eaten and drunk from the same spiritual resource--Christ (1 Cor 10:4). Fellowship with Christ in eating and drinking does not entail a guarantee of relationship regardless of lifestyle (1 Cor 10:6-10). Whoever arrogantly thinks he stands is in danger of falling (1 Cor 10:12).

Communion with Christ, participation in the spiritual reality of God, involves covenantal responsibility. Whoever eats the sacrifice participates or communes in the altar (1 Cor. 10:18). To eat the sacrifice is a matter of covenantal commitment. One cannot eat from the table of the Lord (cf. Mal. 1:12) and from the table of demons (idolatry). To do both would provoke the covenant Lord to jealousy for his covenant people (1 Cor. 10:21-22). To eat from the Lord's table means to be committed to the Lord's covenant. To drink the Lord's cup is to renew our covenant with God through Christ. Just as the fellowship offering appeared again and again at key redemptive-historical moments as covenant renewal, so every Lord's day is a covenant renewal for the covenant people through the Lord's Supper.

The communion of the altar in the new covenant meal is a communion with the body and blood of Christ as well as the communion of the many members as one body. The covenant meal means to share in the blessings of God's work in Christ, and the meal means that we come before him as the one covenant people of God. Our communion is a participation in the one spiritual reality which was created by the offering of the body and blood of Christ. As the body of Christ, we share that reality with each other--there is only one body. Though there are many members, there is one body of fellowship which is focused on Christ's work rather than the ministry of its diverse members (cf. 1 Cor. 1:13; 3:5,21-23). The covenant meal is a communal meal where the people of God are united to each other by their covenant with the one God.
<h3>
The Covenantal Meaning of the Lord's Supper
</h3>
<p>
One of the most fruitful ways of revitalising the experience of the Lord's Supper in our fellowship today is through an understanding of its covenantal meaning. Toward that end, I offer this summary drawn from the redemptive-historical character of the meal as well as the above Lukan and Pauline texts.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Covenantal Memory</font></p>
<p> 
When we remember Christ in the Lord's Supper, we remember the covenant God has made with his people. The spiritual reality of this covenant is actualized for us through our remembering. It moves from a past memory to a present experience of the reality of God's grace. The bread and wine actualize the reality of salvation for us in the worship experience. There is a genuine experience of salvation when we eat and drink by faith. To remember God's work in Christ is to experience the reality of our covenantal fellowship with God. The spiritual reality of God's salvation is present through our remembering in the covenant meal. The Lord's Supper, then, is a moment of grace when we receive it by faith through our memory of God's work for us.
Covenantal Renewal. When we eat and drink we renew our covenant with God. We pledge ourselves to keep the covenant. Just as Israel voiced its willingness to obey the covenant, so we ratify the covenant in our life when we eat and drink. It is a moment of rededication and re-commitment. In the context of the worship experience, we voice our commitment to live worthy of the gospel (cf. Phil 1:27). We vow to take up our cross, call upon Jesus as Lord and follow him into the world as an obedient servant. The Supper is the ritual moment when we renew the covenant vow we made in our baptism.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Covenantal Presence</font></p>
<p> 
God has always promised to live among his people and to be their God (cf. Gen 17:7-8; Lev 26:11-12; Jer 11:4; 24:7). God is present among his people in the covenant meal--it is an eating and drinking in the presence of the covenant Lord (Ex 18:12; Deut 12:7,18; 14:23-26; 15:20; 1 Chron 29:22). The presence of God in the meal, in the tabernacle, in the temple is a covenantal presence. This presence is found in the church through the indwelling Spirit by whom we are the temple of God (1 Cor 3:16; 6:19; 2 Cor. 6:16), and by whom the Living Lord is present through faith (Eph 3:16,17). The church is the habitation of God through the Spirit (Eph 2:22). In the covenant meal, the body and blood of Christ are present through the Spirit who lifts us up to feed on Christ and share the spiritual reality rooted in Christ. As we worship in the Spirit (Phil 3:3), Christ is present through the covenant meal.</p>

Covenantal Fellowship</font></p>
<p>
The covenant meal symbolises and mediates the fellowship between God and his covenant people. It testifies to the reconciliation which God has enacted and the peace which exists between God and the redeemed, and between the redeemed. It is a moment of joy, communion and thanksgiving. The people of God celebrate their reconciliation by God's work; they rejoice in the redemptive work of God for them. The covenant meal is a Eucharist, a thanksgiving, which assures the worshipper of God's love and redemptive work. As surely as one eats and drinks through faith, so also one certainly participates in God's salvation and participates in the community of God. The Lord's Supper is not something to be avoided in times of doubt and uncertainty; it is a gracious gift to be received by faith where doubt and uncertainty can be eradicated by the testimony of God's covenant in the meal. It is a testament of his love. It is a moment of communal fellowship between God and his community. It is a moment of communion with the risen Lord at whose table we eat and drink.</p>

Covenantal Promise</font></p>
<p> 
The new covenant meal is one of hope and expectation. We live in the light of God's revelation of the end of history--He showed us what the end of history is through the resurrection of Jesus. The Lord's Supper, then, is a celebration of God's victory over death through Jesus. It is not a funeral, but a celebratory affirmation of hope in a tragic, fallen world. Through the covenant meal we proclaim our faith in God's eschatological promises, and we anticipate the messianic banquet in God's eschatological kingdom. As we eat and drink now, we eat and drink in the hope of eating and drinking with Jesus in the fullness of His kingdom.</p>
