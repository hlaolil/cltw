<h1>
Jesus and the New Covenant
</h1>
<p>
At the Last Supper, Jesus proclaimed that the wine-cup represented His own blood, which would be the blood of the new covenant (Matt 26:28; Mark 14:24; Heb 10:29). The cup represented the <font color= "blue">“new covenant in My blood” (Luke 22:20; 1 Cor 11:25)</font>. Just as the Sinaitic covenant was sealed with blood, so also the new covenant was ratified when Jesus’ blood was poured out on the cross. We renew that covenant and reaffirm our commitment to it when we drink the wine and eat the bread, remembering the Lord’s death until He returns. The Lord’s Supper is a visible and tangible reminder of the covenant. But the wine is not sprinkled on the surface of the people — it is swallowed. The new covenant affects our innermost being.</p>
<p>
The New Covenant is superior to the old, for it has been founded on better promises (Heb 8:6). The old covenant could never make anyone perfect; no one could meet its righteous demands. It has now become “obsolete” (Heb 8:13); its laws are “set aside”5 (Heb 7:18; 10:9) — replaced by a better hope, better promises and an effective transformation of the heart, a transformation that begins with faith.</p>
<p>
Jesus Christ is the Messenger and Mediator of the New Covenant (Heb 8:6; 12:24). He is also the sacrifice — He Himself is the new covenant. His teachings are the requirements of the covenant. Faith is required for participation in it. The Holy Spirit is given to transform the heart, and eternal life is the promised inheritance. It is an Eternal Covenant (Heb 13:20), guaranteed by Jesus (Heb 7:22). His blood has made us perfect, and He is making us holy (Heb 10:10, 14).

The New Covenant has phenomenal promises, and all who believe them are counted as righteous. They are considered as faithful to the terms of the covenant. Their allegiance (loyalty and obedience) is given to Jesus Christ.

Our relationship with God is based on the New Covenant. God takes away our sins (Rom 11:27). Jesus died as a ransom to set them free from the sins committed under the first covenant (Heb 9:15). God’s Spirit gives us life (2 Cor 3:6). He puts the terms of the covenant within our hearts and minds so we can be faithful to Him (Heb 8:7-10; 10:16). We may therefore receive the promised eternal inheritance (Heb 9:15).</p>
<h3>
Terms of the new covenant
</h3>
<p>
We now come to the most important part. The New Covenant has been made, and the Old Covenant is obsolete (Heb 8:13). What then are the terms of the New Covenant? Is it simply faith and Spirit added to the old rules? No. Some of the old rules are obsolete.</p>
<p>
The book of Hebrews explains that the sacrifices, for example, are done away with. Hebrews does not say that the sacrifices are obsolete because they were later additions to the covenant. Rather, it is the Sinaitic covenant itself that is obsolete. There has been a change of the law (Heb 7:12). Levites administered the Old Covenant; Christian ministers administer the New Covenant, not the old.</p>
<p>
When we compare the New Covenant with the old, we see both similarities and differences. Some laws of the Old Covenant are continued into the new. The Tenth Commandment, for example, is quoted with approval in the New Testament. As another example, we should still obey: “You shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child.” (Ex 22:22). Even though this commandment is not quoted in the New Testament, the principle is still valid.</p>
<p>
Other laws are transformed in the way we apply them. For example: “Whoever lies with an animal shall surely be put to death.” (Ex 22:19) The prohibition is valid, but the church does not enforce the punishment. Part of the law is valid, and part is not.</p>
<p>
Some laws are simply discontinued, such as: “An altar of earth you shall make for Me,” (Ex 20:24).  And: “You must give me the first born of your sons. Do the same with your cattle and your sheep.” (Ex 22:29-30). The promises of the Old Covenant are also discontinued — Christians do not expect God to drive the Canaanites out of the land.</p>
<p>
The Old Covenant was a package of laws and promises between God and His people. That package is now obsolete. Although some laws in the old covenant continue to be valid, others have ceased to be valid. We cannot assume that any particular law is valid simply on the basis of it being commanded in the old covenant.</p>
<p>
This principle is taught in Gal 3: <font color= "blue"></font>And this I say, that the law, which was four hundred and thirty years later, cannot annul the covenant that was confirmed before by God in Christ, that it should make the promise of no effect.” (Gal 3:17)</font> Paul is not singling out ritualistic laws. He is talking about the entire package of laws that was given four centuries after Abraham. The Sinaitic laws cannot do away with the promises God gave to Abraham.</p>
<p>
In other words, once a promise has been given, conditions cannot be added (Gal 3:15). God knew in advance that the Israelites could not obey the covenant He gave them, and He did not use their disobedience to abandon the promises He had given to Abraham. The old covenant was an addition, given for a temporary purpose. It is now expired, no longer in effect.</p>
<p>
The Galatian Christians had received the Holy Spirit by believing the gospel (Gal 3:2, 5). By believing, they became children of Abraham (Gal 3:7, 29) and partakers of his blessing (Gal 3:9, 14). The Galatian believers had the same covenant with God that Abraham did, and so do Christians today. Paul is explaining that our inheritance depends on promise (Gal 3:18), not on the law of Moses. We are children of God by faith, not by law (Gal 3:26).</p>
<p>
In other words, our relationship with God is based on faith and promise, just as Abraham’s was. We are justified by faith and saved by promise — by grace. Laws that were added at Sinai cannot change the promise given to Abraham, nor can those laws change the promise given to us, since we are Abraham’s children by faith. God gave His oath to Abraham, and He cannot break His promise by introducing new requirements (3:15). The promise still stands.</p>
<p>
Even circumcision, which was given to Abraham as a sign of the covenant, cannot change the original promise, which was given on the basis of faith. Paul points out that Abraham was declared righteous, and therefore acceptable to God, while he was uncircumcised (Rom 4:9-11). The promise in Gen 15 was given without conditions. Abraham is therefore the father of all who have faith, whether they are circumcised or not, and all who have faith can be heirs of the original promise (Rom 4:16). Circumcision, the sign of the covenant, is now a matter of the heart (Rom 2:29). Obedience should be in our hearts.</p>
<p>
However, no one obeys perfectly. Everyone breaks the law. Law cannot give life (Gal 3:21, 10-12). It was never meant to be a means of salvation. All it can do is condemn us. So what was its purpose? It was added because of transgressions and was to be in force only until Christ came (Gal 3:19). The law pointed out our need for forgiveness, our need for grace, our need for a Saviour, and our need for faith.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“But after faith has come, we are no longer under a tutor.” (Gal 3:25)</font>. The law — meaning the covenant added 430 years after Abraham — was temporary, added until the coming of the “Seed” the promise referred to — Christ (Gal 3:19). The Old Covenant was a temporary addition, and it is now obsolete.</p>
>p?
By establishing the new covenant, Jesus set aside the first covenant (Heb 10:9). He did away with many laws, but he also reaffirmed various commands and stressed that obedience should begin in the heart. He also added commands not found in the old covenant at all. The new covenant has behavioural guidance of its own.</p>
<p>
Faith in Christ means allegiance to him. Faith leads us to obey God. All that the Lord has said to us, we should obey. We look to Jesus’ teachings, and the teachings of his inspired apostles, to see the way that Christian faith should work in our lives. Since we always fall short of these New Testament commands, however, they remind us that we are saved only by grace through faith in our Saviour.</p>
<h3>
Righteousness by faith
</h3>
<p>
No one can be declared righteous by observing the law (Rom 3:20). The law cannot give eternal life (Gal 3:21). But the gospel reveals a way in which we can be declared righteous — a way that was predicted by the Law and the Prophets (Rom 3:21; Acts 10:43). “This righteousness from God comes…to all who believe” (Rom 3:22). We can be “justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus” (Rom 3:24).</p>
<p>
God gave His unique Son as a means of atonement for us, so God can declare believers justified — righteous (Rom 3:25-26). No one can boast about observing the law, since the only way anyone can be justified is “by faith apart from observing the law” (Rom 3:28). We are accounted as righteous on the basis of Jesus Christ, and we are given salvation by grace. If we are judged by our works, we will be found guilty. Salvation comes only by grace. God has forgiven us because Jesus died for us; it is because of his one great sacrifice that God forgives all our sins. We are counted as acceptable to God if we have faith in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>
“Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have gained access by faith into this grace in which we now stand. And we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God” (Rom 5:1-2).</p>
<p>
Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, because through Christ Jesus the law of the Spirit of life set me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the sinful nature, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful man to be a sin offering. And so He condemned sin in sinful man, in order that the righteous requirements of the law might be fully met in us, who do not live according to the sinful nature but according to the Spirit. (Rom 8:1-4).</p>
<p>
Since the law could not transform us and could not give us eternal life, God did what the law could not do. He did it by sending His Son as a sacrifice on our behalf. Through faith, through Jesus Christ, we are declared righteous — and we are led by the Holy Spirit and changed in the heart. As we remain in Christ Jesus through faith in Him, we are counted among the righteous, not among the condemned.</p>
<p>
Christians today have a new relationship with God — a covenant based on faith, a faith that is willing to obey God. We do not obey according to the old letter or the Old Covenant, but according to the New, according to the Spirit (2 Cor 3:6). We are ministers of a New Covenant, servants of God based on new terms of relationship. The Old Covenant, with laws that humans were unable to keep, brought condemnation and death. But the glorious New Covenant brings life and righteousness (2 Cor 3:7-9). The law brings condemnation; the ministry of the Spirit brings justification and righteousness (2 Cor 3:8-9). In this passage, Paul is emphasising the differences between the Old Covenant and the New.

“Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom” (2 Cor 3:17). We are forgiven and freed from Old Covenant regulations, and we now serve Christ by living according to the New Covenant. That is the ministry Paul was committed to — preaching the gospel of the glory of Christ (2 Cor 4:1-5). With assurance of salvation, Paul was zealous to preach the gospel (2 Cor 4:13-18).</p>
<p>
In Gal 4:21-25, Paul drew an allegory based on Abraham’s two sons. Hagar, the slave woman, represented the covenant made at Sinai, with its physical centre in Jerusalem. Children of this covenant are slaves, under the law. In contrast, Sarah represents the New Covenant, from above, because her child was the product of promise.</p>
<p>
We are children of promise (2 Cor 4:28), and we are free (2 Cor 4:26, 31). Christ has set us free, and we are not to be enslaved by the yoke of the Old Covenant (2 Cor 5:1), not even by the circumcision that came before that covenant (2 Cor 5:2). But our freedom is not permission to sin — it is for service (2 Cor 5:13). We become slaves of righteousness, exhorted to be transformed in our innermost being, encouraged to conform to the pattern of Jesus Christ, exhorted to abide by New Testament commands.</p>
<p>
Paul makes a contrast between freedom in Christ and “the whole law” (2 Cor 5:1-3). The whole Mosaic law, as a package regulating a people’s relationship with God, is obsolete. “The only thing that counts is faith expressing itself through love” (2 Cor 5:6). We are declared righteous by faith apart from the works of the law. Although faith is accompanied by works (Rom 1:5; 6:17; 12:6-21; James 2:14-17), it is faith and not works that is the basis of our justification and the basis of our relationship with God — the basis of the new covenant in Jesus Christ.</p>
