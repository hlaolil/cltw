<h1>
The Incarnation of Jesus Christ
</h1>
<h3>
Manifested in the Flesh
</h3>
<p>
The word incarnation does not occur in the Bible. It is derived from the Latin in and caro (flesh), meaning clothed in flesh, the act of assuming flesh. Its only use in theology is in reference to that gracious, voluntary act of the Son of God in which He assumed a human body. In Christian doctrine the Incarnation, briefly stated, is that the Lord Jesus Christ, the eternal Son of God, became a man. It is one of the greatest events to occur in the history of the universe. It is without parallel.</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul wrote, blue <font color= "blue">"And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, ..." (1 Tim 3:16)</font>.</p>
<p>
Confessedly, by common consent the Incarnation of Jesus Christ is outside the range of human natural comprehension and apprehension. It can be made known only by Divine revelation in the Holy Scriptures, and to those only who are illumined by the Holy Spirit. It is a truth of the greatest magnitude that God in the Person of His Son should identify Himself completely with the human race. And yet He did, for reasons He set forth clearly in His Word.</p>
<p>
Before we examine those reasons, it would be well at the outset to distinguish between the Incarnation and the Virgin Birth of our Lord, two truths sometimes confused by students of Scripture. The Incarnation of the Son of God is the fact of God becoming Man; the Virgin Birth is the method by which God the Son became Man.</p>
<p>
These two truths, while distinct and different, are closely related to each other and stand in support of each other. If Jesus Christ was not virgin born, then He was not God in the flesh and was therefore only a man possessing the same sinful nature that every fallen child of Adam possesses. The fact of the Incarnation lies in the ever-existing One putting aside His eternal glory to become a man. The method of the Incarnation is the manner by which He chose to come, namely, the miraculous conception in the womb of a virgin.</p>
<p>
A noteworthy passage pertinent to the Divine purpose in the Incarnation is recorded in the Gospel according to John-- blue <font color= "blue">"And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory. the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth" (John 1:14)</font>.</p>
<p>
Cerinthus, a representative of the system which arose in the early church under the name of Docetism, claimed that our Lord had only an apparent human body. But the statement, "the Word became flesh," indicates that He had a real body.</p>
<p>
John 1:14 cannot be fully appreciated apart from:blue <font color= "blue">"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God ... (John 1:1) And the Word became flesh." John 1:14.</font> <br> 
He, who was one with the Father from all eternity, became Man, taking upon Him a human body. He "was with God"; He "became flesh". He “was with God”; He "dwelt among us". From the infinite position of eternal Godhood to the finite limitations of manhood! Unthinkable but true!</p>
<p>
Paul gives another significant passage on the Incarnation in his Galatian Epistle: blue <font color= "blue">"But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, made under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons" (Gal 4:4,5)</font>. In these verses Paul establishes the fact of the Incarnation-- " God sent forth His Son, born of a woman."</p>
<p>
God sending His Son presupposes that God had a Son. Christ was the Son in His eternal relationship with the Father, not because He was born of Mary. Since a son shares the nature of his father, so our Lord shares the Godhead coequally with His Father. Yes, "God sent forth His Son," from His throne on high, from His position of heavenly glory. God did not send one forth who, in His birth, became His Son, but He sent One who, through all eternity, was His Son. Centuries before Christ was born, the Prophet Isaiah wrote of Him, blue <font color= "blue">"For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given; ..." (Isa 9:6)</font>.</p>
<p>
The Son was given in eternity past before we knew Him. His human birth was merely the method of coming to us.</p>
<p>
Again, Paul records the following noteworthy statement in the Epistle to the Philippians: blue <font color= "blue">"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God: but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bond servant, and coming in the likeness of men: and being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself, and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross. Therefore God also has highly exalted Him, and given Him the name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and those on earth, and of those under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father" (Phil 2:5-11)</font>.</p>
<p>
Before His Incarnation Jesus Christ was "in the form of God" (Phil 2:6). From the beginning He had the nature of God, He existed (or subsisted) as God, and that essential Deity which He once was could never cease to be. If He seems Divine, it is only because He is Divine. He is God.</p>
<p>
He "did not consider it robbery to be equal with God" (Phil 2:6). The eternal Son did not consider it a thing to be seized unlawfully to be equal with the Father. Equality with God was not something He retained by force or by farce. He possessed it in eternity past and no power could take it from Him. But in the Incarnation He laid aside, not His possession of Deity, but His position in and expression of the heavenly glory.</p>
<p>
One of the purposes of the Philippian epistle was to check the rising tide of dissension and strife growing out of Christians thinking more highly of themselves than they ought to think. Being a general letter, it exposes no false doctrines but does enunciate our Lord Jesus Christ as the believer's pattern in humiliation, self-denial, and loving service for others. This is evident in the seven downward steps of the Saviour's renunciation of Himself.</p>

(1) "He made Himself of no reputation." God emptied Himself! He did not lose His Deity when He became Man, for God is immutable and therefore cannot cease to be God. He always was God the Son; He continued to be God the Son in His earthly sojourn as Man; He is God the Son in heaven today as He will remain throughout eternity. He is blue <font color= "blue">"Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever" (Heb 13:8)</font>.</p>
<p>
(2) "taking the form of a bond servant." His was a voluntary act of amazing grace, the almighty Sovereign stooping to become earth's lowly Servant. Instead of expressing Himself as one deserving to be served, He revealed Himself as one desiring to serve others. He did not boast His eternal glory and right to be ministered to, but instead evinced His humility and desire to minister.<font color= "blue"> "the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many." (Matt 20:28)</font>.</p>
<p>
(3) "He was made in the likeness of men." This phrase expresses the full reality of His humanity. He participated in the same flesh and blood as man (Hebrews 2:14). Although He entered into a new state of being, His becoming Man did not exclude His possession of Deity, for He was and is today a Person who is both God and Man, Divine and human, perfect in His Deity and perfect in His humanity.</p>
<p>
(4) "and being found in appearance as a man." When He came into the world, Christ associated with His contemporaries and did not hold Himself aloof. Thus He manifested to all that He was a real Man. One obvious distinction marked our Lord's humanity; His perfection and sinlessness. As a Man He was made under the law, yet He never violated the law. As a Man He was tempted in all three points in which we are tempted (1 John 2:16), yet His temptation was apart from any thought, word, or act of sin.</p>
<p>
(5) "He humbled Himself." The world has never witnessed a more genuine act of self-humbling. So completely did our Lord humble Himself that He surrendered His will to the will of His Father in heaven. His desire was to do the will of the Father, therefore He could testify,blue <font color= "blue"> "I do always those things that please Him" (John 8:29)</font>. It was humiliation for the eternal Son of God to become flesh in a stable, and then to dwell in a humble home in subjection to a human parent. God was <font color= "blue">"sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin" (Rom 8:3)</font>. Only eternity will reveal the depth of meaning for Him and for us found in those words, "He humbled Himself.</p>"
<p>
(6) "He became obedient to the point of death." Remarkable indeed! Here the God-man dies. Did He die as God, or did He die as Man? He died as the God-Man. The first Adam's obedience would have been unto life, but because he disobeyed unto death, the last Adam must now obey unto death in order that He might deliver the first Adam's posterity <font color= "blue">"passed from death into life" (John 5:24)</font>. <font color= "blue">"For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive" (1 Cor 15:22)</font>. To subject Himself to the cruel death of a criminal on the cross was a necessary part of God's plan of salvation for men, and to such a death our Lord voluntarily submitted. Implicit obedience!</p>
<p>
(7) "... even the death of the cross." Our Lord died as no other person died or ever will die. Other men had died on crosses, but this Man, the eternal Son of God, voluntarily and willingly died the kind of death meted out to criminals, even the death upon a cross. His own countrymen considered crucifixion the worst kind of disgrace. In their law it was written,<font color= "blue">"For he that is hanged is accursed of God" (Deut 21:23; cf. Gal 3:13)</font> . Not only did our Lord die, but He died bearing the burden of the worst of criminals and the guiltiest of sinners. Down He came from heaven's glory to earth's sin and shame through His Incarnation.</p>
<p>
The purposes underlying this phenomenal occurrence can be summed up in seven points.</p>
<h3>
He came to reveal God to Man
</h3>
<p>
The Incarnation of the Son of God unites earth to heaven. God's greatest revelation of Himself to man is in Jesus Christ. Revelation is the disclosure of truth previously unknown. Before the coming of the Son of God to earth many varied forms of revelation existed. Belief in the existence of God is innate. Since man is a rational, moral being, his very nature provides him with intuitive knowledge. As the mind of a child begins to unfold, it instinctively and intuitively recognises a Being above and beyond the world that he experiences.</p>
<p>
Man is so constituted that he recognizes the fact and the power of God by the things that are made. Many of the ancient philosophers marvelled at the starry heavens above them and the moral law about them. We live in a world of order and harmony conducive to our happiness and well being, and we, too, recognise a revelation of God in nature.</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul wrote, <font color= "blue">"because what may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown it to them. For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse," (Rom 1:19-20)</font>. Men may hinder or suppress the truth by their unrighteous living, but there is that which may be known of God which "is manifest in them." The existence and power of God are discernible to us all by the things we observe in the external world. Those only who have abnormal, distorted, or biased minds can possibly deny God's existence.</p>
<p>
Job realised that the nature of God in its different characteristics and qualities was not all revealed to man, yet he knew, as all men know, that the omnipotence and unchangeableness of God are exhibited in creation (Job 6:10; 23:12). The savage and the scientist can know two things about God; He is a Being and He is supreme. These are the two things God has been pleased to reveal about Himself.</p>
<p>
Do not plead innocence for the man who does not possess a copy of God's Word. All men have a Bible bound with the covers of the day and the night whose print is the stars and the planets. What is knowable about God has been displayed openly, and any man who suppresses the truth does it "without excuse." Nature reveals the supernatural, and creation reveals the Creator. Read Psa 19:1-6 and you will see that the heavens are personified to proclaim the glory of their Creator. Day and night pass on their testimonies giving clear evidence of the existence of the One who made them.</p>
<p>
There are other evidences of primeval revelations of God to man, such as to Adam (Gen 3:8) and to Abraham (Gen 12:1-3; 26:3-5). The writer to the Hebrews quotes the Son speaking to the Father, in which reference is made to an early primitive and temporary revelation through a book which God allowed to pass out of existence (Heb 10:5-7). Doubtless there were other books which likewise have passed out of existence, as the Book of Enoch of which Jude made mention (Jude 14).</p>
<p>
We know, further, that God often revealed Himself in dreams as when He spoke to Jacob (Gen 28), to the patriarch Joseph (Gen 37), to Nebuchadnezzar (Dan 2-4), to Joseph (Matt 1:20), and to others. Through Moses and the prophets God revealed Himself (Ex 3:4,20). Over thirty-five authors, writing over a period of fifteen hundred years, wrote consistently and coherently, by inspiration of the Holy Spirit, of one historically accurate plan of salvation. The Bible in its entirety is a progressive revelation of God.</p>
<p>
But of all the amazing revelations of almighty God, none was set forth more clearly and fully than God's final revelation of Himself in the Person of the Lord Jesus Christ. Since God is an infinite Being, no man could understand Him fully save the Son who is One in equality with the Father. Jesus said, <font color= "blue">"Nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal Him." (Matt 11:27)</font>. Here, then, is one reason for the Incarnation—to reveal God to man. The fact of God's existence may be seen through test tubes and laboratory experiments, detected through microscope and telescope, and stated in the discussions of the seminar. But the glorious attributes of a loving God manifested in behalf of sinners can be found in no place or person apart from Jesus Christ.</p>
</p><font color= "blue">
Philip said to Him, “Lord, show us the Father, and it is sufficient for us.” Jesus said to him, ... He who has seen Me has seen the Father; so how can you say, Show us the Father?" (John 14:8-9)</font>.</p> 
<p>
When the Word became flesh He brought to man an adequate revelation of God. Whatever the ancient seers and saints knew about God before Jesus came, we have a more adequate revelation. Since God remains an abstraction until we see Him in terms of personality, so the Son became Incarnate that we might see and know God.
<p><font color= "blue"> 
"No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him" (John 1:18)</font>.

The dictionary definition of the word "light" means nothing to a blind man, but one glimpse of a glow worm would be worth more for the understanding of light than all the definitions in the world. One glimpse of Jesus Christ will bring God closer to the human mind and heart than all the theological definitions of Him. No man could perceive the grace of God until the almighty Sovereign of the universe stooped to the level of His own creatures, suffering cruel treatment and dying the death of shame for them. No man understood fully the patience and long suffering of the Father until Jesus Christ <font color= "blue">who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but committed Himself to Him who judges righteously; (1 Peter 2:23)</font>. 
<p>
No man can comprehend just how perfect and holy God is until He comes face to face with the sinless Son of God. God has revealed Himself anew to the intelligence of man through the Incarnation.</p>
<h3>
He came to reveal Man to Himself
</h3>
<p>
Through His Incarnation Jesus Christ reveals man to himself. He shows us what we are and what we may become. As we study the purposes of God in Christ, the fact impresses us that man is grossly ignorant of his real self, and that the
mission of the Son's coming included a plan that would enable man to see and know himself as God sees and knows him. We are not the least bit impressed with man's vain philosophical views of himself, but rather with the accurate historical account of man as it is recorded in the Bible.</p>
<p>
The primary fact that man needs to know about himself is his origin. Men are divided in their theories concerning this. We are not strangers to the evolutionary idea which attempts to explain man's place in the earth. In 1871 Darwin published his book, The Descent of Man, but he said very little that had not been said before. The idea of evolution might be here to stay, but not because Darwin said so. Evolution was taught by Roman and Greek philosophers and even by ancient Egyptians. But the evolutionary idea that man must swallow his pride and be content with the fact that he has oozed from the slime along with the snails is contrary to the revelation in Scripture.</p>
<p>
The Bible teaches clearly that the human race had its origin by the immediate creation of God (Gen 1:26, 27) and that man is the grand consummation of all creation. We are forced to accept this view as against the theory of evolution because of the immeasurable gulf which separates man, even in his barest savage condition, from the nearest order of creation below him. Moreover, history corroborates Scripture in that man was destined to rule over all other animal life. God took special care in the creation of man, for <font color= "blue">"God created man in His own image, in the image of God He created him; male and female created He them" (Gen 1:27)</font>. 
</p>
Actually it was not the body of man that was created, for the body was merely "formed" of those elements necessary for man's body and which were created long before man (Gen 1:1). What was new in man's creation was a form of life which only God and man possess (Gen 2:7). Created in the image and likeness of God, man differs from every other form of animal. Man, in his lowest estate, seeks an object of worship and has been known to bow before gods that he cannot see, but animals never!</p>
<p>
However, man did not retain God's image and likeness. When God placed our first parents in Eden He set before them one simple restriction, namely, not to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for, said God, <font color= "blue">"for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die" (Gen 2:17)</font>.
<p>
Gen 3 is a record of the fall of man. He disobeyed God and immediately the life-cord was severed. Adam died both physically and spiritually. Physical death began to do its work, and the grave for Adam was but a matter of time. Then, too, his spirit was separated from God, so that he was dead spiritually while alive physically.</p>
<p>
Now all men, from Adam down, are born into this world spiritually dead in sin, possessing a sin-nature capable of every trespass against God (Eph 2:1). The sin-nature of Adam and the guilt of his sin were imputed to the whole human race, so that Adam's corrupted nature is of necessity a part of all his posterity. The highest self in man is altogether unprofitable to God. All men are not equally corrupt in word and deed, but all are equally dead, and unless the function of death is brought to a halt, it will destroy not only the body but also the soul in hell. Because of the solidarity of the human race, sin and death have passed upon all men (Rom 5:12). When Adam defaced the Divine image and lost the Divine likeness, <font color= "blue">begot a son in his own likeness, after his image," (Gen 5:3)</font>. Yes, <font color= "blue">"by man came death" ..."in Adam all die" (1 Cor 15:21-22)</font>.</p>
<p>
While all of this is clearly stated in the Bible, man still thinks of himself more highly than he ought to think. There were many who had no Scriptures at all in Christ's day, and they needed this revelation. In order that man should see himself, not in the light of his own goodness, but beside the perfect standard of God's holy Son, the Son of God became Incarnate. Our Lord said, <font color= "blue">"If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have no sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin." (John 15:22)</font>.</p>
<p>
Responsibility increases with knowledge, and so Christ's coming showed man how far short he came of God's standard of a righteous man. The Lord Jesus said, <font color= "blue">"If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would have no sin; but now they have seen and also hated both Me and My Father." (John 15:24)</font>. </p>
<p>
Our Lord did not mean by this statement that man would have been without sin if He had not come. There had been sin all along, as God's dealings with the human race through its four thousand years of earlier history prove. But the coming of Christ to the earth revealed the heart of man in cruel hatred for Divine holiness. The Son of God Incarnate was sinless in every respect, yet man, Jew and Gentile alike, crucified Him. Alongside Christ's perfect life and works, man can see the sin and guilt of his own heart.</p>
<p>
When man sinned against the Son of God, he sinned against the clearest possible light, <font color= "blue">"the Light of the world'' (John 8:12)</font>.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
<p><font color= "blue">
He came to His own and His own did not receive Him  (John 1:11)</font>, and then Gentiles joined hands with "His own" to put Him to death. How sinful is the heart of man? Look at that spectacle on Calvary hill and you will see human hearts and hands at their worst.</p>
<p>
Time has not improved human nature. Today men still trample under food the precious blood of Christ, and if our blessed Lord were to appear in person today as He did nineteen centuries ago, the world would crucify him again. The world, having seen the light, has turned from the light, for <font color= "blue">"men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil" (John 3:19)</font>. 
<p>
Rom 1:18 to 3:20 enunciates the most searching and conclusive arraignment of the human race found anywhere, and the birth and death of Jesus Christ attest to the truth of this awful indictment.</p>
<h3>
He Came to Redeem Man
</h3>
<p>
The Apostle Paul states clearly the purpose of the Incarnation in the following words-- <font color= "blue">"But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons." (Gal 4:4-5)</font>.</p>
<p>
The Old Testament contains the accurate record of some four thousand years of sin, human failure, and consequent Divine judgement. The one bright hope was the coming of the promised Seed, the Redeemer (Gen 3:15). With each succeeding revelation from God, the promise grew clearer and the hope brighter. The prophets spoke of the Messiah who would come to deliver the people from their sins. Perhaps the classic prophecy is Isa 53. Since the people needed a deliverer from the guilt and penalty of sin, the intent of the Incarnation was to provide that Deliverer. Moreover, all of history and prophecy moved toward that goal even as all subsequent movements have proceeded from it.</p>
<p>
Jesus Christ is man's Redeemer, his Saviour. This truth is implied in His name. Said the angel, <font color= "blue">"you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins." (Matt 1:21)</font>.</p> 
<p>
At His birth the angel testified again, <font color= "blue">"For there is born to you this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord." (Luke 2:11)</font>. </p>
<p>
Even the Lord Jesus Himself voiced emphatically the purpose of His Incarnation when He said,<font color= "blue"> "For the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost" (Luke 19:10)</font>.</p>
<p>
The awful state of the world of mankind necessitated the coming of the Redeemer since there could be no hope of deliverance apart from Him. The character of God, which is righteousness, absolute and uncompromising, demands that every sin be dealt with. While God is merciful, gracious, and slow to anger, forgiving iniquities and transgressions,<font color= "blue"> "by no means clearing the guilty" (Ex 34:7)</font>.</p>
<p>
While God is love, God is also holy and righteous, so holy that He is <font color= "blue">"of purer eyes than to behold evil, and cannot look on iniquity" (Hab 1:13)</font>.</p> 
<p>
His righteousness demands that every sin must be dealt with impartially. In order to be true to Himself, God had to deal with the problem of sin. In order to deal justly and, at the same time, mercifully, someone had to suffer the death penalty for the sin of the world.</p>
<p>
In the Person of Jesus Christ God solved the problem of the eternal well-being of the sinner. He sent His Son to die as the sinner's perfect Substitute, and thereby redeemed the sinner. Man was lost to God and heaven, and God's purpose in redemption could be realised only through the Incarnate Son of God, for the Son of God Incarnate is the connecting link bringing together God and sinful man. The sinner's relation to Jesus Christ is vital. Christ became a man<font color= "blue"> "that He by the grace of God should taste death for everyone" (Heb 2:9)</font>.</p>
<p>
The Word, who is the eternal Son of God, became flesh and was obliged to be made in the likeness of man in order to redeem him.</p>
<p>
Christ defined the purpose of His Incarnation and earthly ministry when He said, <font color= "blue">"I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance" (Mark 2:17)</font>.</p> 
<p>
There is no implication in these words that there is a sinful class of men who need repentance and another righteous class who do not. Nor is there a suggestion that there are "righteous ones,". <font color= "blue">As it is written: "There is none righteous, no, not one." (Rom 3:10)</font></p>
<p>
Consider the conditions under which Christ stated this purpose. Scribes and Pharisees were upbraiding Him because He had gone into the house of Levi to eat with publicans and sinners (Mark 2:14-16). His critics exalted themselves above sinners, priding themselves in righteousness which thereby excluded them from any realisation or acknowledgement of their own sin.</p>
<p>
In Levi's house, however, there were those who recognised their sinful state. It was for this reason that the Lord Jesus went to that group, namely, to bring salvation to them. Physicians go into sick rooms, not because of the pleasantness of disease and suffering, but because of a desire to relieve and cure the sick. So sinners are the special objects of the Saviour's love and power. He came into the world to save sinners.</p>
<p>
Although all men are unrighteous, those scribes and Pharisees called themselves "righteous," for they were possessed of self-righteousness that is <font color= "blue">"like filthy rags;" in God's sight (Isa 64:6)<font color= </font>. Therefore, as they went about seeking to establish their own righteousness, they failed to see the purpose of His coming. Hence they never heeded the Saviour's call to salvation. Their kind seldom do!</p>
<p>
Had there been righteousness in the human heart, there would have been no need for the Incarnation of the Son of God. And only in the self-righteous heart of the religious, moral man, satisfied with himself, do we find the careless indifference to the Gospel of redemption. When a man assumes a righteousness all his own, he is outside the reach of the Great Physician. The man who excludes his own need of Christ misses the purpose of the Saviour's coming and will not be saved. Each of us must say with the Apostle Paul, <font color= "blue">"This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief" (1 Tim 1:15)</font>.</p>
<h3>
He came to Restrain Satan
</h3>
<p>
The purpose of the Incarnation is further revealed in the Epistle to the Hebrews. Three verses, linked together, assert that the coming of Jesus Christ was to destroy the devil. <font color= "blue">"But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that He by the grace of God might taste death for every man ... Inasmuch then as the children are partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and release those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage" (Heb 2:9,14-15)</font>.</p>
<p>
In these three verses in Hebrews, we are reminded that the subject of death is dealt with in each of them, and the fact of the Incarnation is substantiated in the clause, "who was made a little lower than the angels." Furthermore, the purpose of the Incarnation appears in the words, "that He by the grace of God might taste death for every man." From this verse, as well as Heb 2:14, it is evident that the eternal Son became flesh in order to die.</p>
<p>
Christ's crucifixion by wicked hands was <font color= "blue">"by the determinate purpose and foreknowledge of God" (Acts 2:23)</font>. Our Lord Jesus Christ testified,<font color= "blue"> "The Son of man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many" (Matt 20:28)</font>. Jesus Christ willed to die, not a sudden and unexpected death but a lingering, anticipated death that He would taste every day of His earthly sojourn. He became man to suffer death.</p>
<p>
But why should it be so? We considered the purpose of the Incarnation relative to the sin question. Referring to the matter of death, the Word affirms that the Son of God became incarnate that "through death He might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil." Of all the works of Satan, among the worst is that of destroying life. Our Lord testified, <font color= "blue">"He was a murderer from the beginning" (John 8:44)</font>.</p> 
<p>
Satan is the spoiler of humanity, his malignant purpose being to bring both physical and spiritual death to mankind.</p>
<p>
God placed our first parents in the Garden of Eden with<font color= "blue"> every tree grew that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil." (Gen 2:9)</font>. </p>
<p>
Eating the fruit of the latter tree would bring sin and death, for, said God,<font color= "blue"> "In the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.”" (Gen 2:17)</font>.</p> 
<p>
Satan knew this, therefore we are not surprised when we read that it was of the fruit of this very tree of death that he enticed Eve to eat. He chose the tree of death because he is a murderer. He knew that the death sentence was already pronounced upon all who would eat of it. He delighted in the fall of Adam and Eve, for he knew that physical and spiritual death had struck.</p>
<p>
But thanks be to God for the Incarnation of His Son. By the coming of Jesus Christ into the world, through His death and resurrection, He wrested from Satan the power of death. Death no more holds its lethal grip upon the believer. Although death has held sinners in bondage ever since the severing of the life-cord between God and man, the appearing of the Lord Jesus has broken its grip. <font color= "blue">"According to His own purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began ... the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who has abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel" (2 Tim 1:9-10)</font>.</p>
<p>
Before sin was indulged in and death struck, the inclusive salvation plan provided death's abolition. Since the death and resurrection of our Lord dealt comprehensively with sin, it of necessity affected death. The coming of the Saviour rendered death harmless, and the "sting" of it is gone (1 Cor 15:55). Oh, the blessedness of an accomplished redemption! How wonderful to know Him who said,<font color= "blue"> "I am He that lives, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; And I have the keys of Hades and of Death" (Rev 1:18)</font>.</p> 
<p>
Death once held man in the vice of hopeless doom, but now Satan is defeated.</p>
<p>
The shadow of the cross hung over the manger in Bethlehem, assuring the world that the Seed of the woman would bruise the serpent's head (Gen 3:15). As Adam yielded himself to Satan, Satan held him in death; but by His dying, Christ entered into our death and wrested from Satan that power which he held over us. At Calvary Satan was brought to naught, and now <font color= "blue">"Death is swallowed up in victory.” ... Thanks be to God, which gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ" (1 Cor 15:54,57). "The prince of this world is judged" (John 16:1 1)</font>.</p> 
<p>
The Seed of the woman traversed the realms of death but was not captured by the enemy. Instead, He conquered the enemy. Thank God the Saviour came.</p>
<h3>
He came to Rescue the Whole Creation
</h3>
<p>
The Incarnation of the eternal Son is part of the divine plan. That plan comprehends a goal, and God assures the accomplishment of it. Though the salvation of man was God's chief concern, His plan was never limited to the world of mankind. It is written of the eternal Son, who was with God and who is God, that <font color= "blue">"all things were made through Him" (John 1:3)</font>.</p> 
<p>
Paul writes, <font color= "blue">"For by Him all things were created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth" (Col 1:16)</font>. </p>
<p>
Man was higher than all other created beings in the earth, and other creatures were subject to him. However, after the fall this condition changed. Now if man is to have dominion over the beasts, he must first capture them at the risk of his own life, and then imprison them until they are tamed. All of this resulted from the fall.</p>
<p>
But the question is, Will God restore again to man the dominion which he lost through the fall? The prophet said, <font color= "blue">“The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, the leopard shall lie down with the young goat, the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; and a little child shall lead them. The cow and the bear shall graze; their young ones shall lie down together; and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. The nursing child shall play by the cobra’s hole, and the weaned child shall put his hand in the viper’s den. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all My holy mountain, for the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the sea." (Isa 11:6-9)</font>.</p>
<p>
Indeed, it appears that the prophet here is looking beyond to a time of rescue and restoration of the earth and all of its creatures.</p>
<p>
The cruelty of beasts was not the order before sin entered. Such discord among God's creatures has sprung from the sinfulness of man and is a necessary part of the curse. To remove this curse and rescue God's creation is one of the purposes of the Incarnation. When Christ comes back to reign and <font color= "blue">"the government will be upon His shoulder" (Isa 9:6)</font>, then the sons of God will be manifested and will share with Him in a restored creation. If it were not so, then all of animated nature would remain spoiled by Satan. </p>
<p>
But God has said,<font color= "blue"> "In that day will I make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the air, and with the creeping things of the ground" (Hosea 2:18)</font>. </p>
<p>
Yes, God will <font color= "blue">"gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are on earth, - in Him'' (Eph 1:10)</font>. </p>
<p>
At that day our blessed Lord will<font color= "blue"> "reconcile all things to Himself' (Col 1:20)</font>.</p>
<p>
Many Christians fail to see that this redemptive work, wrought through the Incarnation of the Son of God, is wider than the salvation of human beings and that it affects the whole creation. The Apostle Paul writes,<font color= "blue">"For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly waits for the revealing of the sons of God.  For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it in hope; because the creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groans and labours with birth pangs together until now. Not only that, but we also who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body. (Rom 8:19-23)</font>.</p> 
<p>
Here we are told that the deliverance of the whole creation will be revealed at the manifestation of the sons of God.</p>
<p>
All creation lies in hope (expectancy) of a rescue from present corruption and of deliverance to that place God gave it in the beginning. Nature is now under the curse of sin, groaning and travailing in pain. It is not what it was at first. Nor is it now what it will be when the incarnate Son returns to "put all things in subjection under His feet" (see Hebrews 2:5-9). Before Adam sinned, no savage beasts, no desert wastes, no thorns and thistles existed; but when he fell, all creation fell with him. Now that the Son of God has come and purchased redemption by His death at Calvary, the whole creation must be rescued from the curse, and restored to its original state.</p>
<h3>
he came to Restore Israel
</h3>
<p>
Any reader of the Old Testament cannot escape the clear teaching that the Messiah was promised to Israel. Of this the prophets spoke and wrote. The Jews had great advantages. <font color= "blue">"to them were committed the oracles of God" (Rom 3:2)</font>. </p>
<p>
Theirs was <font color= "blue">"the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises" (Rom 9:4)</font>. None can deny that from the call of Abraham (Gen 12:1) to the Babylonian captivity under Nebuchadnezzar (606 B.C.), authority in the earth and divine representation was vested in the Jews. It is common information that since the overthrow of Jerusalem and the transfer of dominion in the earth to the Gentiles, Israel, as a nation, has not held authority in the earth.</p>
<p>
When Jesus Christ, the Word, "was made flesh," "He came to His own, and His own received Him not" (John 1:11,14).<font color= "blue"> "His citizens hated Him, and sent a delegation after Him, saying, We will not have this man to reign over us" (Luke 19:14)</font>.</p> 
<p>
In blind unbelief the children of Abraham, refusing to recognise or receive Him, drove Him from their midst and crucified Him. After His resurrection and ascension He revealed to the apostles this mystery. No longer did Israel have priority on the truth, but the message was to be spread abroad to every creature and, during the present dispensation of grace, God would <font color= "blue">visit the Gentiles to take out of them a people for His name (Acts 15:14)</font>.</p>
<p>
When Christ came the first time He traversed Palestine proclaiming,<font color= "blue">"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand" (Matt 4:17)</font> .
<p>
He opened the door into the kingdom, but only the regenerated could enter. Were the people ready to receive the kingdom, the King would establish it. However, the offer of the kingdom met with an ever-increasing opposition, and our Lord withdrew the offer for that time. He said to the Jews, <font color= "blue">"Therefore say I to you, The Kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bearing the fruits of it" (Matt 21:43)</font>. </p>
<p>
There was no mistaking what the Lord Jesus meant, for the chief priests and Pharisees <font color= "blue">"perceived that He was speaking of them." (Matt 21:45)</font>.</p>
<p>
Israel is still set aside, but only temporarily. The Apostle Paul writes, <font color= "blue">"I say then, has God cast away His people? Certainly not! ... God has not cast away His people whom He foreknew ...  For I do not desire, brethren, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own opinion; that blindness in part has happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in" (Rom 11:1-2,25)</font>.</p>
<p>
Anti-Semitism, raging throughout the world today, might lead one to question the future restoration of the Jews. Yet we know that both national restoration and national regeneration for the Jews are a definite part of the plan of God. Israel is not beyond recovery; she is not irretrievably lost. By her fall the whole world was blessed with the message of salvation. A national tragedy resulted in an international triumph. <font color= "blue">"And so all Israel shall be saved" (Rom 11:26)</font>.</p> 
<p>
The Jews lives in a dark present with a bright future before him. When our Lord said in Matt 21:43, that "the kingdom shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof," He was not referring to any Gentile nation but to regenerated Israel.</p>
<p>
God gave Palestine to the Jews unconditionally as a possession and a dwelling place (Gen 12: 1-3). He wants them there. That the Jews would be scattered is plainly taught in the Word of God, but coupled with such teaching are the assertions that they will also be regathered. Study Hosea 3:4,5 and see plainly the scattering and the gathering with the period between. (See also Ezekiel 36: 19,24). The Word became flesh and tabernacled among them once (John 1:14). That same holy One, the incarnate Christ, will come again to tabernacle with Israel. Study, for example, such passages as Isa 12:1-6; Joel 2:26, 27; Zeph 3:14-17; Zech 8:3-8. Already modern inventions have revolutionised Palestine and its surrounding territory. This fact, coupled with the thought of the vast area granted by God to Abraham 1 Gen 15: 18), will assure any interested person that there is ample room in the Holy Land to hold all Jews.</p>
<p>
While the Jews continue to return to the Land, all signs point to the return of the incarnate Son, the One who is both human and Divine, and the One in whom God's purposes for Israel are to be fulfilled. According to prophecy, the incarnate One, Immanuel, the virgin's Son, is to occupy David's throne. <font color= "blue">"For unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given: and the government shall be upon His shoulder: and His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The Mighty God, The Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. Of the increase of His government and peace there will be no end, upon the throne of David, and over his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgement and with justice from that time forward even forever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this" (Isa 9:6-7)</font>.</p> 
<p>
Let us rejoice to see that day approaching.</p>

HE CAME TO REIGN

When the Incarnation had been announced, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying, "Where is He that is born king of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the east, and are come to worship Him" (Matthew 2:1, 2). They were wise men indeed, for they were followers of the truth of God. When the Old Testament prophets wrote of Messiah's offices, they included that of King. "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, thy king cometh unto thee: He is just, and having salvation: lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass" (Zechariah 9:9). David wrote of Christ and His kingdom when he recorded the words of God, "Yet have I set My king upon My holy hill of Zion" (Psalm 2:6). Our Lord is not only Prophet, and Priest, but also Potentate.

In studying the purposes of the Incarnation we are forced to the scriptural observation that the eternal Son became Man in order that He might be King of the earth. Paul wrote that "God hath highly exalted Him" (Philippians 2:9). We dare not limit the exaltation of Christ as some try to do. We acquiesce with those who teach that the steps in Christ's exaltation were His resurrection, ascension, and His sitting at the right hand of God. But such teaching does not go far enough. Study carefully Philippians 2:5-11, and you will see that the steps in our Lord's humiliation were temporary steps leading to a permanent exaltation, culminating with the bowing of every knee and the confessing of every tongue in heaven and in earth, that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.

The incarnate Son is to appear in His resurrection body and is to sit on the throne of His glory. Jesus Himself spoke of the day "when the Son of man shall come in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him; then shall He sit upon the throne of His glory" (Matthew 25:31). John writes, ''Every eye shall see Him'' (Revelation 1:7). The prophetic utterance spoken by God to David in 2 Samuel 7:12-16 concerning David's seed having an everlasting throne and kingdom, has a double fulfillment. Primarily it referred to Solomon's temple. Ultimately and finally it speaks of Christ's earthly reign as Zechariah 6:12 shows. The day must come when all things will be subjected unto Him (I Corinthians 15:28).

The Psalmist spoke of His throne as an enduring throne (Psalm 89:4, 29, 36). God promises that this earthly throne and kingdom are to continue forever, and that the One to occupy it shall be David's seed, his rightful Son (I Chronicles 17:11). The genealogies in Matthew 1 and Luke 3 will support the relationship of Jesus Christ to David. During our Lord's earthly ministry, those who sought His help called Him "the son of David" (see Matthew 9:27; Mark 10:47; Luke 18:38).

Christ's kingdom is literal, therefore it cannot be realized apart from the Incarnation. Such a kingdom men have been trying to establish for centuries, but nations are farther from realizing it today than ever before. A perfect kingdom demands a perfect King. At the end of the conflict of the ages, Jesus Christ, the God-Man will return to earth to establish His righteous kingdom which will never be destroyed. His kingdom of glory, and His throne in the midst, was God's first promise through the mouth of the angel Gabriel to Mary, and it links together the Incarnation and reign of the Son of God, ''And behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS. He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto Him the throne of His father David: and he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of His kingdom there shall be no end" (Luke 1:31-33).

When the King comes, then will His perfect will be done in earth as it is in heaven. This is a blessed truth not without history or hope. The day will surely come when all men will see the revelation of the glory of holiness and joy in the earth. But His reign awaits His return to carry away His Bride, the Church. Everything has been deferred until He gathers her unto Himself. It may be at any moment that the last soul will be added to the Church, and then He will come.

This meditation in no wise exhausts the divine purposes of the Incarnation. Others have written at greater length and, doubtless, we could do likewise. But one thing more must be said. The supreme purpose in the eternal Son's coming into the world was to glorify the Father. In His great intercessory prayer, Jesus said, " I have glorified Thee on the earth: I have finished the work which Thou gayest Me to do" (John 17:4). God had been glorified in creation, in the remarkable deliverances of His people, and in the exercise of His power over His enemies, but at no time had He been glorified like this. God could never have been glorified if the Son would have failed in His earthly mission in the smallest degree. But the Lord Jesus could say, " I have finished the work which Thou gayest Me to do." Nothing was left undone, and in everything He did, the Son had the Father's glory in view. He glorified the Father; His earthly mission was complete.

And now to all of us who have been redeemed by His precious blood, the Apostle Paul writes: "For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's" (I Corinthians 6:20).
