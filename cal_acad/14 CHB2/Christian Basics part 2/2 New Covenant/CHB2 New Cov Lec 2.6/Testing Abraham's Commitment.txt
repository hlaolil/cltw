<h1>
Testing Abraham's Commitment
</h1>
<h3>
God's promise to Abraham
</h3>
<p>
The sixth account of God's promise to Abraham appears in Gen 18 in a setting immediately before the destruction of the sin-infested cities of Sodom and Gomorrah. Abraham's angelic guests—messengers with news about the divine punishment to come on the two cities—reconfirmed the soon-coming birth of a son to the 99-year-old Abraham and his wife, Sarah, 10 years his junior (Gen 18:10-14).
With God promising that He would not "hide" His intentions from Abraham (Gen 18:17; Amos 3:7), the angels then visiting the aged patriarch affirmed the promises that Abraham would "surely become a great and mighty nation"—a physical, material and national commitment of immense scope. They also reconfirmed the messianic promise that "all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him" (Gen 18:18).
Dramatically fulfilling the promise, about a year after this encounter Sarah gave birth to Isaac (Gen 21:1-3). First Abraham had proven himself faithful to God. Now, miraculously, God proved His faithfulness to His commitment to Abraham.</p>
<h3>
Abraham's supreme test
</h3>
<p>
The climax of these seven accounts of God's promises appears in Gen 22. Here we find one of the most significant events in the Bible. This is God's final elaboration to Abraham of His promise.</p>
<p>
In this account Abraham's willingness to sacrifice Isaac foreshadows the foundational event of God's plan to offer salvation to all — God's willingness to offer His only Son, Jesus Christ, as a sacrifice (John 3:16-17).
Earlier we noted that God's promises were dependent on Abraham's continued obedience (Gen 12:1;17:9). But after the events of Gen 22 God transformed His covenant with Abraham by elevating it to a new level — and with good cause.
God told Abraham to take Isaac, the son of the promise (Rom 9:9), and sacrifice him as a burnt offering on Mount Moriah (Gen 22:2). Abraham's supreme test of faith had arrived.</p>
<p>
By this time in his life Abraham had learned to trust God implicitly. He had long experienced God's wisdom, truth and faithfulness. He proceeded to do as he was told, only to be miraculously stopped at the precise moment he would have slain his son (Gen 22:9-11).</p>
<h3>
Lessons to be learned
</h3>
<p>
We can learn several profound lessons from this incident.</p>
<p> 
First, God—whether in ancient or modern times—has never sanctioned worshipping Him with a human sacrifice.</p>
<p>
Second, God prohibited Israel from following the pagan practice of offering first born children as sacrifices to idols. Human sacrifice was part and parcel of the Mesopotamian society from which Abraham was called, as well as the nations around him. But God made sure his faithful servant would not actually slay his son, although Abraham did not know in advance what God had in mind.
In the next verse God's words reveal what He really wanted to find out about Abraham: "Now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me" (Gen 22:12). In his willingness to obey the living God, Abraham had proven that he would relinquish that which was most precious to him, his only heir (Gen 22:16; compare John:3:16). God did not want Abraham's son as a sacrifice. But He did want to know if Abraham trusted Him enough to make the hardest choice God could put before him. Abraham passed the test.</p>
<p>
Third, Abraham's behaviour demonstrated he was a man fit for the role of "father of all those who believe" (Rom:4:11-22; Gal:3:9; Heb:11:17-19) — that he was a suitable founder of the family of countless descendants who could become the people of God (Gen:18:19).</p>
<p>
However, God could not complete the plan He initiated through Abraham without involving the problem of human sin, and that problem would later require the sacrifice of humanity's Redeemer—Jesus the Messiah, the Lamb of God (John:1:29).
God's commitment becomes unconditional
At this point God's promises to Abraham—physical and spiritual—became unconditional. His words, "By Myself have I sworn" (Gen 22:16), show that the fulfilment of the promise no longer depended on Abraham. The fulfilment of the promise would now depend solely on God Himself. He unconditionally committed Himself to fulfil His promise to Abraham and his descendants.
God puts His own truthfulness and integrity on the line in these commitments. He has unconditionally bound Himself to bring all of His promises to pass in all their details.
Because we understand the unconditional nature of God's promises, we have a better picture of what to look for down through history concerning the descendants of ancient Israel. Since God cannot annul His promise to Abraham because He will not break His word (Num 23:19), every detail in His promises becomes a guide in our search for the identity of the lost 10 tribes of Israel after their exile.
Gen 22 concludes with God restating the central elements of His commitment to Abraham: "Indeed I will greatly bless you, and I will greatly multiply your seed as the stars of the heavens, and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your seed shall possess the gate of their enemies" (verse 17, New American Standard Bible). These physical, material and national blessings continue as clues to the identity of Abraham's modern descendants.
God continued: "And in your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice" (Gen 22:18). The apostle Paul, commenting on this verse many centuries later in Gal 3:16, explains that this promised blessing refers to Jesus Christ: "Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his seed. He does not say, 'And to seeds,' as referring to many, but rather to one, 'And to your seed,' that is, Christ". Through Christ, as the Seed of Abraham, God would make salvation available to the whole of humanity (compare John:3:16).
