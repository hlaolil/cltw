<h1>
The Elements of Agreement
</h1>
<p>
There is a teaching out there these days called "Touch and agree" which goes along these lines: If two believers on the earth will agree about anything then God has promised that He will honour that request. One of the by products of this doctrine is that certain proponents claim that they are "anointed" to agree with you in prayer for your needs and that if you will plant a "seed" in their ministry that the "increase" is assured. Is this truly what the Bible teaches?</p>
<p>
Where do they get this doctrine? Aside: (by "they" I mean those that adhere to this doctrine.) The basis for this teaching is:<br>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Again I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they ask, it will be done for them by My Father in heaven." (Matt 18:19)</font></p> 
<p>
The preceding verse sounds like it supports the doctrine of "touch and agree" asking God to grant prayer requests, and thinking they will be granted because two agree, but let's look closer. The most common cause for misinterpretation of Scripture is to quote it out of context which establishes a wrong premise and then to build upon this poor foundation. This is the case here. Let's look at the surrounding passages and see if a context can be established.</p>
<p>
In the passages prior to these that surround the base Scriptures for "touch and agree" Jesus had held up a child and said that to be saved one must become like a child with childlike faith. He then said it would bring horrible judgement upon any who offended such a person.<br> 
What is the subject? The subject is the judgement of the offenders of those who have this childlike faith. </p>
<p>
Now let us consider: <font color= "blue">""Moreover if your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother. But if he will not hear, take with you one or two more, that 'by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.' And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church. But if he refuses even to hear the church, let him be to you like a heathen and a tax collector. Assuredly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. Again I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they ask, it will be done for them by My Father in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together in My name, I am there in the midst of them." Then Peter came to Him and said, "Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?." (Matt 18:15-21)</font> At the end of Jesus' exhortation Peter ask how often should he forgive an offender. The subject was still one of judgement but the focus of Peter's question was forgiveness for the offender who repented. Now to the passages in question.</p>
<p>
Imagine if you will the process described in the intermediate passages: A brother or sister, not an unbeliever has committed an offence and you have gone to him yourself and have privately discussed the issue at hand. If he repents you are to forgive him and you have gained or restored your brother to fellowship, not only with you but with God. If your brother does not repent, what then? After the refusal of the offender you as the one to restore him are then to go and get one or two other believers to "establish" or witness to the facts of the case and to offer their judgement in the matter as to the brother's repentance. If he listens you are to forgive him. If he does not you are to call this brother (or sister) before the church and call the witnesses who have established "all things" through their examination.</p> 
<p>
Now we are at the misinterpreted verse (Matt 18:19) that is thought to support the teaching of "touch and agree.". Here we stand in front of the "called out body of believers" or the church with the unrepentant offender of one of his brothers with the childlike faith. I ask you, is this the time to take prayer request? Would a statement like "Would you like me to touch the Throne of grace and agree with you Sister Sorrow that you get a new house and a husband?" be appropriate at this juncture? I think not.</p>
<p>
If the passage is taken in this the original context one quickly sees that the "two or three gathered in His name" are doing so as witnesses to the offence which a brother or sister has not yet repented of and the "all things" they are to agree to are the particulars of the charge and the accused's unrepentance. If the offender while in front of the church will repent he is to be forgiven and the process of restoration begins. If he does not then and only then does the aspect of "what so ever they shall ask" come into effect. This is the "binding and loosing" spoken of in the passages. The assertion is that what the assembly allows or permits or imposes as a sanction carries the same weight as if Jesus Himself had been one of the members that cast this judgement.</p>
<p>
Any independent confirmation of this doctrine? Consider: <font color= "blue">"If a matter arises which is too hard for you to judge, between degrees of guilt for bloodshed, between one judgement or another, or between one punishment or another, matters of controversy within your gates, then you shall arise and go up to the place which the Lord your God chooses. And you shall come to the priests, the Levites, and to the judge there in those days, and inquire of them; they shall pronounce upon you the sentence of judgement. You shall do according to the sentence which they pronounce upon you in that place which the Lord chooses. And you shall be careful to do according to all that they order you. According to the sentence of the law in which they instruct you, according to the judgement which they tell you, you shall do; you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left from the sentence which they pronounce upon you. Now the man who acts presumptuously and will not heed the priest who stands to minister there before the Lord your God, or the judge, that man shall die. So you shall put away the evil from Israel. And all the people shall hear and fear, and no longer act presumptuously." (Deut 17:8-13)</font></p>
<p>
Now consider that we are the "Royal Priesthood" who are in Christ by baptism in His name and the indwelling of his Spirit and it should be clear as to the meaning of "touch and agree".

Is this the only argument that can be raised in rebuff of this doctrine? The Bible says: </p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"And there is no creature hidden from His sight, but all things are naked and open to the eyes of Him to whom we must give account. Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathise with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin. Let us therefore come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need." (Heb 4:13-16)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
And again: "If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask Him!" (Matt 7:11)</font></p> 
<p><font color= "blue">
And: "But you, when you pray, go into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. And when you pray, do not use vain repetitions as the heathen do. For they think that they will be heard for their many words. Therefore do not be like them. For your Father knows the things you have need of before you ask Him." (Matt 6:6-8)</font></p>
