The Prayer of Faith - 1
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him. (Heb 11:6)</font></p>
<p>
To believe as well as to offer prayers of faith, is to agree with God's plan, it is to agree that His plans are good and that He is able to bring it to pass. Before any prayer can be deemed effective, before it can come up to the Lord as an offering pleasing unto Him and receive the authority in addition to the power that would make it to come to pass, this condition of the heart must be met.</p>
<p>
But where there is doubt, this condition is breached, doubt operates in ways that says, is this true, can God do this, is this His will for me and for my generation? You see while we often associate unbelief to doubting the power of God to bring our prayer request to pass, there is another side of unbelief which easily goes unnoticed, and it is the one which questions the will of God on the subject of the prayer being offered to Him.</p>
<p>
When someone prays for healing and wonders in his mind if it is the will of God for him to be healed, such operate in unbelief that struggles to accept the goodness of God. Such would usually say "I have no doubt that God can heal me if He wants to, but I just don't know if it is His will for me", well such a heart needs to see unbelief in action especially when going against the word of God which declared boldly the following about the will of God especially with the salvation that He gave to man;
<font color= "blue">And behold, a leper came and worshipped Him, saying, "Lord, if You are willing, You can make me clean." Then Jesus put out His hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing; be cleansed." Immediately his leprosy was cleansed. (Matt 8:2-3)</font></p>
<p>
If the position of "and that He is a rewarder" is not met especially where it has to do with the attributes that defines the nature of God in relation to our prayer request, then it must be said that such prayers is being offered in unbelief.</p>
<p>
Take for example, when Abraham was asked by Isaac where is the ram to be offered, Abraham simply replied or with the benefit of hindsight we could say he decreed. "The Lord will provide". Where did this information come from, where did this blessed assurance come? People will say faith, well no one doubts that, but where did the faith come from? Once again people would say from hearing the word of God, to which again I say undoubtedly, but what did he hear in those words?
<font color= "blue">After these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision, saying, Do not be afraid, Abram. I am your shield, your exceedingly great reward. (Gen 15:1)</font> </p>
<p>
When we pray and our heart does not fully agree with who God says He is, then doubt has crept it in. What to do? Deal with the doubt, go back and meditate on the attributes and nature of God as it has to do with the prayer requests, and only when we are fully convinced should we come back with the prayer request.</p>
