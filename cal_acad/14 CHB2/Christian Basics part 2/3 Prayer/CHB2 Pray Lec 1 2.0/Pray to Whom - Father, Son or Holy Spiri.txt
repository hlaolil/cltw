<p>
Each person of the Trinity is fully God and fully worthy to receive your prayer. You may address your prayer to the Son, the Father or the Holy Spirit with confidence depending on how you feel led at that moment.</p>
<p>
The Trinity is certainly a difficult concept for anyone to understand. It is a mystery how God can be one God in three persons, so the best we can do is accept what the Bible says about God's nature, even if we don't fully comprehend.</p>
<p>
To which person of the Trinity should we pray? Certainly, there is no question that we can pray to God the Father. The Old and New Testaments are filled with examples of prayer to the Father, and Jesus Himself taught us to pray to the Father in Matt 6:9-13.</p>
<p>
There is also no question that we can pray to Jesus. As an example, Stephen prays <font color= "blue">"Lord Jesus, receive my spirit." (Acts 7:59)</font> Jesus told us that we would be able to pray to Him after He had gone to the Father. He said,<font color= "blue"> "... because I go to My Father. And whatever you ask in My name, that I will do, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. If you ask anything in My name, I will do it." (John 14:12-14)</font></p>
<p>
The issue with the Holy Spirit is more complicated. There are no examples of anyone praying to the Holy Spirit in the scripture, nor is there any guidance that we should or should not do so. As a person of the Trinity and one who is fully God, there is no obvious reason why we should not pray to the Holy Spirit if we are led to do so. For me personally, I pray to the Holy Spirit whenever I feel stress or unease and I am seeking peace and comfort. I am not sure why I do this, but it seems appropriate.</p>
<p>
Having said that, the Holy Spirit does play a special role in interceding for us when we are praying to the Father or to the Son. Many times in the New Testament we are told to pray "in the Spirit." Paul tells us <font color= "blue">"praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit," (Eph 6:18)</font></p>  Jude recommends, <font color= "blue">"... building yourselves up on your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit," (Jude 1:20).</font></p>

Paul gives us some clarification about the role of the Holy Spirit.<br>
Paul writes, <font color= "blue">"Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered." (Rom 8:26)</font></p>
<p>
So, although it is perfectly acceptable to pray to the Holy Spirit, scripture suggests that we pray "in the Spirit", which means we permit the Holy Spirit to guide our prayer and give us the right words to say.</p>
<p>
There is no right or wrong. You may address your prayer to the Son, the Father or the Holy Spirit with confidence depending on how you feel led at that moment.</p>
