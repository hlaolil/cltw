<h1>
Unbelief Stops Deliverance
</h1>
<p>
If I were to approach any Christian today and pose the question, “Do you believe God’s Word?,” I have no doubt his or her response would be a resounding “Yes!” Well, if you believe His Word, why aren’t you getting answers to your prayers? Why are you continually plagued by the same problems, ailments, fears, and worries year after year? Let me tell you why. </p>
<h3>
Unbelief
</h3>
<p>
Often, when Christians don’t get answers to their prayers, they blame it on their lack of faith. They think, “I’ll just have to keep building my faith muscles until I develop water-walking faith like Jesus had.” But in reality, nothing could be further from the truth!<br>
<font color= "blue">“God has dealt to each one a measure of faith.” (Rom 12:3)</font> According to this scripture, all Believers received the measure of faith at the point of salvation. Salvation is a free gift, and so is faith (2 Peter 1:1). So if you’re not getting results in life, the issue is not a lack of faith; it’s the presence of unbelief.</p>
<p>
Let me explain and give you an example. There’s a story in the book of Matthew where a father brought his son to Jesus’ disciples to cast out a demon that was causing the boy to have violent seizures. The disciples had cast out many demons before this incident, but they couldn’t cast this particular demon out (Matthew 17:14-16). So clearly, their faith wasn’t the issue at hand. What, then, was the issue?</p>
<p>
When Jesus’ disciples approached Him and asked why they couldn’t cast out the demon, His response was, <font color= "blue">“Because of your unbelief” (Matt 17:19-20)</font>. The situation the disciples witnessed before them was obviously horrendous. But instead of trusting God’s infallible Word, they were influenced by natural unbelief. We operate in natural unbelief when we allow our five senses to lead us. The disciples allowed what they could see, feel, and touch in the natural to carry more weight than God’s Word. The result was unbelief. And when unbelief is present, it cancels out faith and renders your prayers ineffective.
Fear, worry, the cares of this world, and stress are all evidence of unbelief. Do you fear the Word won’t work for you? Do you harbour negative thoughts or expectations? Are you more consumed with a problem right now than the solution? If so, unbelief is present in some area of your life.</p>
<h3>
Overcoming Unbelief
</h3>
<p>
In order to overcome unbelief, you must overcome fear-based thoughts. You do this by <font color= "blue">“casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ, (2 Cor 10:5)</font>. The moment a destructive thought enters your mind, open your mouth and speak the Word! Then heed Phil 4:8-9, which instructs us to think on things that are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, and of a good report.</p>
<p>
Natural unbelief is overcome through fasting and praying. Fasting and praying trains your body to believe the Word instead of your physical senses (Matt 17:21). You become more in tune with your spirit and the Holy Spirit dwelling within you.</p>
<p>
If your faith isn’t working, examine your life for areas of unbelief. Be brutally honest with God and yourself. As He shows you these areas, make a commitment to meditate on the Word day and night, pray the Word, fast, guard your mind, choose pure thoughts and speak and confess the Word only! True Believers believe God’s Word! Their evidence is tangible, visible manifestation of answered prayers in every area of their lives!</p>
