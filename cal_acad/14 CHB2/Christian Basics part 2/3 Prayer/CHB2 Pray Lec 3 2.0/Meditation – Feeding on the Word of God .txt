Meditation – Feeding on the Word of God 
</h1>
<h3>
Heroes of Faith Meditate
</h3>
<p> 
“Meditate” is the word God uses when He speaks to us in the Old Testament about handling scripture. God gives Joshua instruction for leading the Israelites into the Promised Land:<br> 
This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate in it day and night, that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success. (Josh 1:8)</p>
<p>
David was clearly one who meditated on God’s word. For example: 
My eyes are awake through the night watches that I may meditate on Your Word. (Psa 119:148)<br> 
Your Word have I hidden in my heart. (Ps 119:11)</p> 
<h3>
Meditation Defined 
</h3>
<p>
A total change for the better.</p> 
<p>
This word “meditate” comes from the Hebrew word “hagah” (#1897, Strong’s). It means:<br> 
• To moan, mutter, ponder, imagine<br> 
• To contemplate something as you repeat the words</p> 
<p>
This Hebrew use of “meditate” is quite different from our contemporary meanings for the word. The early Hebrew practice of repeating scriptures quietly as you contemplate their meaning comes close to what we would understand to be the re-programming of our minds. <br> 
And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. (Rom 12:2)</p> 
<p>
The word “renewing” in the Greek, “anakainosis”, indicates a total change for the better. <br>
We have potent promise here:<br> 
• Meditate on the Word<br> 
• Bring about great change for the better <br>

Meditation is anything but busy-work. It is a powerful tool for changing the circumstances of our own lives and the circumstances of those things that concern us. Scripture meditation that leads to scripture proclamation is like a secret weapon that has been hidden away from those too young, or too irresponsible, to use it.</p> 

Jesus says: 
If you abide in Me, and my words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you. (John 15:17) Can you feel the motivational power in Jesus’ statement? 

Make the time to meditate on, abide in, His word! As you do, those words of scripture that have engraved in your heart will easily rise up in prayer. You will experience a new confidence that comes through the life of the Word in you. </p>
<h3>
This process in practice
</h3>
<p> 
• Take a line or two of scripture and quietly repeat those lines to yourself over and over. <br>
• There is something about our own hearts hearing the Word in our own voice ... neuroscience would tell us now that such a practice reprograms our sub-conscious ... in this case, for success. Remember, God made an impressive promise to Joshua if he would do this meditating day and night.</p>
<h3>
Believing and Agreeing with God 
</h3>
<p>
When we invest time in meditating on scripture, we develop strong belief in our hearts. What we believe in our hearts will always win over what we know in our heads! Now we have scripture that we practically know by heart combined with strong belief (faith). Praying from such a position puts us into perfect agreement with God. He’s just been waiting for that! The power of heaven comes pouring in on us and on the situation(s) for which we’ve been praying. </p>
<h3>
Feeding on the Word 
</h3>
<p>
Isn’t this exciting? And there’s more ... Think of meditation as eating:<br> 
<font color= "blue">"Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God". (Matt 4:4)</font> 
<font color= "blue">
Your words were found and I ate them, and Your Word was to me the joy and  rejoicing of my heart. (Jer 15:16)</font>  
<font color= "blue">
Oh, taste and see that the Lord is good; Blessed is the man who trusts in Him. (Psa 34:8)</font> </p>
<p>
Think of sinking your teeth into a delectable bite of food. You don’t hastily chew and swallow it. You chew slowly ... savouring. You chew more, enjoying all of the subtle nuances of flavour. And when you finally do swallow the delicacy you’ve been chewing, the memory of it lingers.<br> 

That lingering memory can stay fresh for years…sending us back to that special restaurant 200km away ... or digging through the old recipe collection hoping to recreate the masterpiece pie that Grandma used to bake.</p> 
<p>
When we feed on scripture the same phenomenon is possible ...<br> 
• savour the delight of discovery <br>
• enjoy subtle nuances of meaning <br>
• have a memorable encounter with the Divine</p> 
<h3>
Now Let’s Feast! Try It!
</h3>
 <p>
• Find scripture that has a strong draw for you. 
• Chew it (repeat) slowly, over and over. Suck the juice out of it. Taste the subtleties.<br> 
• As you chew, it will get bigger ... bigger in this sense: you will begin to understand this scripture in broader terms. You will see application of it to your own life and circumstances that you haven’t recognised before. 
<font color= "blue">Call to Me, and I will answer you, and show you great and mighty things which you do not know. (Jer 33:3)</font> 
• Then prayer begins to flow. Don’t be fooled into thinking that this is just your own mind. The Holy Spirit is using your grey matter to expand you in understanding and responding to the things of God.<br> 
• Keep a notebook of these scriptures and resulting prayers. You’ll be amazed at how fresh and alive they are in your spirit every time you return to them.

Little Helps With Scripture Meditation 
</h3>
<p>
• Make a tape of one or more scriptures, repeated over and over. Listen to the tape when you are engaged in mindless activities. This strategy is powerful for memorisation and reprogramming the mind. However, this is probably not a good one for driving. Your concentration on traffic could be compromised.</p> 
<p>
• Put a fresh scripture on your computer screen every few days. Then use it as reinforcement of your meditation time. </p>
<p>
• Record these scriptures in your day-planner as a reminder. </p>
<p>
• Write your scripture on several index cards to be placed above the kitchen sink, on the bathroom mirror ... any place you spend a few quiet moments that can be used as a review.</p> 
<p>
• Print those scriptures in large letters on the family white board. </p>
<p>
• Write them in coloured chalk on your driveway ... or some other creative, out-of-the-box ways.</p>
<p> 
The point is ... reinforce! ... and take heart with what Andrew Murray says, “Open your whole heart to God’s words of promise in all their simplicity and truth! They will search us and humble us. They will lift us up and make us glad and strong."</p>
