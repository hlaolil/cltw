Understanding Prayer
</h1>
<p>
The Christian believes in prayer implicitly because of his confidence in the testimony of the Scriptures – divinely inspired documents, buttressed by a wide variety of incontestable evidences. The Bible affirms that <font color= "blue">The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much. (James 5:16)</font>.</p>
<p>
Further, the Christian believes in the power of prayer because Jesus Christ, the best and wisest Person who ever lived upon this earth, utilised the avenue of prayer. Jesus is represented as praying some fifteen times in the four Gospel records. We are, therefore, confident of the power of prayer.</p>
<p>
But prayer is greatly misunderstood, and, in fact, is a force shrouded in mystery. First, there are laws associated with effective prayer. Jesus said, for example: <font color= "blue">“If you abide in Me, and My words abide in you, you will ask what you desire, and it shall be done for you.” (John 15:7)</font>. This indicates that valid prayer requires an “in Christ” relationship, and personal fidelity to the teaching of Jesus. Even the comprehensive “what you desire” must be balanced against prayer limitations mentioned elsewhere in Scripture.</p>
<p>
May one confidently pray for the immediate resurrection of a departed loved one who has been in the grave five years? Certainly not. Why? Because such would require a miracle, and the age of miracles is past. Suppose a study is initiated of a group of ten amputees. If “Christians” pray for five of them, but not for the other five, do you suppose that the prayed-for five will grow new limbs?</p>
<p>
The responses of God to prayer are veiled and much too complicated to be subjected to statistical analysis.

<font color= "blue">“Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgements and His ways past finding out! "For who has known the mind of the Lord? ...” (Rom 11:33-34)</font>.
What if one’s illness was providentially allowed by God for a special purpose (as in Job’s case), and prayer was made for removal, but, seemingly, it proved ineffectual? 
The life of David’s baby was taken by God in spite of the king’s prayers (2 Sam 12:15ff). And yet, king Hezekiah’s life was extended fifteen years because of his prayer (2 Kings 20:1-7). One would know nothing of the heavenly movements orchestrating these situations except for explicit divine revelation.</p>
<p>
How does one “scientifically analyse” the unrevealed workings of the Creator? And what about the circumstances involving Epaphroditus and Paul? The former was rescued from the very jaws of death (Phil 2:25ff), whereas Paul’s “thorn in the flesh” was not removed, though the apostle prayed fervently for that result (2 Cor. 12:7-8). Put that under the microscope and analyse it!</p>
