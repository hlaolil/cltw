<h1>
Defeating The Devil
</h1>
<p>
Can people in our day and age really believe in Satan, an actual devil? Why not? With so many people believing in reincarnation, astral projection, and other New Age beliefs, why not a devil? Unlike those other beliefs, belief in Satan is clearly taught in the Bible, in addition to being an article of faith for Christians for two thousand years.</p>

Maybe we've outgrown the old pictures of the devil, with horns, a pitchfork, and a pointy tail. Fine. The Bible shows no concern about the devil's looks. The Bible is concerned with a spiritual being that acts in direct opposition to a loving, merciful God who wants people to lead full, rewarding lives.</p>

"But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, surely the kingdom of God has come upon you." (Matt 12:28)</font><br>

Then the seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name." And He said to them, "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven. Behold, I give you the authority to trample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you.  Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rather rejoice because your names are written in heaven." (Luke 10:17-20)</font>

"that word you know, which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, and began from Galilee after the baptism which John preached: 38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him." (Acts 10:37-38)</font></p>

When Jesus appeared to Paul on the Damascus road, He specifically mentioned tearing down the works of the devil:

"I am going to send you to the Gentiles, to open their eyes so they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God. Then they will receive forgiveness for their sins and be given a place among God's people, who are set apart by faith in me." (Acts 26:18)</font>

The apostle Paul, like Jesus, understood the incredible power of Satan. He understood even better that God was much stronger, and would ultimately triumph.

The Bible's classic passage about our safety from Satan is Paul's Letter to the Ephesians. It reminds us that, frail though we are, we have a divine "armour" to protect against the powers of darkness.

Put on the whole armour of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. Therefore take up the whole armour of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand. Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth, having put on the breastplate of righteousness, and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.  And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God;. (Eph 6:11-17)</font></p>

Humble yourselves before God. Resist the Devil, and he will flee from you. Draw close to God, and God will draw close to you. (James 4:7-8)</font></p>

Be careful! Watch out for attacks from the Devil, your great enemy. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for some victim to devour. Take a firm stand against him, and be strong in your faith. Remember that Christians all over the world are going through the same kind of suffering you are. (1 Peter 5:8-9)

When people keep on sinning, it shows they belong to the Devil, who has been sinning since the beginning. But the Son of God came to destroy these works of the Devil. Those who have been born into God's family do not sin, because God's life is in them. So they can't keep on sinning, because they have been born of God. So now we can tell who are children of God and who are children of the Devil. Anyone who does not obey God's commands and does not love other Christians does not belong to God. (1 John 3:8-10)
