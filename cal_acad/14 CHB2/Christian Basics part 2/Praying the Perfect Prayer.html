Praying the Perfect Prayer
</h1>
<h3>
Praying in the Spirit
</h3>
<p>
The world is in turmoil. Virtually every headline in today’s media broadcasts signifies reports of gloom and doom. However, during this time, you can receive wisdom and insight. God’s wisdom will enlighten your path so you will know what to do when you do not know what to do. This light, or wisdom, that only comes from God is available to you through the Holy Spirit.<br>
<font color= "blue">“Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water, But a man of understanding will draw it out.” (Prov 20:5)</font> Like pulling water from a deep well, you can draw out of your spirit solutions to life’s problems by praying the perfect prayer, which is praying in the spirit (also known as praying in tongues). </p>
<p>
Praying in the spirit is one of the best ways to pray because you pray the perfect will of God. Not only that, but you also pray about things you are not aware of. Through tongues, the Holy Spirit intercedes for others through you in a way that is superior to anything you could pray in your own language. The enemy cannot interfere with this type of prayer because he does not know what you are saying! In fact, your own mind, will, and emotions cannot get in the way of your prayer. Moreover, praying in the spirit is an act of faith.</p>
<p>
When you pray in tongues, you are praying in your heavenly language—a language you did not know before. It is a supernatural ability that fine-tunes your ability to receive instructions from the Lord. While praying this powerful prayer, you depend solely on the wisdom of God, not on your own intellect. Human wisdom will fail in these last days. That is why it is crucial for you to have the wisdom that comes directly from the Lord operating in your life. </p>
<p>
Because of the misconceptions about praying in tongues, many people shy away from, and even get offended when you mention this subject. <br>However, the ability to speak in an unknown tongue is a gift from God, and evidence that the Holy Spirit dwells on the inside of you. <br>This prayer connects you to the mysteries of God. <font color= "blue">“For he who speaks in a tongue does not speak to men but to God, for no one understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries.” (1 Cor 14:2)</font>. </p>
<p>
Every born-again Christian possesses the ability to pray in tongues, including you! This perfect prayer is directed by the Holy Spirit, not you.<br> <font color= "blue">“Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.” (Rom 8:26)</font><br>
When you pray in tongues, release your faith and ask God to give you the interpretation of those things you pray. He will speak things to your spirit that may surprise you. You will receive revelation knowledge from Heaven, hidden wisdom to get ahead in life. </p>
<p>
Praying in tongues is a grace gift. The revealed knowledge you receive through praying the perfect prayer will give you the edge you need to rise above today’s challenges. Any Christian, at any time, can pray to the Lord and receive this grace gift. Any Christian who has already received it can use it at any time.<br> So, what are you waiting for?</p>
