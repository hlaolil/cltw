Wives
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Husbands, likewise, dwell with them with understanding, giving honour to the wife, as to the weaker vessel, and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers may not be hindered.” (1 Peter 3:7)</font>.</p> 
<p>
A humble husband has his heart open to the Lord and seeks to follow Christ’s commands. He submits to His Saviour Jesus before he expects submission from his wife. A humble husband hears from God before He seeks to direct his family. It is because of his position of humility that his prayers are not hindered.</p>
<p>
In addition, a husband who has a humble spirit is considerate and caring for his wife. He makes her feel special on a daily basis. Humility acts in a respectful and loving manner, always watching for ways to honour God’s gift—his wife. <br>Love and respect are twin characteristics of humility that tower over pride.</p>
<p>
A humble husband is quick to admit he does not know everything; consequently, he values his wife’s opinion and advice. Before a major decision, he leads his wife in prayer to their heavenly Father asking for His wisdom and direction. <br>She is assured knowing that he, as the spiritual leader of the home, is accountable to almighty God. Humility attracts trust.</p>
<p>
A humble husband sees Jesus as his model of humility that leads to obedience. <font color= "blue">
“And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross” (Phil 2:8)</font>. <br>
Humility follows Jesus wherever He leads.</p>
<p>
Powerful prayers flow from the heart of a humble husband. On his knees he battles against the enemy on behalf of his family. He understands his responsibility to represent God in the home. His attitude toward almighty God strongly influences his wife and children’s attitude toward the Lord.<br> He totally trusts the Lord and leads his family to do the same.</p>
<p>
What is happening in your heart? Is it proud or humble under Christ’s authority? Have you accepted your position as the spiritual leader of your home?<br> If so, engage with your wife as joint heirs of God’s gracious gift of life. <br>Learn to love her like the Lord loves her. Admit your wrongs, ask her forgiveness, and serve her well—so your prayers will prosper for God’s glory.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Then the Lord said to me, “Go again, love a woman ... just like the love of the Lord” (Hosea 3:1)</font>.</p>
<h3>
Question 
</h3>
<p>
Do I humble myself daily before the Lord and my wife? Does she normally feel my love and respect for her? Do I love her as much as Christ loved the church?</p> 
<p>
The Bible teaches us to:<font color= "blue">
 “Trust in the Lord with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.” (Prov 3:5-6)</font></p>
