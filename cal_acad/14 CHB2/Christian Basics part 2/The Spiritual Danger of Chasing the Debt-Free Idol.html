   <h1>
The Spiritual Danger of<br> Chasing the Debt-Free Idol
</h1>
<p>
We live under the assumption that once we get or obtain something we will finally catch the happiness that seems to allude us.  The problem is that once we get that illusive thing that was supposed to make us happy, we just start to pursue something else assuming that once we have that item we will be happy.  That’s why happiness evades us.</p>  
<p>
Debt-free living can be one such idol.  It can be one such thing that we believe will solve all our problems and ills.</p>
<h3>
What is an Idol?
</h3>
<p>
The best resource on modern day idolatry is Counterfeit Gods.  That’s the best place to go to get a full definition of idolatry.<br>

For now, let’s just say that an idol is anything we allow to get closer to our hearts than God.  It is anything we think will give us a bigger pay off than our relationship with God.  Yes, this can include something good.</p>
<h3>
Signs of Debt-Free Idolatry
</h3>
<p>
The belief that everything will be better when you are debt-free.<br>
A passion to be debt-free that is greater than any other level of passion you feel.
Assuming the emotional pay off associated with debt-free living is greater than any other emotion you can feel.<br>
Isn’t it normal to expect for debt-free living to be amazing?<br>
We often think our lives will have a higher quality when we achieve or accomplish something.  If we think this way, it means we feel like something is lacking in our lives right now.  Yes, there may be things that we need to change and improve, but have we not already been filled with Christ?</p>
<p>
I think we need to temper our thoughts regarding debt-free living with these words by Paul:
<p><font color= "blue">
Not that I speak in regard to need, for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content: I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in all things I have learned both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need. (Phil 4:11-12)</font></p>
<p>
Contentment does not mean that we ought not have any dissatisfactions in life.  However, Christian contentment calls us to realise that we already have what can give the greatest hope, joy, satisfaction, and meaning.  Debt free or in debt, I can enjoy the peace of Christ.  I can enjoy hope, satisfaction, and meaning.</p>
<p>
Just as we shouldn’t seek out another purchase to make us happy, nor should we assume that getting debt-free will remove all the ills in our lives.<br>

As a society, I wonder if we don’t expect too much from debt-free living. <br> I have a controversial post called six false assumptions about debt free living.  I’m a proponent of debt-free living.  I practice it and teach it.<br>  However, our expectations of debt-free living can be too high.  I’ve said this to secular people, and this truth is even more poignant for Christians.</p>
<p>
To become debt-free is great.  But it pales in comparison to having the hope of Christ.</p>
<h3>
Is Financial Peace an Economic State or a Spiritual Promise?
</h3>
<p>
Do we get financial peace when every debt is paid off and every bill collector has settled?
Do we get financial peace when we recognise that God has control over our whole lives including our finances?
In other words, does financial peace come when we submit to Christ and His will for us or when we’ve completed all our financial goals?

I believe when we submit to Christ, we submit our finances.  We begin to share in the grace of giving.  We recognise any unhealthy motivations for debt like lack of self-control, and we submit to Him. <br>We lay out a plan for change, but throughout the process we have financial peace because we’ve submitted our will to His.</p>
<p>
Will the peace we experience be delayed, or is it offered at the point of our submission to Christ?</p>
<h3>
Even good things can become idols.
</h3>
<p>
We can convince ourselves that once we become debt-free we will have the happiness, peace, and fulfilment we’ve always sought. <br> Joy, peace, hope, and contentment have not been reserved only for those who have paid off their debts.</p>
