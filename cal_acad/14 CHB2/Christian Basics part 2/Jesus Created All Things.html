   <h1>
Jesus Created All Things
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
“For by Him all things were created that are in heaven and that are on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers. All things were created through Him and for Him." ... "For it pleased the Father that in Him all the fullness should dwell,” (Col 1:16,19)</font>.</p>
<h3>
The Sufficiency of Christ
</h3>
<p>
Sometimes it seems the Christian life is simply an ongoing discovery of the sufficiency of Christ. We come to faith by the work of the Holy Spirit and believe that Jesus alone can save us, thereby receiving eternal salvation (John 3:1–15), and yet we need to be reminded again and again that Jesus alone is also the key to life after conversion. If we are honest with ourselves, all of us have at least acted otherwise, though many of us have believed otherwise as well.</p> 
<p>
Maybe, for a time, we lived like the Galatians, who thought that God would really love them only if they dotted every “i” and crossed every “t” of the Mosaic law. If so, we forgot that God loves us on account of the perfection of Jesus our substitute (Gal 2:15–21; 3:10–14). It could even be that we acted like the false teachers in Colossae, turning to diets, superstitions, and other things for spiritual help, not because we denied verbally Jesus’ sufficiency but to make sure all our religious bases were covered (Col 2:16–19).</p>
<p>
Paul’s answer to all these errors is this — Christ alone is sufficient, and believers mature as we take hold of this truth in our beliefs and actions (Col 1:24–29). The apostle’s revelation about our Savior’s identity in Col 1:16,19 reveals clearly the sufficiency of Christ. Jesus, we read, is the self-existent, eternal agent of God’s creative acts described in Gen 1–2. Or, as John 1:1–18 puts it, Jesus is the Word — the Logos who is God and is with God. In Him all things were made, including the lesser principalities and powers whom the Colossian false teachers trusted (Col 1:16; 2:18). Their hope in angels for spiritual advancement was misplaced because it meant turning from the Creator to creatures.</p>
<h3>
The Fullness of God
</h3>
<p>
Christ came to bring peace between God and mankind. (see also John 3:16). This idea in itself is marvellous! Christ’s job was to restore harmony between us. What sin disrupted, Jesus restored.</p>
<p>
To do this, Christ entered into the world with the fullness of God dwelling permanently in Him as part of His nature, not as something that was given to Him to help Him accomplish this task. He was fully God and yet willingly became fully man so He could usher in a contract of peace for us. He became a delegate for both parties, the result was the reconciliation of all things, and this pleased the Father.
