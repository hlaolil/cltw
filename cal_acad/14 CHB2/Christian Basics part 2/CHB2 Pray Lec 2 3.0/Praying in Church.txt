Praying in Church
</h1>
<p>
Prayer is talking to God. The Christian who relies on the Bible as his or her source of revelation about God finds the purpose, practice and meaning of prayer in the teachings of Jesus.</p>
<p>
The Bible introduces us to different types of prayer.<br>
<font color= "blue">
Praying always with all prayer and supplication in the Spirit,  being watchful to this end with all perseverance and supplication for all the saints--. (Eph 6:18)</font>
<br><font color= "blue"> 
Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men, (1 Tim 2:1)</font>
<br><font color= "blue">
Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; (Phil 4:6)</font></p>
<p>
Based on a brief review of the above scriptures we can identify four broad ways of talking to God, namely:</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Supplications</font></p>
<p>
(sometimes translated petitions, entreaties or requests)
Supplication means to petition or entreat someone for something. A passionate zeal and hunger fuels the prayer of supplication. Strictly speaking supplication is not another form of prayer but an attitude that accompanies prayer. Read more on supplication.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Intercessions</font></p>
<p>
To intercede means to plead or mediate on behalf of another person. Intercession will involve various degrees of supplication. Intercession is not normally a one-off prayer. It requires persistence (Luke 11:5-8; Luke 18:1-5).</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Prayers</font></p>
<p> 
Prayer of faith, Prayer of agreement and Prayer of dedication or consecration. In practise there is much overlap in all of these prayers. Read more on prayer.</p>

Thanksgiving</font></p>
<p>
Thanksgiving should be a regular part of our talking to God. Thanksgiving is an all-inclusive act that involves praise, worship and honour of God. Read more on thanksgiving.</p>

Summary
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks be made for all men, for kings and all who are in authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and reverence. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, who desires all men to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth. (1 Tim 2:1-4)</font>
In practise we all use different types of prayer during our prayer times. What may start out as a prayer of faith can soon develop into intercession with supplications. There is no reason why we cannot apply any of the above types of prayers to all the situations that face us.</p>
<p>
If any of the above types of prayers are absent in your life then you should seek God's face about it. Ask Him to fill you with more of His love and make your prayer life richer.</p>
