Have you ever noticed how water, when set on a hot stove for a prolonged period of time, will begin to boil? As the temperature of the stove rises, the water’s activity increases. The longer it remains on the stove, the faster the water reaches its boiling point. </p>
<p>
God desires for your prayer life to take on the same fervent quality as boiling water. James 5 says,<font color= "blue"> “The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much.” (James 5:16)</font> What a powerful statement! Isn’t it exciting to know that you are the one who determines the results you receive through prayer? When your prayer life reaches its boiling point, that’s when the blessings of God spill over into every area of your life. According to Webster’s Dictionary, fervent means, “ardent; passionate; very hot.” </p>
<p>
When you allow your prayers to “get hot,” so to speak, Scripture says that you will “avail much.” In other words, you’ll get the job done in the spirit realm. This type of fervency is not for show or to try and prove how “spiritual” you are. No, fervent prayer comes straight from the heart; it is the Holy Spirit rising up within you to cause a spiritual flood of power that cannot be contained. That is why you may see a believer whose prayers have reached the boiling point pace the floor, cry, rock back and forth or get excited. While you may not have the same outward physical manifestation of fervency that another brother or sister has when he or she prays, God will display Himself through you in His own way. The ultimate proof of how “hot” your prayers are can be seen in your life: You will see positive, lasting results. The Holy Spirit will pray through you in an undeniable way, and you will see the manifestation of what you have prayed. </p>

Jesus’ prayers were dynamic, because we see throughout the New Testament that He got results every time (Matt 14:23; Luke 22:41; Luke 5:16; Luke 9:28,29). I believe that the power of God that was demonstrated in Jesus’ ministry was amplified by the fact that He had a fervent and consistent prayer life. Just like Jesus, you, too, can see tremendous victory in your life by tapping into His secret to success. How do you get your prayers to become fervent? The key is found in Psa 119, which says, <font color= "blue"></font>Oh, how I love Your law! It is my meditation all the day.” (Psa 119:97)</font> </p>
<p>
When your spirit becomes saturated with the Scriptures through diligent meditation, your heart will become established on the solid rock of the Word. It is the Word of God that produces the power behind prayer. It builds confidence; it causes your faith to become unshakable. I don’t know about you, but I want to have the same dynamic, explosive results in my prayer life that Jesus did. You can too, if you tap into the power of God’s Word as your prayer foundation. Only then will your prayers take on miracle-working power and you’ll begin to see your circumstances change. Become a walking expression of God’s power in the earth by letting your prayers reach the boiling point! </p>
