The Power of Love
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting, but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head--Christ--from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the effective working by which every part does its share, causes growth of the body for the edifying of itself in love. (Eph 4:14-16)</font></p>
<p>
A recurrent and prevailing theme in Paul’s theology is spiritual maturity. <br>In our text Paul makes it clear that maturity isn’t the goal, but maturity is the strength that will allow us to accomplish the goal of a church built and operating on love.
The church was constructed by Christ to run on love, mature love. </p>
<h3>
Stability
</h3>
<p>
that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting, (Eph 4:14)<p>
<p>
Paul knew that good people are always targets for those who want something and don’t have much of a conscience when it comes to how they achieve their goals. </p>
<p>
Stability in the life of a Christian is something that develops because the believer takes the time and patience to become a disciple. And it doesn’t happen overnight, but rather over time, and with attention given to God’s Word. <br>Paul wrote to his young protégé Timothy:<br>
<font color= "blue">
Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. (2 Tim 2:15)</font></p>
<h3>
Speaking Truth in Love 
</h3>
<p>
but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head--Christ-- Eph (4:15)</p>
<p>
Jesus Christ is our standard for how we act. Everywhere you look in the Scriptures Jesus told people the truth, and it was always because He loved.</p> 
<p>
It is one maddening trait we humans have that we’d rather see a train run over a friend than take the risk that in speaking truth we might hurt feelings. <br>It’s true that some people are like a bull charging through a china shop when it comes to interpersonal relationships. But that still does not get us off the hook about telling the truth. Truth without love is brutality so we must be sensitive and caring when we talk to each other, but love without truth doesn’t exist! </p>
<h3>
Cooperation 
</h3>
<p>
from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the effective working by which every part does its share, causes growth of the body for the edifying of itself in love. (Eph 4:16)</p>
<p>
A physical body is inter-dependant on the various parts. My stomach would have a tough time digesting food and sending nutrition through the bloodstream if my hands and arms decided to go on strike. If my eyes go on vacation I’m going to have a hard time not bumping into things. 
The Body of Christ isn’t any different. We need each other, and cooperation in Christ’s family enables us to be Missional. This is what Paul calls being “knit” together. Chaos is brokenness; Christ, our peace heals us, knits us back together.</p>
<h3>
Why is this so vital?
</h3>
<p>
All of what the apostle Paul wrote promotes the growth of the Body of Christ. Imagine what happens when you have stable, mature Christian believers refusing to settle for less than truth with each other, and cooperating with everything they’ve got in the mission of the church to share the love of Jesus. Just imagine.</p>
<p>
The church was designed to run on the fuel of love. With the stability of truth and love cooperating we can function in our mission to this community to bring about peace, mercy and justice in the name of Christ. We can do that together.</p>
