<h1>
The Faithful Provider 
</h1>
<h3>
A Father Characteristic
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. (1 Tim 5:8)</font></p>
<p>
God has given father's wisdom and ability to be providers for their families. All that fathers need to do is diligently seek God's will and do what is right in the Lord. A father should do everything legally possible to provide for their family.</p>
<p>
Fathers being good providers for their family is a serious responsibility according to the Bible. 1 Tim 5:8 goes as far as to say that a father denies their Christian faith if they shirk the support of their family. God has made everyone of us for a purpose. For fathers a key purpose and characteristic of being a father is to support their family.</p>
<h3>
Inheritance
</h3>
<p>
Inheritance is the gift of support given by a father to his sons and/or daughters. It is meant for the provision and well being of the family. Most important, however, is his responsibility to make sure children are aware of the inheritance they will receive if they follow Christ. In this way, he can provide for the children in the greatest way possible.
<p>
The New Testament does not speak of a physical inheritance but rather a spiritual inheritance. In fact, in Luke 12:13-21, Jesus downplays the importance of an earthly inheritance, explaining that it can lead to greed and an obsession with wealth. It is far better to store up treasures in heaven. Our inheritance, like the Israelites, is from God (Acts 20:32; Eph 1:11,14,18).</p>

Back in your grandpa’s time, a man was just expected to bring home the bacon and was excused from being too hands on in the child rearing department. Today’s man is expected not only to be a provider, but also a highly involved parent.</p>
<p>
Leave work at work. Obviously, this is not always going to be possible; sometimes you’ll need to continue your work at home. But during dinnertime, bath time, story time, and any other time in which you are focusing on your kids, turn off the cell phone.</p>
<p>
While the focus of this article is about balancing work with your children, make sure to focus time on your wife, too. One piece of advice that I hear over and and over again from people is if you want to be a good father, then be an awesome husband. Call a babysitter, and take your wife out on a date. Make time every day to talk to each other. Right before bed when the children are asleep is a good time. And don’t let work or being a dad get in the way of your sex life with your wife.</p>
