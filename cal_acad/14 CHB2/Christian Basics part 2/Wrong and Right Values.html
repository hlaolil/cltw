<h1>
Wrong and Right Values
</h1>
<p>
Not only are we to ask God for our daily provision, but we also are warned against stockpiling material wealth and other treasures on earth:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. <br>(Matt 6:19-21)</font> </p>
<h3>
Treasures in heaven
</h3>
<p>
“Treasures in heaven” is not a vaporous reference to kindly thoughts in God’s heart or some such platitude. God’s kingdom will ultimately rule on earth. “Treasures in heaven” are things of worth in God’s coming kingdom, such as justice, opportunity for everyone to be productive, provision for everyone’s needs, and respect for the dignity of every person. The implication is that we would do better to invest our money in activities that transform the world, than in securities that protect our accumulated surplus.</p>
<p>
Is it wrong, then, to have a retirement portfolio or even to care about the material things of this world for ourselves or for others? The answer is again both no and yes. The no comes from the fact that this passage is not the only one in the Bible speaking to questions of wealth and provision for those who are dependent on us. Other passages counsel prudence and forethought, such as, <font color= "blue">“But he who gathers by labour will increase.” (Prov 13:11b)</font>, and,<br> <font color= "blue">“A good man leaves an inheritance to his children’s children,” (Prov 13:22)</font>. <br>
God guides Joseph to store up food for seven years in advance of a famine <br>(Gen 41:25-36), and Jesus speaks favourably in the Parable of the Talents <br>(Matt 25:14-30) of investing money.<br> In light of the rest of Scripture, Matt 6:19-34 cannot be a blanket prohibition.</p>
<p>
But the yes part of the answer is a warning, summed up beautifully here,<br> “where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.” (Matt 6:21)<br> We might expect this sentence to run the other way, “Where your heart is, there your treasure will be also.” <br>But Jesus’ actual words are more profound. Money changes the heart more than the heart decides how to handle money. Jesus’ point is not “You tend to put your money into things that matter to you,” but, “the possessions you own will change you so that you care more about them than about other things.” <br>Choose carefully what you own, for you will inevitably begin to value and protect it, to the potential detriment of everything else.</p>
<h3>
The Treasure Principle
</h3>
<p>
We may call this the “Treasure Principle,” namely, that treasure transforms. Those who invest their deepest treasure in the things of this world will find they are no longer serving God but money.<br> <font color= "blue">You cannot serve God and Mammon. (Matt 6:24)</font>. That can lead to anxiety coming from the uncertainties of money (Matt 6:25-34). <br>Will it be eroded by inflation? Will the stock market crash? Will the bonds default? Will the bank fail? Can I be sure that what I’ve saved will be enough to handle anything that could possibly happen?</p>
<p>
The antidote is to invest in ways that meet people’s genuine needs.<br> A company that provides clean water or well-made clothes may be investing in the kingdom of God, whereas an investment that depends on politically motivated subsidies, overheated housing markets, or material shortages may not. This passage in Matt 6 is not a rule for portfolio management, but it does tell us that our commitment to the ways and means of God’s kingdom extends to how we manage such wealth as we have.</p>
<p>
The question, then, is what kind of attention you should pay to material needs and the accumulation of resources. If you pay anxious attention, you are foolish. <br>If you let them displace your trust in God, you are becoming unfaithful. <br>If you pay excessive attention to them, you will become greedy. If you acquire them at the expense of other people, you are becoming the kind of oppressor against whom God’s kingdom is pitched.</p>
<p>
How are we to discern the line between appropriate and inappropriate attention to wealth?<br> Jesus answers, <font color= "blue">“But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.” (Matt 6:33)</font>.<br> First things first. Despite our large capacity for self-deception, this question can help us observe carefully where our treasure has put us.<br> That will tell us something about our hearts.</p>
