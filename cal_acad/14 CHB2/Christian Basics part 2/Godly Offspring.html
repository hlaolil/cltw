Godly Offspring
</h1>
<h3>
God seeks Godly offspring 
</h3>
<p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Then God said, "Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth."
So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. And then God blessed them, and said, "Be fruitful and multiply; fill the earth and subdue it;... (Gen 1:26-28)</font></p>
<p>
You see, ultimately God created man and woman to become the image of God, not just made in the appearance, but to be made in the very image of God – <br>to ultimately have His glory, His character, His law, His values. <br>And that process began here, right at the very beginning. </p>
<p>
God began with a marriage and He blessed that union at the very beginning. That tells us something about how important it is to God and how valuable family and marriage is to Him. It was a union blessed by God and they were given the charge to have lots of children to fill the earth – to replenish the earth and they were given the charge to raise Godly offspring bearing the image of God. As I said, that's a very high calling.</p>
<p>
So the very first and most important step in raising Godly offspring is to have a genuine, Godly marriage. The best gift that we, as parents, can provide our children with is a stable, secure, loving husband and wife relationship. <br>That's where it has to start. We need to invest first in our relationship as husbands and wives. That's the best gift that we can give our children.<br> God ordained marriage. He blessed it before children. He placed a special sanctification in that sense on it. God intended for marriage to be established first which then lay the foundation for the raising of Godly children.<br> The marriage is first priority. God made Eve and He brought her to Adam and He blessed their union. He did that first and they became the first family.</p>
<h3>
Children to Love and Respect and Obey Parents
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. Honour your father and mother," which is the first commandment with promise: "that it may be well with you and you may live long on the earth." (Eph:6:1-3)</font><br>
The Biblical model says children are supposed to obey. Parents, do our children listen and obey us as their parents, because the problem is not usually with the child in that relationship. Children don't automatically grow to love and respect and obey, but they do have an intrinsic need and love for guidance and direction. Parents need to give instruction and discipline that provides the moral guidance for children to obey, that provides the environment that encourages and promotes that obedience.</p>
<h3>
Establishing Trust
</h3>
<p>
I think we understand in the dynamic of family that mothers are more naturally given to the care and nurture of the children, they are more naturally connected. Our relationship of trust automatically develops in normal circumstances.<br> So trust more naturally exists between a mother and a child, but you and I, as fathers, have to work much harder at establishing trust. The quantity and quality of trust that children have in their father is the only legitimate benchmark of our relationship with them. Time is important as long as that time establishes, strengthens, grows trust. Fathers, do our children trust us? Do they open up their hearts to us? Because the challenge for fathers is to build trust. Let's go to Eph 6 again.
<p><font color= "blue">
And you, fathers, do not provoke your children to wrath, but bring them up in the training and the admonition of the Lord. (Eph:6:4)</font><br>
Fathers, do not irritate and provoke your children to anger, do not exasperate them to resentment, but rear them tenderly in the training and discipline and counsel and admonition of the Lord. That requires that we value our children as God values them. </p>
<p>
We could also have turned to Psa 127:3 to reinforce that. Are we, then, consistent in our training and our nurturing of our children – in our discipling of our children? Turning hearts involves establishing trust, accepting our God-given responsibilities as fathers, establishing relationships built on trust heart to heart, accepting our father's mandate will only happen when we pro-actively turn our heart to our children. Raising Godly offspring must begin with the husband and wife relationship that expands, then, to include children made in the image and the likeness of God. They are born with a clean heart and that heart must be filled with the moral imperatives that define God, that define His love, that then becomes the moral guide for their life – and then their responsibility is to pass it on to their children, raising image-bearers from generation to generation.</p>
<p>
Fathers must also accept the father's mandate to be genuine fathers whose hearts are pro-actively turned to their children developing relationships that are established on trust from heart to heart because the challenges for parenting today are enormous. The pressure to compromise and become pseudo parents is everywhere. Brethren, this world model is flawed and we cannot afford to be misled and influenced by it. </p>
<p>
Raising Godly offspring requires parents – dads and moms – you and me. <br>In fact, it requires a whole church, it requires a whole congregation because one of the things that I value as being a part of the church, being a part of a group of people who all value the same thing, who all value and seek to uphold God's law within the limitations that each of us bring to them, is that when I bring my children to church, all share the same values. You can demonstrate for my children those same values and I really appreciate it when you do and when you do it for other people's children. It is very important that we do that as a whole congregation. You are all involved in it. You know the expression, 'It takes a village to raise a child'. You set a positive example for my children and I thank you for it.</p>
<p>
So, raising Godly offspring requires parents who view parenting as the opportunity to invest themselves fully in the life of the child who will someday become an irresistible manifestation of God's grace – Godly offspring. <br>That's our motivation for bearing and raising children. It's also our challenge.</p>
