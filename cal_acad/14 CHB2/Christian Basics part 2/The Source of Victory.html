The Source of Victory

<h3>
Allow God to give you Peace and Rest
</h3>
<p>
Jesus said, <font color= "blue">Come to Me, all you who labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light (Matt 11:28-30)</font>.</p>
<p>
That sounds good, doesn't it? I've had enough heavy stuff in my life, and I want to be free. It's nice to know that we don't have to figure everything out.<br> We need to get comfortable with saying, "I don't have a clue, but I'm not going to worry about it because God's in control. I'm going to live free and light!" When we're overloaded with the cares of this life—struggling, labouring and worrying—we need some help. Our minds need to rest from worrying about how to take care of problems, our emotions need to rest from being upset all the time, and our wills need a rest from stubbornness and rebellion.<br> So we need to be humble enough to call out to God and say, "I need help!"<br> Your beginning doesn't have to dictate your ending. Get God involved in every area of your life and allow Him to lead you into rest.</p>
<h3> 
Worry or Worship?
</h3>
<p>
Worry and worship are exact opposites, and we'd all be much happier if we learned to become worshippers instead of worriers. Worry opens the door for the devil, but worship is reverence and adoration for God that leads us into His presence. God created us to worship Him, and I don't believe we can walk in victory if we don't become worshippers. Sometimes when we don't have what we need or want, the enemy tries to discourage us and keep us from worshipping God. But when we know that God has our best interests at heart, we can worship Him regardless of our circumstances. Remember, God is good even when our circumstances are not! God doesn't always give us our heart's desire right away. He wants us to develop a deep, personal relationship with Him and an outrageous love for Him so much so that we can't live without it. This kind of relationship and love brings the worshipful attitude that God wants us to have. </p>
<p>
To worship means "to reverence," or "to defer to." We are to have reverential fear and awe of God. We are to respect and honour Him, and defer to Him by submitting to and obeying Him, and adapt ourselves to His will. <br>We must realise that Christ, living in us, has come to lead and guide us into a special lifestyle of worship and victorious living. <br>When Satan throws worry on you, I challenge you to stop what you're doing, get down on your knees before God, and begin praising Him.<br> Worship is a spiritual weapon, a warhead or bomb you can use against the enemy. Your prayers and worship will get you heavenly help, and you won't have to fight your own battles. God's grace and power can make things happen with ease that you can't bring about no matter how much you struggle.</p>
<p> 
So stop worrying about everything, give it to God, and live in grace. <br>Grace isn't just divine favour—it's power! Don't waste another day of your life worrying. Determine what your responsibility is and what it is not.<br> Don't try to take on God's responsibility. When we do what we can do, God steps in and does what we can't. So give yourself and your worries to God and begin enjoying the abundant life He has planned for you. </p>
