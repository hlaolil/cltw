   <h1>
Love 
</h1>
<p>
What makes the New Testament new is the appearance of the Son of God on the scene of human history. In Jesus Christ we see as never before a revelation of God. As He said, <font color= "blue">“He who has seen Me has seen the Father;” <br>(John 14:9; cf. Col 2:9; Heb 1:3)</font>.<br> For in a real sense, Jesus was God. (John 1:1; 20:28).</p>
<p>
But the coming of Christ not only brings about the revelation of God. By His death and resurrection Christ also brings about the salvation of men <br>(Rom 5:6-11).<br> This salvation includes forgiveness of sins (Eph 1:7), access to God (Eph 2:18), the hope of eternal life (John 3:16), and a new heart which is inclined to do good deeds (Eph 2:10; Titus 2:14).</p>
<p>
Therefore, when dealing with love, we must try to relate everything to Jesus Christ and His life, death and resurrection. In the life and death of Christ we see in a new way what God’s love is and what man’s love for God and for others should be. And through faith, the Spirit of Christ, living in us enables us to follow His example.</p>
<h3>
God’s Love for His Son
</h3>
<p>
In the Old Testament we saw that God loves His own glory and delights to display it in creation and redemption. A deeper dimension of this self-love becomes clear in the New Testament. <br>It is still true that God aims in all His works to display His glory for men to enjoy and praise (Eph 1:6, 12, 14; John 17:4). But what we learn now is that Christ <font color= "blue">“who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person” (Heb 1:3)</font>.<br>
<font color= "blue">“in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily;” (Col 2:9).</font><br> In short, Christ is God and has eternally existed in a mysterious union with His Father (John 1:1). Therefore, God’s self-love, or His love for His own glory, can now be seen as a love for <font color= "blue">“the glory of Christ, who is the image of God”<br> (2 Cor 4:4; cf. Phil 2:6).</font> The love that God the Father has for the Son is expressed often in the Gospel of John (3:35; 5:20; 10:17; 15:9, 10; 17:23-26) and occasionally elsewhere (Matt 3:17; 12:18; 17:5; Eph 1:6; Col 1:13). </p>
<p>
This love within the Trinity itself is important for Christians for two reasons: </p>
<p>
First, the costly beauty of the incarnation and death of Christ cannot be understood without it.</p>
<p>
Second, it is the very love of the Father for the Son which the Father pours into the hearts of believers (John 17:26). </p>
<p>
The ultimate hope of the Christian is to see the glory of God in Christ<br> (John 17:5),</p> 
<p>
to be with Him (John 14:24)</p> 
<p>
and to delight in Him as much as His Father does (John 17:26).</p>
<h3>
God’s Love for Men
</h3>
<p>
In Rom 8 Paul said, <font color= "blue">“Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?” (Rom 8:35)</font> Again in Rom 8 he says, <font color= "blue">“nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Rom 8:39)</font><br> This change from “Christ” to “God in Christ” shows that under the heading “God’s love for men” we must include Christ’s love for men, since His love is an extension of God’s.</p>
<p>
The most basic thing that can be said about love in relation to God is that <br><font color= "blue">“God is love” (1 John 4:8, 16; cf. 2 Cor 13:11).</font> This does not mean that God is an old-fashioned name for the ideal of love. It suggests, rather, that one of the best words to describe God’s character is love. God’s nature is such that in His fullness He needs nothing (Acts 17:25) but rather overflows in goodness. <br>It is His nature to love.</p>
<p>
Because of this divine love, God sent His only Son into the world so that by Christ’s death for sin (1 Cor 15:3; 1 Peter 2:24; 3:18) all those who believe might have eternal life (John 3:16; 2 Thess 2:16; 1 John 3:1; Titus 3:4).<br><font color= "blue"> “In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.” (1 John 4:10)</font>. Indeed, it is precisely God’s wrath from which believers are saved by faith in the death and resurrection of Christ (Rom 5:9). But we must not imagine that Christ is loving while God is angry. <font color= "blue">“But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” (Rom 5:8)</font>. <br>It is God’s own love which finds a way to save us from his own wrath <font color= "blue">(by grace you have been saved) (Eph 2:3-5).</font></p>
<p>
Nor should we think of the Father forcing the Son to die for man. <br>The repeated message of the New Testament is that <font color= "blue">“Christ also has loved us and given Himself for us,” (Gal 2:2; Eph 5:2; 1 John 3:16).</font> <br><font color= "blue">“Having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end” <br>(John 13:1; 15:9,12-13)</font>. <br>And the love of the risen Christ guides (2 Cor 5:14), sustains (Rom 8:35) and reproves (Rev 3:19) His people still. </p>
<p>
Another misconception that must be avoided is that the love of God and Christ can be merited or earned by anyone. Jesus was accused of being a friend of tax collectors and sinners (Matt 11:9; Luke 7:34). The answer He gave was, <font color= "blue">“Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick” (Mark 2:17)</font>. At another time when Jesus was accused of eating with tax collectors and sinners (Luke 15:1, 2) He told three parables of how it gladdens the heart of God when one sinner repents (Luke 5:3-32).<br> In this way, Jesus showed that His saving love aimed to embrace not those who thought they were righteous (Luke 18:9) but rather the poor in spirit (Matt 5:3) like the tax collector who said, <font color= "blue">“God be merciful to me a sinner” (Luke 18:13)</font>. The love of Jesus could not be earned; it could only be freely accepted and enjoyed.<br> Unlike the legalism of the Pharisees, <font color= "blue">"My yoke is easy and My burden is light.”</font> (Matt 11:30).</p>
<p>
The reason Jesus demonstrated a love for those who could not merit His favour is that He was like His Father. He taught that God <font color= "blue">“makes the sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust” (Matt 5:45)</font>, <font color= "blue">“he is kind to the grateful and to the selfish” (Luke 6:35)</font>. <br>Paul too stresses that the unique thing about divine love is that it seeks to save even enemies. He describes it like this: <br><font color= "blue">“For when we were still without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die. But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us” (Rom 5:6-8)</font>.</p>
<p>
While it is true that God in one sense loves the whole world in that He sustains the world (Acts 14:17; 17:25; Matt 5:45) and has made a way of salvation for any who will believe, nevertheless, He does not love all men in the same way. He has chosen some before the foundation of the world to be His sons<br> (Eph 1:5) and predestined them for glory (Rom 8:29-30;9:11,23;11:7,28; <br>1 Peter 1:2).<br> God has set His love on these chosen ones in a unique way (Col 3:12;<br> Rom 11:28; 1:7; 1 Thess 1:4; Jude 1) so that their salvation is sure.<br> These He draws to Christ (John 6:44,65) and makes alive (Eph 2:4-5); others He leaves in the hardness of their sinful heart (Rom 11:7; Matt 11:25, 26;<br> Mark 4:11, 12).</p>
<p>
There is a mystery in God’s electing love. Why He chooses one and not another is not revealed. We are only told that it is not due to any merit or human distinctive (Rom 9:10-13). <br>Therefore, all boasting is excluded (Rom 3:27; 11:18, 20, 25; Eph 2:8; <br>Phil 2:12, 13), it is a gift of God from start to finish (John 6:65).<br> We deserved nothing since we were all sinners, and everything we have is due to God who has mercy (Rom 9:16).</p>
<p>
The way one finds oneself within this saving love of God is by faith in the promise that <font color= "blue">“whoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved” <br>(Rom 10:13)</font>. Then Jude 21 says, <font color= "blue">“Keep yourself in the love of God”</font> and<br>Rom 11:22 says, <font color= "blue">“Continue in God’s kindness.”</font> It is clear from Rom 11:20-22 that this means keep on trusting God:<font color= "blue"> “You stand fast only through faith.”</font><br> So one never earns God’s saving love; one remains within it only by trusting in the loving promises of God. This is true even when Jesus says that the reason God loves His disciples is because they keep His word (John 14:23), for the essence of Jesus’ word is a call to live by faith (John 16:27; 20:31).</p>
<h3>
Man’s Love for God and Christ
</h3>
<p>
Jesus sums up the whole Old Testament in the commandments to love God with all your heart and soul and mind and to love your neighbour as yourself <br>(Matt 22:37-40). <br>The failure to love God like this characterised many of the religious leaders of Jesus’ day (Luke 11:42). Jesus said this was the reason they did not love and accept Him (John 5:42; 8:42). He and the Father are one (John 10:30), so that loving one with all the heart involves loving the other, too.</p> 
<p>
Since the “greatest commandment” is to love God, it is not surprising that very great benefits are promised to those who do. <br><font color= "blue">“All things work together for good for those who love God” (Rom 8:28).</font><br> <font color= "blue">“No eye has seen nor ear heard ... what God has prepared for those who love Him” (1 Cor 2:9; cf. Eph 6:24).</font><br><font color= "blue"> “If one loves God, he is known by God” (1 Cor 8:3).</font><br> <font color= "blue">“God has promised a crown of life to those who love Him” <br>(James 1:12; 3:5; cf. 2 Tim 4:8).</font><br> But on the other side there are grave warnings to those who do not love God <br>(2 Tim 2:14; 1 John 2:15-17) and Christ (1 Cor 16:22; Matt 10:37-39).</p>
<p>
Now the question arises: If the same benefits depend on loving God and Christ which at the same time depend on faith, what is the relationship between loving God and trusting Him? We need to recall that love for God, unlike love for a needy neighbour, is not a longing to supply some lack on His part by our service (Acts 17:5). <br>Rather, love for God is a deep adoration for His moral beauty and His complete fullness and sufficiency. It is delighting in Him and a desire to know Him and be with Him. But in order to delight in God, one must have some conviction that He is good, and some assurance that our future with Him will be a happy one. <br>That is, one must have the kind of faith described in Heb 11:<br><font color= "blue"> “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” (Heb 11:1)</font> Therefore, faith precedes and enables our love for God. <br>Confidence in God’s promise grounds our delight in His goodness.</p>
<p>
There is another way to conceive of loving God: not just delighting in who He is and what He promises, but wanting to please Him. Is there a place for this love in the life of the believer?<br> Indeed, there is (John 8:29; Rom 8:8; 1 Cor 7:32; 2 Cor 5:9; Gala 1:10; <br>1 Thess 4:1); however, we must guard very closely here against dishonouring God by presuming to become His benefactors.<br> Heb 11 shows us the way: <font color= "blue">“without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.” (Heb 11:6)</font> <br>Here the faith which pleases God has two convictions: that God exists and that to find Him is to be greatly rewarded. </p>
<p>
Therefore, in order to love God in the sense of pleasing Him, we must never approach Him because we want to reward Him, but only because He rewards us. In short, we become the source of God’s pleasure to the extent that He is the source of ours. We can do Him a favour only by happily accepting all His favours. We best express our love for Him when we live not presumptuously, as God’s benefactors, but humbly and happily as the beneficiaries of His mercy. The person who lives this way will inevitably keep the commandments of Jesus (John 14:15) and of God (1 John 5:3).</p>
<h3>
Man’s Love for Man
</h3>
<p>
Jesus’ second commandment was,<font color= "blue"> “You shall love your neighbour as yourself" (Matt 22:39; Mark 12:31,33; Luke 10:27).</font><br> The best interpretations of it in Jesus’ own words are the Golden Rule:<br>
<font color= "blue">“And just as you want men to do to you, you also do to them likewise.”<br> (Luke 6:31)</font> and the parable of the good Samaritan (Luke 10:29-37).<br> It means that we should seek the good of others as earnestly as we desire good to come our way.<br> This is the most frequently cited Old Testament commandment in the New Testament (Matt 19:19; Rom 13:9; Gal 5:28; James 2;8).</p>
<p>
After this commandment, probably the most famous passage on love in the New Testament is 1 Cor 13. Here Paul shows that there can be religiosity and humanitarianism without love.<font color= "blue"> “And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, but have not love, it profits me nothing” (1 Cor 13:3).</font> <br>This raises the question of what this love is if one could sacrifice his life and still not have it.</p>
<p>
The New Testament answer is that the kind of love Paul is talking about must spring from a motivation which takes into account the love of God in Christ. Genuine love is born of faith in the loving promises of God.<br> Paul says that <font color= "blue">“whatever is not from faith is sin” (Rom 14:23)</font>. More positively he says, <font color= "blue">“Faith working through love” (Gal 5:6)</font>.<br> Or as John puts it, <font color= "blue">“We have know and believed the love God has for us ... We love Him because He first loved us” (1 John 4:16,19)</font>. Therefore, Christian love exists only where the love of God in Christ is known and trusted. This profound link between faith and love probably accounts for why Paul mentions the two together so often (Eph 1:15; 6:23; Col 1:4; 1 Thess 3:6; 5:8; 2 Thess 1:3; <br>1 Tim 6:11; 2 Tim 1:3; 2:2; Titus 2:2; 3:15; cf. Rev 2:19).</p>
<p>
But why is it that faith always “works through love”? One of the hallmarks of love is that it <font color= "blue">“does not seek its own” (1 Cor 13:5)</font>. It does not manipulate others in order to win their approval or gain some material reward. <br>Rather, it seeks to reward others and build them up (1 Cor 8:1; Rom 14:15;<br> Eph 4:16; Rom 13:10).<br> Love does not use others for its own ends; it delights to be a means to their welfare. If this is the hallmark of love, how can sinful men, who by nature are selfish (Eph 2:3), ever love each other?</p>
<p>
The answer of the New Testament is that we must be born again:<br> <font color= "blue">“everyone who loves is born of God and knows God.” (1 John 4:7)</font>. <br>To be born of God means to become His child with His character and to be transferred from death to life: <font color= "blue">“We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren” (1 John 3:14)</font>. God Himself abides in His children by His Spirit (1 John 3:9; 4:12-13) so that when they love it is because His love is being perfected in them (1 John 3:7,12,16).</p>
<p>
Paul teaches the same thing when he says <font color= "blue">"the fruit of the Spirit is love” <br>(Gal 5:22; Col 1:8; 2 Tim 1:7)</font>, that it is “from God” (Eph 6:23) and is “taught by God,” not men (1 Thess 4:9). The fact that love is enabled only by God is seen in Paul’s prayers also: <font color= "blue">“May the Lord make you increase and abound in love to one another and to all” (1 Thess 3:12; Phil 1:9)</font>.</p>
<p>
Now we are in a position to answer our earlier question: Why does faith always work through love? Faith is the way we receive the Holy Spirit, whose fruit is love. <br>Paul asks, <font color= "blue">“Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?” (Gal 3:2)</font> The answer is clearly faith. This means that the essential characteristic of the person who has been born again and is being led by the Spirit of God is faith (John 1:12, 13). Therefore, while love is a fruit of the Spirit, it is also a fruit of faith, since it is by faith that the Spirit works (Gal 3:5).</p>
<p>
To understand fully the dynamics of this process, another factor must be brought in: the factor of hope. Faith and hope cannot be separated.<br> Genuine faith in Christ implies a firm confidence that our future is secure <br>(Heb 11:1, Rom 15:13). This essential oneness of faith and hope helps us grasp why faith always “works through love.” <br>The person who has confidence that God is working all things together for his good (Rom 8:28) can relax and entrust his life to a faithful Creator <br>(1 Peter 4:19). He is free from anxiety and fear (1 Peter 5:7; Phil 4:6). <br>So he is not easily irritated (1 Cor 13:5). Rather, he is freed from self-justifying, self-protecting concerns and becomes a person who<font color= "blue"> “looks out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others” (Phil 2:4)</font>. Being satisfied in God’s presence and promise, he is not bent on selfishly seeking his own pleasure, but rather <font color= "blue">“Let each of us please his neighbour for his good, leading to edification” (Rom 15:1-2).</font></p>
<p>
In other words, having our hope pinned on the promises of God frees us from the attitudes that hinder self-giving love.<br> Therefore, Paul said that if there were no Resurrection hope, <font color= "blue">“Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die” (1 Cor 15:32</font>). If God has not satisfied our deep longing for life, then we may as well try to get as much earthly pleasure as possible, whether it is loving to others or not. But God has in fact given us a satisfying and confident hope as a basis for a life of love. Therefore in Col 1, hope is the ground of love: <font color= "blue">“We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ ... since we heard of your faith ... your love for all the saints, because of the hope laid up for you in Heaven.” (Col 1:3-5) </font></p>
<p>
Thus, we conclude that faith, when understood as a deep contentment in the promises of God, always works through love. Therefore, the way to become a loving person is to set our hope more fully on God and delight more fully in the confidence that whatever is encountered on the path of obedience is for our good.</p>
<p>
The love that is born of faith and the Spirit is especially manifest in the Christian home and in the community of believers. <br>It transforms husband-wife relationships on the pattern of Christ’s love <br>(Eph 5:25, 28, 33; Col 3:19; Titus 2:4). <br>It is the fibre in the Christian community<font color= "blue"> "which is the bond of perfection.” <br>(Col 3:14; 2:2; Phil 2:2; 1 Peter 3:8).</font> It enables the members to <font color= "blue">“walk worthy of the calling with which you were called, with all lowliness and gentleness, with long suffering, bearing with one another" (Eph 4:2; 1 Cor 13:7).</font> But more importantly it is the force behind positive deeds of spiritual edification (Rom 14:15; 1 Cor 8:1; Eph 4:16) and the meeting of material needs (Luke 10:27-37; Rom 12:13; Gal 5:13; 1 Thessalonians 1:3; 1 Tim 3:2; Titus 1:8; Heb 13:1-3; James 1:27; 2:16; 1 Peter 4:9; 1 John 3:17, 18).</p>
<p>
Love is not to be—cannot be—restricted to friends.<br> Jesus said, <font color= "blue">“You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbour and hate your enemy. But I say to you: Love your enemies and pray for those who curse you” (Matt 5:43-44; Luke 6:27)</font>. <br>This same concern was carried into the early church in verses like Rom 12:14, 19-21; 1 Cor 4:12; Gal 6:10; 1 Thess 3:12; 5:15; 1 Peter 3:9.<br>The great desire of the Christian in doing good to his enemy and praying for him is that the enemy might cease to be an enemy and come to glorify God <br>(1 Peter 2:12; 3:14-16; Titus 2:8, 10).</p>
<p>
Toward friend and foe, love is the attitude that governs the Christian in <font color= "blue">“all that you do” (1 Cor 16:14)</font>. It is <font color= "blue">"a more excellent way" of life (1 Cor 12:31)</font>. <br>And since it does not wrong anyone, but seeks the good of all, it fulfils the whole law of God (Rom 13:19; Matt 7:12, 22:40; Gal 5:14; James 2:8; compare Rom 8:4 and Gal 5:22).<br> But it is not automatic; it can cool away (Matt 22:12; Rev 2:4). Therefore, Christians must make it their aim (1 Tim 1:15) to <font color= "blue">“consider one another in order to stir up love and good works” (Heb 10:24)</font>. We must pray for God to cause our love to abound more and more (Phil 1:9; 1 Thess 3:12, 13).</p>
<p>
We must concentrate on the examples of love in Christ (John 13:34; 15:12, 17; Eph 5:2; 1 John 3:23; 2 John 5) and in His saints (1 Cor 4:12, 15-17; <br>1 Tim 4:12; 2 Tim 1:13; 3:10). In this way, we will make our call and election sure (2 Peter 1:7,10) and bear a compelling witness in the world to the truth of the Christian faith (John 13:34,35; 1 Peter 2:12).</p>
<h3>
Man’s Love for Things
</h3>
<p>
On the one hand, the New Testament teaches that the things God has created are good and should be enjoyed with thanksgiving (1 Tim 4:3; 6:17).<br> But on the other hand, it warns against loving them in such a way that our affections are drawn away from God.<br>

The great danger is that the love of money (Matt 6:24; Luke 16:14; 1 Tim 6:10; 2 Tim 3:2; 2 Peter 2:15) and earthly pleasures (2 Tim 3:4) and human acclaim (Matt 6:5; 23:6; Luke 11:43; 3 John 9) will steal our hearts from God and make us insensitive to His higher purposes for us.<br> John says, <font color= "blue">“If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him” <br>(1 John 2:15-17)</font>.<br>And James echoes this: <font color= "blue">“Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God?” (James 4:4; cf. 2 Tim 4:10)</font><br> The “world” is not any particular class of objects or people. It is anything which lays a claim on our affections to be loved other than for Jesus’ sake.
