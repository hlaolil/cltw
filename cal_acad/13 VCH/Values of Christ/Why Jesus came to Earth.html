Why Jesus came to Earth
</h1>
<h3>
Reconciliation
</h3>
<p>
Jesus forever changed the way God relates to mankind.<br> Yes, there are scriptural examples of God’s catastrophic judgement on sin.<br> But God’s greatest act of judgement was when He placed all of His wrath for our sins upon Jesus. This forever satisfied God’s wrath. Since that time, God hasn’t been judging our sins (2 Cor 5:19). God’s not angry at us. He’s not even in a bad mood.</p>
<p>
Look at the angels’ joy at the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem.<br>
<font color= "blue">“And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying: “Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill toward men!” (Luke 2:13-14)</font><br>
This scripture is very familiar to us, yet there is a lot of misunderstanding about what it’s saying. Some translations say they were proclaiming “good will among men” or “peace to men of good will.” Basically, this passage has been interpreted to say Jesus was bringing peace on earth among people.<br> That’s not why these angels were praising God. If that interpretation were true, then Jesus’ own words would contradict this. He said,<br><font color= "blue">
“Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword. For I have come to set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and a man’s enemies will be those of his own household.” (Matt 10:34-36)</font><br>
Jesus Himself said He was not sent to bring peace on the earth among people. The peace that the angels of Luke 2:13-14 were praising God for was peace between GOD and Man. They were announcing the end of God’s war on sin. Peace now reigns between God and man.</p>
<p>
Prior to Jesus’ coming, there was wrath from God against mankind for his sins. It wasn’t total wrath. Even in the Old Testament, we see God’s mercy and grace. Yet the Old Testament Law was a ministry of wrath (Romans 4:15 with <br>2 Cor 3:7,9), and people’s sins were held against them.<br> But when Jesus came, God stopped holding people’s sins against them. This is exactly what 2 Cor 5 says:<br><font color= "blue">
“that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation.” <br>(2 Cor 5:19,21)</font><br>

The word “reconciliation” is talking about making peace. God was no longer holding us accountable. Instead, He imputed our sins to Jesus, making Jesus accountable for our sins. Jesus became what we were so we could become what He was—the righteousness of God.</p>
<h3>
Jesus became our Judgement for Sin
</h3>
<p>
Jesus was like a lightning rod that drew all the judgement of God onto Himself. He not only bore our sins; He actually became sin (2 Cor 5:21).</p><p><font color= "blue">

“Now My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save Me from this hour? But for this purpose I came to this hour. Father, glorify Your name.” Then a voice came from heaven, saying, “I have both glorified it and will glorify it again.” Therefore the people who stood by and heard it said that it had thundered. Others said, “An angel has spoken to Him.” Jesus answered and said, “This voice did not come because of Me, but for your sake. Now is the judgement of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out. And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all <i>peoples</i> to Myself.” (John 12:27-32)</font></p>
<p>
Many have thought this thirty-second passage means that if God is properly glorified in our preaching, then He will draw all people unto Himself. But that is not what this passage is saying.

Notice that the word <i>“peoples”</i> in verse 32 is italicised. That means it wasn’t in the original language. The translators put this word in italics to let you know this was their addition, but it wasn’t a part of the text. If you take this verse in context, I believe that the Lord was saying He would draw all JUDGMENT to Himself. Jesus, like a lightning rod, attracted all of God’s judgement for all of mankind’s sins for all time onto Himself.</p>
<p>
All the murder, all the perversion, every vile and rotten sin imaginable, all sickness, and all disease ever known to mankind actually entered into His physical human body. Isaiah 52:14 talks about the crucifixion of Jesus and says that He was marred more than any man to the point that He was unrecognisable as a human being.<br>

That could not just happen from physical beatings, especially since the Word says that not a single bone was broken in His body (Ps. 34:20 with John 19:36). I believe His body was completely disfigured from the cancers, tumours, diseases, deformities, and anything else human beings have ever suffered.</p>
<p>
Jesus didn’t ask for the cup to be taken from Him just because of the physical pain He would suffer but because He did not want to become sin. He hated becoming what He came to redeem us from. And the worst part of all Jesus’ sufferings was total rejection from His Father.<br>
<font color= "blue">
“And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?” that is, “My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?” (Matt 27:46)</font><br>

God the Father forsook Jesus so you and I would never be forsaken. All that you and I would have suffered, through billions of years in eternity—the grief, the pain and, worst of all, the complete separation from the presence of God—Jesus experienced. And He experienced all of this for us. When we say God is judging our sins as individuals or corporately as a nation, we are voiding what Jesus did. That would be “double jeopardy.” i.e. punishment twice for the same offence</p>
<p>
Some of you may not like this, but it’s true. Sin isn’t a problem with God any more. It’s the church that has made it a major deal. Neither past, present, nor future sins can separate you from God.The only people who will go to hell are those who have spurned and rejected the greatest sacrifice that has ever been made. In heaven, you won’t answer for your sin; Jesus already has. You will answer for your acceptance or rejection of Jesus.<br>

You might now be thinking that you’re just giving people a license to sin.<br> Well, it seems to me that people are doing a pretty good job of that without a license. What I’m saying doesn't free you to sin; it will free you from the condemnation and the guilt that comes when you do sin.</p>
<p>
To continue in sin is just stupid. You’ll be opening the door for Satan to have an inroad into your life (Rom. 6:16). If you do, then you will suffer the natural consequences of sin, but it will not be because of the judgement of God.<br>If you commit adultery, you will probably lose your family, but it was you who caused it, not God.</p>
