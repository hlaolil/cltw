Blessed Peacemakers
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God. (Matt 5:9)</font></p>
<p>A common misunderstanding of the seventh beatitude is the notion that it says, “Blessed are the peace-lovers ...” Some there are who love peace so much they go along to get along, refuse to make waves, settle for peace at any price, evade the issues. To have peace they become appeasers.<br> But Jesus warned, <font color= "blue">“Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword.” (Matt 10:34)</font>.<br> So we are to be more than peace lovers. We’re called to peacemaking.</p>
<p>Saint Augustine defined peace as “the tranquillity of order.” It is the absence of things hurtful, the presence of things helpful. And it is not something we only strive to do for house plants, it is something we do for people.<br>
Historically, this beatitude has been understood several ways.</p>
<p>
The early fathers believed it meant making peace within their own souls.<br>Each of us is a veritable civil war walking around battling within such foes as anger, bitterness, worry, jealousy, doubts, hate and other unsettling passions. Being a peacemaker means starting with yourself. So many of our early fathers of the faith joined a monastery and in a life of quiet reflection built peace.<br> <font color= "blue">“The peace of God, which passes all understanding, will keep your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus” (Phil 4:7)</font></p>
<p>Others believe peacemaking is spiritual peace best achieved through evangelism.<br>Paul says, <font color= "blue">“Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,” (Rom 5:1)</font></p>
<p>
C. S. Lewis observed, “Man is not only a sinner who needs to be saved, he is a rebel who needs to lay down his arms.” You see, the entire human race is at war with God and we shall certainly be brought to bay and held accountable for our sinful deeds by an almighty, holy God.</p>
<p>
Peacemaking then can be proclaiming the reconciliation and mercy God holds out in Jesus Christ. It is calling people to repentance and faith and a life of loving fellowship with God. This is spiritual peacemaking.

Still others understand being a peacemaker as creating sociological peace. It is working to make the world a better place, to establish justice, to cause quarrelling to cease, to right wrongs, to establish right relationships with people.</p>
<p>So will the real peacemaker please stand up? Is he spiritual? Sociological?<br> Or psychological, sociological, political, ecological, or spiritual. <br>Paul wrote, <font color= "blue">“ Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be preserved ...” (1 Thess 5:23)</font><br> See here how God cares for the whole person?</p>
<p>Jesus said the outcome of His grace working within us is not hostility, jealousy and injury. It is peacemaking. The stamp of divinity is to help bring the sinful chaos of life within and without into the tranquillity of divine order.</p>
<p>
My, but how the world tries to make peace! We’ve got the United Nations, numerous treaties and non-aggression pacts. It seems like there is always a peace conference going on. But two problems chronically arise: first, too much talk and too little action; and second, we leave God out of the peace.<br> And it is forever true that we cannot achieve the brotherhood of man without the fatherhood of God.</p>
<p>
Paul points out that peace is a fruit of God’s indwelling Spirit (Gal 5:22). <br>It is the result of following Christ. It is neither self-generated nor politically conjured.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Conclusion</font></p>
<p>
As we conclude, be aware of the reward for peacemaking. “Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of God.”<br>

In the Greek “called” means “owned.” God “owns” the peacemaker as His very son. “This is My beloved Son in whom I am well pleased!”<br>

“Sons of God” is a Jewish manner of speech.<br> In Acts, Barnabas is called a “son of encouragement.” It is a Hebraic way of saying Barnabas was an encouraging man.<br> Likewise, Jesus is the “Son of man,” or fully human, incarnate. <br>So in the text to be a “son of God” means to be doing a Godlike work.</p>
<p>
What does the seventh beatitude mean? “Blessed ... fulfilled ... doing what God created you to do ... blissful is the man who is a peacemaker, who brings people together ... Happy is the man who creates a nourishing atmosphere that leads to spiritual, psychological, and social peace. He shall be owned by God for he is doing a Godlike work.”
