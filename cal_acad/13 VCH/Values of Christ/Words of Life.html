   <h1>
Words of Life
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
"It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words 

that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life." (John 

6:63)</font></p>
<p>
Some people use the above verse to claim that Jesus did not really mean<br> 

(in John 6:27-58) that we must actually eat His flesh and drink His 

blood.<br> They say, "See, it is the Spirit that is important; the flesh 

doesn't help at all. Jesus doesn't think that we are saved by matter. 

What is important is that we have faith and believe in Him. He even says 

here that His words are Spirit and Life. That's what we should "eat", 

His words. He doesn't mean that we need to eat His Body and drink His 

Blood in order to have eternal life, but simply to believe the words 

that He said, and believe in Him. This verse shows, they argue, that 

eating His Body and drinking His blood just means that we are to believe 

His words, by the work of His Spirit in our hearts. We are saved by 

faith alone, not by matter."</p>
<p>
But this is a misunderstanding of John 6:63. In order to understand John 

6:63 rightly, we have to keep John 6:26 in mind.<br> That verse says, "Jesus 

answered them and said, <font color= "blue">“Most assuredly, I say to you, you seek Me, not 

because you saw the signs, but because you ate of the loaves and were 

filled." (John 6:26 )</font><br> The people were seeking Jesus because of the flesh, not 

the Spirit. That is, they wanted their bellies filled with more bread 

and fish. In John 6:63 Jesus is not saying that His flesh profits 

nothing. That would directly contradict everything He just said. He is 

saying that being led by our flesh [i.e. our bellies, the fleshly 

desires for the temporal things of this world] profits nothing. We 

cannot find true life that way. <br>That is what Jesus had said to 

Nicodemus, <font color= "blue">"That which is born of the flesh is 

flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit." (John 

3:6)</font><br> True life comes by the work of the Holy Spirit, who opens 

our eyes and hearts to the things of the Spirit. The same sense of the 

term 'flesh' is used , where Jesus says, <font color= "blue">"You judge 

according to the flesh; I judge no one." (John 8:15)</font><p>
<p>
We see this distinction [between what is of the flesh, and what is of 

the Spirit] even among the Twelve, in John 6:66-71, where John contrasts 

Peter and Judas. (Recall that Matthew tells us that Jesus said to Peter, 

<font color= "blue">"Flesh and blood has not revealed this to you" - Matt 16:17.)</font><br> We also 

see this same distinction in John 6:36-40, where Jesus is contrasting 

those who are given to Him by the Father with those who do not have 

faith. Those who do not have faith are still "in the flesh". We see this 

distinction again in John 6:44. Jesus is contrasting those who have 

faith, and believe in Him, with those who have the old covenant but do 

not have faith in Christ, who fulfils the old covenant.</p>
<p>
So there are two distinct points being made here in this part of John 6.<br> 

One is that if a person is merely in the flesh, and has not been given 

new life by the Spirit so as to believe in Christ, he cannot understand 

the things of the Spirit. <br>The second point is that Christ Himself is the 

Bread of Life, such that if any man eats His flesh and drinks His blood, 

that man has eternal life. But that second point is only open 

[epistemically] to people who are not "in the flesh", that is, those who 

are not just following their carnal appetites, void of the Spirit. <br>

Unless a man is born again by the Spirit, what Christ says about Himself 

being the Bread of Life and people eating His flesh and drinking His 

blood becomes a stumbling block. (John 6:61) But if the Spirit quickens 

a man in his spirit, then he does not stumble over the "difficult 

statement" Jesus has given earlier in the chapter about "eating my flesh 

and drinking my blood".</p>
<p>
Paul writes,
<font color= "blue">
"For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things 

of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of 

the Spirit." (Rom 8:5)</font><br>

And then he writes, <font color= "blue">"Now if anyone does not have the 

Spirit of Christ, he is not His." (Rom 8:9)</font> 

In fact, the first part of Rom 8 is all about this distinction. <br>

Similarly, in 1 Cor 2, Paul writes,
<font color= "blue">
"But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, 

for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are 

spiritually discerned." (1 Cor 2:14)</font><br>

That is the idea that Jesus is communicating in the first part of John 

6:63. <br>He is not saying that His own flesh and blood does not give Life. 

He is saying that the Spirit opens a man to understand by faith how, 

what Jesus has been saying about eating His flesh and drinking His 

blood, it is possible in the holy sacrament of the Eucharist. It makes 

no sense to the man without the Spirit, and is thus a cause of stumbling 

to those who do not see with the eyes of faith, given by the Spirit.

In John 6:62, He is saying, If you are already stumbling over My telling 

you that you have to eat My flesh and drink My blood, then how will you 

make sense of that when you see Me ascend into heaven?</p> <p>His disciples, 

apparently, had been thinking that Jesus would cut Himself up into 

pieces, and give pieces of His body to them to eat. But they were still 

thinking carnally, not understanding that Jesus was not talking about 

cutting off pieces of His body, but rather about giving His body and 

blood to them sacramentally in the Eucharist, which He had yet to 

institute on the night in which He was betrayed.</p>
<p>
In the second half of John 6:63, when Jesus says, <font color= 

"blue">"The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are 

life."<font>, He is saying both that the meaning of His words is made 

known to us only by the Spirit, and that by abiding in His words (i.e. 

believing and obeying them, i.e. continuing in the Eucharist, and not 

separating ourselves from the Body of Christ) we remain in the Spirit 

and in the Life of Christ.</p>
