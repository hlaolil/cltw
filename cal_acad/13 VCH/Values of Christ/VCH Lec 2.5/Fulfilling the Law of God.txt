Fulfilling the Law of God
</h1>

Then, addressing the multitude, He said: ““Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfil. (Matt 5:17) </font></p>
<p>
(This is to be understood in a twofold manner. Firstly, Jesus, the Instituter of the New Covenant, came to lead men to a perfect observance of the commandments first given by God in the Old Law, and re-impressed on the people by the prophets. Secondly, Jesus fulfilled every type in the Old Law, and every prophecy relating to the Messiahs which the prophets had uttered).</p>

“For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven. (Matt 5:20) </font></p>
<p>
(The Pharisees and Scribes passed among the Jews for being the most exact observers of the law; but now Jesus said that, if any wished to enter the kingdom of heaven, their justice must be of a much more perfect kind than that of the Scribes and Pharisees. And then our Lord proceeded to give examples in what way their observance of the law was to be more perfect).</p>

“You have heard that it was said to those of old (to the people of the Old Testament): You shall not murder, and whoever murders will be in danger of the judgement (He shall be judged by the court of justice of his own district). But I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother, without a cause shall be in danger of the judgement. And whoever says to his brother: "Raca"! (“good for nothing”) shall be in danger of the council (He deserves to be brought before the supreme court at Jerusalem). And whoever  says: "Thou fool!" (or “man rejected by God”). shall be in danger of hell-fire (Hitherto you have regarded only the actual and literal taking of life as punishable, but I say to you that he who merely feels anger in his heart against his fellow-men, sins against them, and is worthy of punishment. He who gives expression to his anger by injurious words, sins still more, and deserves a more severe punishment; but he who really wishes ill to his neighbour, is worthy of the everlasting punishment of hell. God regards our sins against our neighbour as so offensive to Himself, that He will not receive any offering from us, until we have become reconciled to anyone whom we have injured). Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, (i.e. if he complains of having been offended or injured by you);  leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.” (Matt 5:21-24)</font></p>

“Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, ‘You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord. But I say to you, do not swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is God’s throne; nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. Nor shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black. But let your Yes be Yes, and your No, No. For whatever is more than these is from the evil one. (Matt 5:33-37)</font> </p>

“You have heard that it was said, An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. But I tell you not to resist an evil person. But whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also. If anyone wants to sue you and take away your tunic, let him have your cloak also. 41 And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two. Give to him who asks you, and from him who wants to borrow from you do not turn away. (Matt 5:38-42)</font></p>
<p>
<font color= "blue"> “You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbour and hate your enemy. But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more than others? Do not even the tax collectors do so? Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect. (You are to strive to become like God, who is All-Perfect).(Matt 5:43-48)</font></p>
<h3>
What we learn from these things
</h3>
<p>
Jesus is the Divine Lawgiver. By the foregoing words our Lord stood forward as the Lawgiver of the New Testament, speaking with divine authority. He put Himself above Moses and the prophets, who spoke in the name of God, saying: “Thus says the Lord;” for He spoke and commanded in His own name: “I say to you!”

The moral law of Jesus Christ is a perfect law, because it forbids evil thoughts and words as well as evil deeds. It requires not only an outward observance of commandments, but also an inward amendment, sanctification, and elevation of the soul.
<p><font size="+1">
The Fifth Commandment</font></p>
<p>
Our Lord explicitly teaches that the fifth Commandment forbids not merely the actual deed of murder, but every angry thought and injurious word.<br>

Taking an oath is not, according to our Lord’s teaching, sinful in itself, for it is a religious and a sacred act; but its abuse is sinful, and therefore no one ought to take an oath without necessity. Our Lord Himself took an oath before the court of the High Priest, when He asserted that He was the Son of God. Jesus said to him, <font color= "blue">“It is as you said. (Matt 26:64)</font>.</p>
<p>
The command to love our neighbour is applied by Jesus to all men, even to our personal enemies. Our Lord also requires that our love should be of a practical kind.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Christian perfection </font></p>
<p> 
Finally, our Lord requires us to strive ceaselessly after perfection, placing the perfection of God before us as our model.

The Goodness of God. Our Lord draws special attention to this by reminding us that God does good, and sends rain and sunshine on those who offend Him as well as on those who love Him. He supplies sinners with food and drink, and tries to draw their hearts to Him by gratitude for His benefits.
<p><font size="+1">
Application</font></p>
<p>
Do you ever use bad or injurious words? You have heard how severely our Lord condemns such words; therefore do all you can to cure yourself of this hateful habit. If ever any bad word escapes your lips, say an Our Father to ask forgiveness.</p>
