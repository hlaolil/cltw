Then the Pharisees and scribes asked Him, “Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?”
(Mark 7:5)</font></p>
<h3>
The traditions of men
</h3>  
<p>
The Pharisees and scribes met Jesus “head-on” about His neglect of their traditions. He answered and said to them, “Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: "This people honours Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me. And in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men." For laying aside the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men (Mark 7:6-8).  The great evangelist of the past century, Dr. Harry Ironside  once commented: “To the spiritual mind, it is a question of unceasing wonder that men should be so ready to follow and even fearlessly contend for the authority of human traditions, while they are just as ready to ignore the plain teachings of the Word of God.” </p>
<h3>
Hypocrites
</h3>
<p>
Jesus pulled no punches with the Pharisees and scribes.  It is amazing and almost shocking how clearly he answered them, boldly calling them “hypocrites.”  We will see later in Matt 23:1-36 how Jesus at last boldly and publicly assailed the Pharisees and teachers of the Law for their many errors.  We can only wonder how He might also boldly and publicly assail some leaders of Christianity today, who have forsaken the pure and holy Word of God for their own traditions.  Jesus called them “hypocrites.”  No doubt he took the term from the Greek plays of His day. In these plays the participants wore masks and pretended to be someone they were not. They were merely “playing a part” on stage.  We shudder as we wonder how many “play-actors” are prominently displayed today in the realm of Christianity.  We must make sure we are not partners with them.</p>
<h3>
Inner impurities
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
There is nothing that enters a man from outside which can defile him; but the things which come out of him, those are the things that defile a man. (Mark 7:15). </font></p>
<p>
Here Jesus reverses the flow and makes clear that it is the inner impurities that defile a person rather than things on the outside. Barclay says that when this statement was made it was “well-nigh the most revolutionary passage in the New Testament.”  We realise how this statement reaches much farther than to the traditions of the Pharisees.  The statement would eventually touch the Bible’s food laws as Mark will make clear later.</p>
<p>
To explain all this we might say that there are two ways to take down a great tree.  We can just cut it down with a chain saw and watch it fall, smashing all the smaller trees.  Or, we can cut a small ring around it.  Either way, it is just as dead.  In the latter method it takes somewhat longer for its death to be noticed.  In truth, Jesus had cut a ring around all food laws by His statement.</p>
<p>
We can clearly say that Jesus was not at this moment teaching people to disobey the food laws.  Jesus most surely was obeying the food laws (biblical kashrut) Himself at the time.  Had He not done so He would have broken the very law He came to uphold and fulfil.  Proof of this is seen later in a statement made by Peter.  As late as Acts 10:14, this chief apostle could still say, “... I have never eaten anything impure or unclean.”  The kashrut system of clean and unclean foods was a type, pattern, and shadow of the reality that was to come.  Jesus was and is that reality and that truth.  After His death and resurrection these natural shadows of reality would give way to the true light and the true reality.  That truth is that outward things do not defile a person but rather it is inward things that do so.</p>
<h3>
Food laws and the Apostles
</h3>
<p>
After Jesus’ resurrection the food laws became a major issue.  It seemed that Paul had a good understanding of this subject and we see him rebuking Peter about it in Gal 2:11-21.  Some years before the Gospel of Mark was written, Paul also made some very clear teachings to this same Roman church about this subject in Romans 14:1-23.  Paul summarises his Romans teaching by saying, “... I am fully convinced that no food is unclean in itself. But if anyone regards something as unclean, then for him it is unclean” (Rom. 14:14).</p>
