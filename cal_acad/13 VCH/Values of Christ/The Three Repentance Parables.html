   <h1>
The Three Repentance Parables
</h1>
<p>
Luke 15 is the classic chapter on repentance. The three parables that it contains are familiar and much loved. They are, of course, the Parable of the Lost Sheep, the Parable of the Lost Coin, and the Parable of the Lost Son.</p>
<p>
It is a great irony, however, that these three stories are very often misread and misunderstood. This irony is even greater in view of the fact that the text of Luke gives us a clear and unmistakable clue to their meaning.
<h3>
The Parable of the Lost Sheep
</h3>
<p>
The three parables of Luke 15 are introduced by Luke 15:1-3. <br>There we see the Pharisees and scribes complaining that our Lord Jesus <font color= "blue">
"receives sinners and eats with them" (Luke 15:2).</font>
 They are scandalised by the fact that He accepts them into table fellowship with Himself. <br>This no self-respecting Pharisee would condescend to do. In response to their criticism, Jesus proceeds to tell these stories, beginning with the Parable of the Lost Sheep.</p>
<p>
It is clear on the face of this story that the shepherd of this parable owns all one hundred sheep. This is plain in the words, <font color= "blue">"What man of you, having a hundred sheep" (Luke 15:4)</font> and from the words <font color= "blue">"my sheep" Luke 15:6.</font> <br>As was frequent in Palestine, especially in the southern region called the Negev ("the dry"), this shepherd was grazing his flock in territory described as "the wilderness." This sparsely inhabited region contained sufficient vegetation to sustain sheep as their shepherd led them from grazing place to grazing place. Thus, in the parable, the shepherd is feeding his sheep when he notices that one of them has wandered away from his flock.</p>
<p>
Upon making this discovery, he leaves the <font color= "blue">
"ninety-nine in the wilderness and goes after the one which is lost" (Luke 15:4).</font><br>
From the perspective of a Middle Eastern shepherd, this can hardly mean anything other than that he felt the flock was reasonably safe and would stay together.</p>
<p>
After recovering the lost sheep, he places it lovingly <font color= "blue">"on his shoulders" <br>(Luke 15:5)</font> and brings it back to the flock. When the day's grazing is over and <font color= "blue">"he comes home" (Luke 15:6)</font>, he has a party to which he invites <font color= "blue">"his friends and neighbours" (Luke 15:6)</font> so they can share his joy in having <font color= "blue">"found my sheep which was lost" (Luke 15:6)</font>. That this "party" parallels the celebrations staged in the next two parables, goes without saying.<br>

Our Lord's application of this story is crystal clear:<font color= "blue"> "I say to you that likewise there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine just [righteous] persons who need no repentance" (Luke 15:7).</font> <br> The ninety-nine sheep represent people who are "righteous" and who therefore do not need to repent. This is what the text plainly states.</p>
<p>
But this is not how it is interpreted by many who read and/or teach it.<br> Instead, the "ninety-nine just persons who need no repentance" are transformed into "ninety-nine unrighteous persons who only think they need no repentance! That this manifestly contradicts the text and turns it upside down is so clear that this rereading of our Lord's words is self-refuting.</p>
<p>
Plainly stated, the Parable of the Lost Sheep is not about eternal salvation at all. It is about a Christian who wanders away from God's flock and pursues the pathway of sin. His restoration to fellowship with his Saviour and Shepherd, as well as to fellowship with the Lord's people, who have not wandered away, requires repentance. When such a recovery of a straying believer occurs, the Great Shepherd is filled with joy and heaven itself rejoices with Him. <br>And so, of course, should God's people as well.
<h3>
The Parable of the Lost Coin
</h3>
<p>
Once again, it is obvious that the woman of the parable is the person to whom the ten coins belong. One of them becomes lost (Luke 15:8), but just as clearly the other nine do not! The story assumes that the woman knows exactly where they are. She is looking for the one lost coin, not the other nine.</p>
<p>
In order to find it, however, she must "light a lamp" and use a broom to "sweep the house" (Luke 15:8). It is evident that the place where she lives is both dark and dirty, and that she believes the lost coin may be found in some dark nook or cranny where there might be considerable dirt or trash. The parable thus admirably fits the reality that the Christian Church lives in a world which contains more than enough darkness and moral and spiritual filth.<br> (cf. 2 Peter 1:19 "as a light that shines in a dark place").</p>
<p>
Born again Christians do indeed go astray in this world of darkness and filth, but they still retain their identity and value to God just as a lost coin is still valuable no matter how much trash it is buried under. The Church is responsible to recognise, as did the woman in the parable, that the straying Christian still has enormous value and needs to be returned to the company of other believers so that his value and theirs may be properly utilised for God. <br>A Christian church is always "richer" when a straying Christian returns to the fold.</p>
<p>
The recovery of such a Christian is a source of joy to the Church and to its heavenly "friends and neighbours," the angels of God (Luke 15:9-10). That the angels are intimately concerned with what happens in the Christian church is clearly indicated by passages like Eph 3:10; 1 Cor 11:10; Heb 1:14; 12:22­23; and other texts. Indeed, 1 Cor 11:10 in particular implies that the angels observe Christian practices and activities (cf. also Luke 24:6­7). <br>Employing the imagery of the Lord's parable, we might say that whenever the Church gathers the angels are "invited" and in fact attend as unseen guests! So whenever the Church gathers and rejoices over a back slidden believer who has been recovered, it does so "in the presence of the angels" who are there to share that joy (Luke 15:10)!
<p><font size="+1">
Conclusion</font>
<p>
There is nothing at all in either parable about eternal salvation. <br>In fact, Luke 15 as a whole is a celebration of one of the most joyous experiences that a Christian congregation can have--the recovery for God, and for the congregation, of one of God's precious sheep and valued coins.<br> May the Lord grant this joy repeatedly in grace churches all over the world!<br>
The misreading of the parables of Luke 15 as though they applied to the salvation of sinners is very unfortunate. To be sure, it is wonderfully joyful when an unsaved sinner gets saved. But that is not the joy described in these parables about repentance. To be saved, all the unsaved person needs to do is to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ (Acts 16:31)!</p>
<h3>
The Parable of the Two Lost Sons
</h3>
<p>
Luke 15 is the classic New Testament chapter on repentance.<br> Here, if anywhere, we should meet the fundamental teaching on New Testament repentance. As we saw in our study of Luke 15:1-10, the first two parables of the chapter--The Lost Sheep and The Lost Coin--very clearly refer to the repentance of a born-again person who has wandered away from God's flock and become "lost" in the sense of being out of touch with the Lord and His people.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
A Son before he Repented</font>
<p>
But if this is evident in the first two parables, it is even more evident in the third parable, The Prodigal Son. Indeed the very title by which this parable is known in the church declares the parable's clear intent. This is the story of a son who has wandered away from his father! The New Testament  does not disclose any sense in which unregenerate people may be considered as "sons of God."<br> It follows, therefore, that the reference is to a Christian who has gone astray, just as the lost sheep and the lost coin have exactly the same reference.</p>
<p>
It is notable that even in the far country where the Prodigal squanders his resources, he is fully conscious of his sonship. We are told: "But when he came to himself, he said, <font color= "blue">'How many of my father's hired servants have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger! I will arise and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you, and am no longer worthy to be called your son, Make me as one of your hired servants'" (Luke 15:17-19</font>). Are these the words of an unsaved person? I Hardly Think So.</p>
<p>
Even after squandering the resources that his father had placed in his hands, the Prodigal is still fully aware that he is his father's son. He is also aware of the lofty privilege of being a son, but he now feels that his conduct makes him unworthy of such a status. He intends to tell his father to reduce him to the level of a hired servant, not because he is not a son, but because he feels he is<br> <font color= "blue">"no longer worthy to be called your son. Make me like one of your hired servants."(Luke 15:) </font> <br>We hear an echo of these words in that lovely statement, <font color= "blue">
"Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called children of God!" 1 John 3:1</font> The Prodigal feels he has fallen far below the privilege of being called a child or son of his father.</p>
<p>
The repentant Prodigal now goes back home and is welcomed unconditionally by his father who <font color= "blue">
"ran and fell on his neck and kissed him" (Luke 15:20)</font>.<br> The son's confession is genuine but he underestimates the fullness of his father's forgiving grace. So he not only says, <font color= "blue">
"Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight, and am no longer worthy to be called your son" (Luke 15:21)</font>.<br>

The father brushes such an idea aside, and he says, <font color= "blue">"Bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet" <br>(Luke 15:22)</font>. This is not the treatment accorded to hired servants! <br>And the father also says, <font color= "blue">
"And bring the fatted calf here and kill it, and let us eat and be merry; for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found" (Luke 15:23-24)</font>. Both in terms of his treatment of the Prodigal, as well as by his direct announcement, the father proclaims the returning young man is his son.</p>
<p>
But it should be noted carefully that he is not just now becoming his son.<br> On the contrary this same son previous to this had been "dead" and "lost," but is now "alive" and "found." These words of course do not mean that this son had somehow literally lost his life. Instead they describe his period of separation from his father. On the level of the entirely human experience in this parable, the father has felt the absence of his son as deeply as if he had died, because he had totally lost contact with him. Their reunion is like a glorious coming to life and a joyful rediscovery of the shared father-son experience. Any father who has long been separated from a son whom he loves dearly can fully relate to these words.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
An enormous waste </font>
<p>
Once this parable is properly understood as applying to the restoration of a straying Christian, its vital lessons leap to life. To begin with, just as the Prodigal <font color= "blue">
"wasted his possessions with prodigal living" (Luke 15:13)</font>, so also the straying Christian wastes the resources God has placed in his possession. Time spent out of touch with God is an enormous waste of time, energy, strength, ability, and opportunity. When such a Christian is restored to the Lord, he often experiences profound regret for what has been wasted during his period of separation from God. This is especially true when the separation has lasted for years, as it sometimes does. I actually know fellow Christians who have expressed exactly this idea to me.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
A deep sense of unworthiness</font>
<p>
In returning to God, particularly after a long separation from Him, repentant Christians are likely to experience a deep sense of unworthiness.<br> They may feel that they have disgraced the Christian name and they may be all too aware of bringing disrepute to God their heavenly Father.<br> Such Christians need to be reassured of the full and gracious acceptance God extends to them when they return. Their forgiveness is complete and they need not feel as if they are forever second-class Christians, as if they now served God as mere hired servants. Instead they should be encouraged to enjoy all the privileges of sonship, symbolised by the robe, the ring, and the sandals.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Lost opportunities </font>
<p>
But as is transparent from the story, though the Prodigal returns to the full experience of sonship, he does not get back the possessions he has foolishly squandered. Restoration for the straying Christian is real, but the loss of time, potential, and opportunity is equally real. The portion of any Christian's life that is spent away from God, as well as the rewards that might have been earned during that time, are permanently lost.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
A time to rejoice</font>
<p>
But though all this is true and sobering, it does not destroy the reality of the joy that should always be a part of the "home-coming" of a repentant son.<br> The parable assures us that God our Father always rejoices when one of His sons comes home. And if He does, so should we.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
The Elder Brother’s Reaction</font>
<p>
The father’s party for his younger son began immediately. It began during the workday so his oldest son was still working in the field. Hearing partying and not understanding why, he asked his servant what was going on. <br>The servant answered, <font color= "blue">
"Your brother has come, and because he has received him safe and sound, your father has killed the fatted calf" (Luke 15:27)</font>. <br>Rather than rejoicing the older son became angry and was not willing to go in; so his father came out and began pleading with him.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
The Brother’s Complaint</font>
<p><font color= "blue">
So he answered and said to his father, "Lo, these many years I have been serving you; I never transgressed your commandment at any time; and yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might make merry with my friends  But as soon as this son of yours came, who has devoured your livelihood with harlots, you killed the fatted calf for him." (Luke 15:29-30)</font>
<p><font size="+1">
The Father’s Reply</font>
<p>
The father’s reaction to his older son was tenderness itself. He reassured him of his importance and reminded him that all he had was his. Notice how he referred to his younger son. He did not call him “my son” though that is the way he thought of him. He called him, “your brother.” He wished to emphasise the fact that they were brothers and that his brother who had been dead was now alive and who was lost, was found.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
No grounds to doubt</font>
<p>
Finally, as this story shows, if the gospel is properly understood, the backsliding Christian will have no grounds to doubt his salvation, even when he is in the far country of sin. Like the Prodigal himself, he will still know that he is a son of the Father whose fellowship he has left. <br>
The older brother is often likened to the Pharisees expressing scorn and indignation and they would not recognise they were lost.
