Lost and Hurting People
</h1>
<h3>
Jesus and the Samaritan woman 
</h3>
<p>
In first three verses of John 4 we discover that Jesus is gaining more and more disciples, more disciples than John the Baptist (cf John 3:23,26). <br> And we learn that Jesus’ closest disciples are baptising the new followers.<br>  This “religious movement” was gaining momentum and was causing some concern for the Pharisees.  To avoid becoming involved in a futile confrontation from the Pharisees, Jesus and His disciples leave Judea to travel north to Galilee.</p>
<p>
In John 4:4 we are given the impression that there was some pressing necessity for Jesus to travel through Samaria.  Jews travelling between Judea and Galilee normally went around Samaria (a six day journey), but Jesus was compelled by Holy Spirit to travel through Samaria for a divine appointment.</p>
<p>
The Samaritans had developed their own compromised version of Judaism. <br> They believed in Yahweh (God’s name) but they worshipped at Mt Gerizim instead of Jerusalem.  The Samaritans had adapted their own syncretised worship practices, and they had their own Pentateuch in Aramaic which differed somewhat from the Hebrew Pentateuch.  They did not accept the poetic books or prophetic books of the Old Testament as Scripture.  In around 400BC the Samaritans built a temple on Mount Gerizim. This caused a lot of tension and hostility between the Jews and Samaritans.  The Jews ultimately destroyed the Samaritan temple in 128/9BC. <br> (The Samaritan religious community still exists today.)</p>
<p>
The Jews regarded the Samaritans as ignorant, superstitious, mongrels, outside of God’s favour or consideration, and they would not associate with them. The Samaritans however were still very part of God’s plans as shown in this chapter of John’s gospel.  Later, Jesus would specifically mention Samaria when He told His disciples: <font color= "blue">“you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth." (Acts 1:8).</font>
<h3>
The Woman at the Well 
</h3>
<p>
John 4:5-6 sets the scene for this narrative.  It is midday, and Jesus and his disciples have arrived at a Samaritan town called Sychar which is close to the land Jacob gave to Joseph’s descendants.  Exhausted from the journey, Jesus sits alone by the well of Jacob while the disciples go into the town to buy lunch <br>(John 4:8). <br>In these verses John, again, seems to be emphasising the “Jewishness” of Jesus’ ministry, but here he is emphasising the Jewish heritage of the Samaritan town. (See also John 4:12.)</p>
<p>
In the heat of the day, a Samaritan woman came to draw water from the well.  (Some speculate that the woman came at midday to avoid meeting people because she was ashamed of her life.) What follows is an extraordinary encounter between Jesus and this unnamed woman. “Jesus ignores the centuries-old hostility between Jew and Samaritan, rides roughshod over the battlements of an entrenched gender-divide, and actually engages this woman in conversation.”  It is the longest conversation between Jesus and another person recorded in the Gospels.</p>
<p>
Jesus asks the woman to give him a drink of water.  The woman is astonished, even shocked by this request, and she points out that Jews do not associate, or have dealings with Samaritans i.e.“the sharing of eating utensils and dishes“.  This is precisely what Jesus is asking. Jesus doesn’t have His own utensil to draw water from the deep well.  He will have to share  and drink from her vessel – a Samaritan woman’s vessel!</p>
<h3>
Living Water
</h3>
<p>
Following on from this initial interaction, Jesus begins talking about living water.  However, just as Nicodemus had failed to see the spiritual meaning of being “born again” (John 3:3-4), the woman fails to see the spiritual significance of the “living water” and only sees what may be a practical advantage for her. Living water, that is, running water, was considered preferable to the still, well water that percolated through the ground.</p>
<p>
Jesus knows that this woman is “thirsty” and promises that His living water will completely quench a person’s spiritual longing and thirst.   Jesus describes this living water as becoming a spring of gushing water, eternally flowing from within the person who receives His gift.  In John 7:38-39, John explains that living water represents the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h3>
Five husbands 
</h3>
<p>
Jesus suddenly changes the subject and asks the woman to call her husband.  The woman answers honestly saying that she has no husband.  Jesus commends her honesty.  Jesus knows that the woman has had five husbands and that the man she is living with now is not her husband.  He conveys these facts without the slightest sense of criticism or condemnation.</p>

<p>
Some speculate that the woman brought up the subject of worship to change the course of conversation away from an immoral past. I would like to suggest that this woman had a genuine interest in worship and theology and was simply asking an honest theological question from someone she regarded as a prophet.</p>
<h3>
True, Spiritual Worship 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Our fathers worshipped on this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where one ought to worship.”
Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming when you will neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father. You worship what you do not know; we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews. But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him. God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.” The woman said to Him, “I know that Messiah is coming” (who is called Christ). “When He comes, He will tell us all things.”<br> Jesus said to her, “I who speak to you am He.” (John 4:20-26) </font></p>
<h3>
The Messiah and the Woman
</h3>
<p>
After Jesus’ speech about true, spiritual worship, the woman, became increasingly aware of His spiritual stature.
The woman immediately left her water jar and went into the town (cf Matt. 4:19-20). <br> This woman who had come to draw water in the middle of the day, possibly to avoid meeting anyone, was now boldly testifying throughout the town about Jesus saying, “Could this be the Messiah?”  Many people believed in Jesus because of the woman’s testimony (John 6:39).  This is remarkable because a woman’s testimony was legally worthless in those days, and this woman’s reputation may have been dubious.  These Samaritans were ready to believe, however, and they went on to trust in Jesus even more when they had heard Him for themselves.  <br>The Samaritans declared that, “Jesus is the Saviour of the world!”</p>
<h3>
Nicodemus and the Samaritan Woman
</h3>
<p>
Using Jesus’ encounter with the Samaritan woman recorded in John 4, and Jesus’ previous encounter with Nicodemus recorded in John 3, John presents the most fundamental and profound spiritual truths, and yet the Samaritan woman and Nicodemus could not be more different from each other.</p>
<p>
Nicodemus was male, a Jew, educated, and from a good family.  He was morally upright, a Pharisee, a member of the Sanhedrin, and a “teacher of Israel”<br> (John 3:10).  His name, which in Greek means “conqueror of the people”, implies strength.  Nicodemus held a prestigious position in society.  And he visits Jesus discreetly at night, possibly under the cover of darkness (John 3:1-2).</p>
</p>
<p>
In contrast, the woman was female, a Samaritan (despised by the Jews), and probably uneducated.  She may have lived an immoral life, she is nameless and possibly vulnerable.  She may also have been at outcast in her town. <br> She meets Jesus in the midday sun in what would have been a scandalous encounter according to the customs of society at that time.</p>
<p>
Nicodemus and the Samaritan woman were very different, completely different.  Yet John puts these two people side by side in his Gospel and shows that Jesus treated them with equal concern and regard, and He taught both of them precious eternal truths.</p>
