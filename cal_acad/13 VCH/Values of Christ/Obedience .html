Obedience

<h3>
The Key to Knowing God's Will
</h3>
<p>
Have you ever wondered what God's will is for your life? Have you needed to make a difficult decision and wondered what God wanted you to do in that situation?<br>

We all struggle with questions about our future.<br> Questions like:<br> How can I know God's plan for my life?<br> Which job should I take?<br> Is this the person God wants me to marry?<br> Is this a good investment to make? <br>Should I share the gospel with my boss?<br> You probably have questions you could add to that list.</p>
<p>
The greatest discovery I have ever made concerning how to know the will of God involves the following:<br>
Fully surrendering my life to the Lordship of Christ<br>
Living a life of obedience in the power of the Holy Spirit<br>
Maintaining my first love for our Lord<br>
Many Christians are trying so hard to discover the will of God that they lose the joy of the Lord and leave their first love for Him.</p>
 <p>                    
But all we need to do is abide in Christ, maintain our first love for Him, and walk in the power of the Holy Spirit, and we will be in the will of God. So as you continue to walk in the Spirit, He will guide you in making the most important decisions of life. He will also guide you in the daily, moment-by-moment decisions and actions of your life.</p>
<p>
Speaking of the Holy Spirit, Jesus says, <font color= "blue">"... when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come." (John 16:13)</font>.<br> So the key to knowing God's will is to be obedient to the guidance of the Holy Spirit of truth. If you are willing to trust and obey God and live a holy life, God will reveal Himself to you and direct your steps as a way of life.</p>
<p>
Satan is the enemy of our soul. His mission is to keep us from being effective and fruitful in our witness. But although he wields great power, Satan can never defeat us if we are completely yielded and obedient to Christ</p>
<p>
Some people are reluctant to trust God completely with their lives, fearing that He may want to make a change in their plans. Yes, He will change our plans. <br>His plans are infinitely better than the very best we could ever conceive.</p>
<p>
Is it not logical that the One who created us knows better than we the purpose for which we were created? And since He loves us enough to die for us, is it not logical to believe that His way is best (Rom 8:32)?

Obedience is the true test of our love for Christ and the secret to discovering God's will for our life.</p>
<h3>
Disobedience and Obedience
</h3>
<p><font size="+1">
Disobedience of King Saul</font>
<p>
What was God's command to King Saul through Samuel? </p>
<p> 
<font color= "blue">attack Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and do not spare them. ... but Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep, the oxen, the fatlings, the lambs(1 Sam 15:3,9)</font></p>
 <p>
How King Saul rationalised his actions. </p>
<p>
<font color= "blue">the people spared the best of the sheep and the oxen, to sacrifice to the Lord your God; (1 Sam 15:15)</font></p>
<p>
The main principle illustrated is:<br> <font color= "blue">to obey is better than sacrifice, and to heed than the fat of rams. (1 Sam 15:22)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">
Obedience of Paul</font>
<p>
What was God's command to Paul (here called Saul)?</p>
 <p><font color= "blue">
 “Arise and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do.” (Acts 9:6) </font></p>
<p>
How did he comply?</p>
 <p><font color= "blue">
“Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you came, has sent me that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.” Immediately there fell from his eyes something like scales, and he received his sight at once; and he arose and was baptised. (Acts 9:17-18)</font></p>
<p>
Paul's obedience illustrates the truth of the principle in I Sam 15:22?</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Immediately he preached the Christ in the synagogues, that He is the Son of God. (Acts 9:20)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">
Obedience of Anannias</font>
<p>
What was God's command to Anannias?</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Arise and go to the street called Straight, and inquire at the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus," (Acts 9:11)</font></p>
 <p>
What was Anannias' reaction? How did he finally respond?</p>
 <p><font color= "blue">
“Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much harm he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem. ...  Ananias went his way and entered the house; and laying his hands on him (Saul) (Acts 9:13,17)</font></p>
<p>
Why was his obedience so essential at this time?</p>
 <p><font color= "blue">
he is a chosen vessel of Mine to bear My name before Gentiles, kings, and the children of Israel.(Acts 9:15)</font>
