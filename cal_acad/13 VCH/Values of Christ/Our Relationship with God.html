   <h1>
Our Relationship with God
</h1>
<p>
For believers it is easy to think of ourselves as God's servants or his children. However, is that all God wants? Can we be a friend, a very close friend, with our Father in heaven? This article will show that God wants far more from us than most people think.</p>
<p>
The book of Revelation is almost always studied from a prophetic point of view. There are, however, statements within it that reveal God's character and his purpose for creating man. One such statement, spoken by Jesus, is in Rev 3.<br>
"<font color= "blue">If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me. (Rev 3:20)</font></p>
<p>
Jesus is giving us a hint at the kind of special relationship He ultimately wants with each of us. He wants us to to recognise His voice, open the door and invite Him in. Once inside He is more than willing to sit down, enjoy a meal, and fellowship with us one to one. How fantastic! Notice it does not say Jesus will come to our residence, pound on the door to demand we let Him in, then when inside start commanding we do certain things - or else. <br>Jesus comes to us in friendship with a desire to commune with His creation and to enjoy their presence. Our Saviour also promised this intimate relationship with us while He was on the earth (John 14:22-23).</p>
<p>
God and Jesus greatly want a close relationship with those who believe and love them. They wants to be our close personal friends! Those people throughout history who are friends of God are able to effectively interceded with Him. <br>The most striking of one of God's closes friends is Abraham.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"And the Lord said, “Shall I hide from Abraham what I am doing, (visit Sodom and Gomorrah to see how great is their sin) ...  I have known him, in order that he may command his children and his household after him, that they keep the way of the Lord, to do righteousness and justice," (Gen 18:17,19) </font></p>
<p>
The fact that we humans like and greatly enjoy friendships is evidence that God wants the same thing.</p>
<h3>
A true friend
</h3>
<p>
What are some of the attributes of a true, close friend? What must we do if we want such relationships in our lives?</p>
<p>
Real friends forgive and forget</p>
<p>
Be there in times of joy or sadness</p>
<p>
Trust each other</p>
<p>
Love each other</p>
<p>
Go the extra mile</p>
<h3>
Forgiving and Forgetting
</h3>
<p>
Our Creator constantly proves to us that He is our very best friend in this area.<br>
But God commends His own love to us because, when we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Much more, therefore, having been justified now by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him. (Rom 5)</p>
<p>
How much does our Creator want a relationship with His creation? <br>He was willing to pay the highest price possible -- the life of Jesus, His only Son. This awesome sacrifice reconciles us to Him and opens the door wide open to a relationship that will last forever.</p>
<p>
When we come under the shed blood of our Saviour, that which we have done in sin are forgiven and washed away. The apostle Paul tells us, in no uncertain terms, what our relationship is with our Father when we are forgive.<br>
<font color= "blue">
"There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit." (Rom 8:1)</font>.</p>
<p>
God forgives completely. There are no strings attached to His love and mercy. His forgiveness is so perfect and wonderful that there will come a time when our sins will be totally forgotten - forever.<br>
<font color= "blue">
"No more shall every man teach his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, "Know the Lord," for they all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, says the Lord. For I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.” (Jer 31:34)</font></p>
<h3>
A friend in time of trial and trouble
</h3>
<p>
The book of Proverbs tells us what it means to be a friend regardless of the situation.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Ointment and perfume delight the heart, and the sweetness of a man’s friend gives delight by hearty counsel. (Prov 27:9-10)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
A friend loves at all times, and a brother is born for adversity. (Prov 17:17)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
A man who has friends must himself be friendly, but there is a friend who sticks closer than a brother. (Prov 18:24)</font></p>
<p>
One of the most well-known friendships in all the Bible - King David and Jonathan - was a friendship that endured in spite of the trouble that came their way. They were truly friends who stuck closer together than brothers. <br>Their relationship was such that the Bible states the following.<br>
<font color= "blue">
"And it came to pass when he had finished speaking to Saul (his father, who hated David and wanted him dead), the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul." (1 Sam 18:1)</font></p>
<p>
Upon learning of Jonathan's tragic death in the battle of Gilboa, David was inspired to write a touching song dedicated to his friend (2 Sam 1).</p>
<p>
You and I have a friend in God. In time of need He is always there. <br>He senses when things are wrong. He knows when trouble is near.<br>
<font color= "blue">
"“Am I a God near at hand,” says the Lord, “and not a God afar off?
Can anyone hide himself in secret places, so I shall not see him?” says the Lord; “Do I not fill heaven and earth?” says the Lord." (Jer 23:23-24)</font>.</p>
<h3>
Trust
</h3>
<p>
I think that most of us can easily identify with this attribute of a best friend. <br>We all need a true confidant -- someone to whom we can come and discuss our innermost problems. This is just the way God is with us.<br> Remember in John 15 where Jesus says He now calls us friends? Read again a piece of this quote:<br>
<font color= "blue">
"No longer do I call you servants, for a servant does not know what his master is doing; but I have called you friends, for all things that I heard from My Father I have made known to you." (John 15:15)</font></p>
<p>
Christ does not consider or call us mere servants for a reason.<br> Servants are not privy to what his master is thinking and doing.<br>Friends, however, know this from each other. All things that Jesus hears from the Father He confides in us! This speaks volumes concerning the kind of profound relationship that the Father and Son desire to have with us!</p>
<p>
When we pray do we pour out our hearts to the Father and tell Him things no one else knows? On the other hand, do we coldly recite a prayer that tells God next to nothing but demands He grants certain promises to you as if He needed to fulfil a contract agreement? Is our relationship with our Maker based on love and respect or Biblical facts and figures?<br> The Bible admonishes us to <font color= "blue">"Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded". (James 4:8)</font>.</p>
<p>
God must be allowed to enter that which is our personal life - to eat, walk, play and relax with us. Our heavenly Father and His beloved Son desire that we know them even as they are known.</p>
<h3>
Love
</h3>
<p>
Friends that are true friends can find enjoyment just by being together.<br> This is what Paul was discussing when he wrote to the Romans.
<font color= "blue"><br>
Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil. Cling to what is good. Be kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, in honour giving preference to one another; (Rom 12:9-10)</font></p>
<p>
Notice once again how Paul put the type of love we are to have in his letter to Philippi.<br>
<font color= "blue">
fulfil my joy by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind (Phil 2:2) </font><p>
<p>
When sinful, backsliding ancient Israel found themselves in a great deal of trouble, it was God who cared for them and was compassionate. He hurt along with His children. Paul the apostle described how Jesus knows our temptations when he wrote the following.<br>
<font color= "blue">
Seeing then that we have a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathise with our weaknesses, but was in all points tempted as we are, yet without sin (Heb 4:14-15)</font></p>
<p>
God has always related to the trials, tribulations and troubles of mankind. <br>Our Saviour willingly relinquished everything He had - power, glory, honour, life eternal with pain or care and so on. There was nothing more He could give. <br>He truly gave it all.<br>
<font color= "blue">
"This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have loved you." (John 15:12)</font></p>
<p>
In closing, God and Jesus want us to have a close personal friendship with them and to love them as they love us. If we want to reach our height of spiritual maturity and love, then it is necessary for us to draw close to our Maker.</p>
