Jesus’ Compassion
</h1>
<p>
What does it mean to offer Jesus’ Compassion to those around us?
In the four Gospels, there are several instances where Jesus showed compassion to others. Jesus reached out to the lame, the blind, the deaf, the demon possessed, the poor and people who were struggling and needed the touch of the Saviour. Below are examples of how Jesus showed compassion toward others and what we can learn from His example to show His compassion to those around us.</p>

In Matt 14 it says that <font color= "blue">
“Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and He was moved with compassion toward them, and healed their sick.” (Matt 14:14)</font><br>
What are some ways that you can be caring toward others? Here are some suggestions: send cards, emails, call, prepare meals, offer rides, be a friend.</p>

<p>
In John 4:4-26 Jesus approached a Samaritan woman, asking for a drink of water which was not acceptable in Jesus’ time because the Jews and Samaritans did not associate with each other. In the course of this direct and open conversation with this woman, Jesus’ compassion for her eternal destination was evident and eventually, it wasn’t only she that believed but many other Samaritans. <br>Sometimes we need to be more open and direct with those around us as we share Jesus with them.</p>

<p>
In Mark 5, Jesus tells the demon-possessed man <font color= "blue"> “Go home to your friends, and tell them what great things the Lord has done for you, and how He has had compassion on you.” (Mark 5:19)</font>. Jesus wanted this man to let others know what mercy looks like. What does mercy look like to you? And how can we be merciful toward others?</p>

<p>
In Matt 20, <font color= "blue">“Jesus had compassion, and touched their eyes and immediately their eyes received sight and they followed Him.” (Matt 20:34)</font><br> Are we passionate about people who don’t know the Lord? Jesus performed many miracles and He was about His Father’s business as He healed many and drew them toward Himself.</p>

In Mark 6 it says, <font color= "blue">“And Jesus, when He came out, saw a great multitude and was moved with compassion for them, because they were like sheep not having a shepherd. So He began to teach them many things.” (Mark 6:34)</font> <br>Jesus was always abundantly available to minister to others.<br> What time constraints do we have in our busy schedules that keep us from being available to others?</p>

<p>
In Luke 7 <font color= "blue">“when the Lord saw her (the widow whose son had died), He had compassion on her and said to her,“Do not weep.” (Luke 7:13)</font><br> Jesus could see her sorrow and he brought her son back to life. <br>Jesus was sensitive to her emotions – sometimes we just need to be there for others, not saying anything but just being present.</p>
<p><font size="+2"><font color= #FF4500;>

<p>
In Matt 9 it says, <font color= "blue">“But when He saw the multitudes, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were weary and scattered, like sheep having no shepherd.” (Matt 9:36)</font> Jesus is the Good Shepherd and we know that He laid down His life for the sheep.<br> What are we willing to sacrifice to extend His compassion to others?<br> Our time, finances, our lives!</p>
<p><font size="+2"><font color= #FF4500;>

<p>
In Mark 8 Jesus said, <font color= "blue"> “I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now continued with Me three days and have nothing to eat.” (Mark 8:2)</font><br> Jesus maintained His reliability by seeing the needs and later in the story providing for the multitudes. He met their spiritual needs but was also concerned for their physical hunger.<br> We need to be reliable when others come to us with their needs.</p>

<p>
In Matt 15 Jesus said to the disciples, <font color= "blue">““I have compassion on the multitude, because they have now continued with Me three days and have nothing to eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way.” <br>(Matt 15:32)</font> Jesus’ compassion was not a once and done action or attitude – He cared about the people who followed Him and stayed with Him.<br> We need to realise that extending Christ’s compassion is a lifestyle.</p>
<p><font size="+2"><font color= #FF4500;>
N</font><font size="+1">on-judgemental</font></font>
<p>
In the story of the woman found in adultery, John 8, Jesus challenged the Pharisees that were judgemental toward this woman to pick up a stone if they had no sin and they all disappeared one by one, and Jesus asked her <font color= "blue"><br>“Woman, where are those accusers of yours? Has no one condemned you?” <br>She said, “No one, Lord.” And Jesus said to her, “Neither do I condemn you; go and sin no more.” (John 8:3-11)</font><br> It is so easy to be judgemental with others when they are different or do things differently but Jesus extended His compassion to others through His non-judgemental attitude.</p>
