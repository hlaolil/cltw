   <h1>
Knowing God Personally
</h1>
<p>
Find God - What does it take to know God? This will explain how you can personally begin a relationship with God, right now.

What does it take to begin a relationship with God? Wait for lightning to strike? Devote yourself to unselfish religious deeds? Become a better person so that God will accept you?<br> None of these. God has made it very clear in the Bible how we can know Him. This will explain how you can personally begin a relationship with God, right now.</p>
<p>
 <h3>
Principle One 
</h3>
<p>
God loves you and offers a wonderful plan for your life.<br>
God created you. Not only that, He loves you so much that He wants you to know Him now and spend eternity with Him. Jesus said, <font color= "blue">"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life." (John 3:16)</font>

Jesus came so that each of us could know and understand God in a personal way. Jesus alone can bring meaning and purpose to life.

What keeps us from knowing God? ...</p>
<h3>
Principle Two
</h3>
<p>
All of us sin and our sin has separated us from God.<br>
We sense that separation, that distance from God because of our sin. <br>The Bible tells us that <font color= "blue">"All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned, every one, to his own way." (Isa 53:6)</font>

Deep down, our attitude may be one of active rebellion or passive indifference toward God and His ways, but it's all evidence of what the Bible calls sin.

The result of sin in our lives is death -- spiritual separation from God. Although we may try to get close to God through our own effort, we inevitably fail.

</p><img src="../../../images/content/god_peopleB.jpg" width="100" height="117" hspace="10" vspace="0" border="0" align="left" alt="">This diagram shows the great gap that exists between us and God. The arrows illustrate how we might try to reach God through our own efforts. We may try to do good things in life, or earn God's acceptance through a good life or a moral philosophy.<br> But our good efforts are insufficient to cover up our sin.<br>
How can we bridge this gulf? ...</p>
<h3>
Principle Three 
</h3>
<p>
Jesus Christ is God's only provision for our sin. Through Him we can know and experience God's love and plan for our life.<br>

We deserve to pay for our own sin. The problem is, the payment is death.<br> So that we would not have to die separated from God, out of His love for us, Jesus Christ died in our place.

The Bible states that Jesus is <font color= "blue">"The image of the invisible God, the first born over all creation." (Col 1:15,16)</font>  Jesus was crucified for blasphemy -- for clearly identifying Himself as equal to God -- which He was and still is.

On the cross, Jesus took all of our sin on Himself and completely, fully paid for it. <font color= "blue">"For Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God" (1 Peter 3:18)</font><br>  <font color= "blue">"not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us," (Titus 3:5) </font><br> Because of Jesus' death on the cross, our sin doesn't have to separate us from God any longer.

</p><img src="../../../images/content/god_people2B.jpg" width="120" height="190" hspace="10" vspace="10" border="0" align="left" alt=""><font color= "blue">"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life" (John 3:16)</font><br>
Jesus not only died for our sin, He rose from the dead.<br>(1 Cor 15:3-6 ) When He did, He proved beyond doubt that He can rightfully promise eternal life -- that He is the Son of God and the only means by which we can know God. That is why Jesus said,<font color= "blue"> "I am the way, the truth and the life; no one can come to the Father except through Me." (John 14:6)</font></p>
<p>
Instead of trying harder to reach God, He tells us how we can begin a relationship with Him right now. Jesus says,<font color= "blue"> "If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes in Me ... out of his heart will flow rivers of living water." (John 7:37-38)</font><br> It was Jesus' love for us that caused Him to endure the cross.
And He now invites us to come to Him, that we might begin a personal relationship with God. Just knowing what Jesus has done for us and what He is offering us is not enough. <br>To have a relationship with God, we need to welcome Him into our life ...
<h3>
Principle Four
</h3>
<p>
We must individually accept Jesus Christ as Saviour and Lord.<br>

The Bible says, <font color= "blue">"But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name:" (John 1:12)</font><br>

We accept Jesus by faith. The Bible says, <font color= "blue">"For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God,not of works, lest anyone should boast" (Eph 2:8-9)</font><br>

Accepting Jesus means believing that Jesus is the Son of God, who He claimed to be, then inviting Him to guide and direct our lives. (John 3:1-8).<br> Jesus said, <font color= "blue">"I have come that they may have life, and that they may have it more abundantly." (John 10:10)</font><br>

And here is Jesus' invitation. He said, <font color= "blue">"I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him ..." (Rev 3:20)</font><br>

How will you respond to God's invitation?</p>

<p>Consider these two circles:</p><img src="../../../images/content/selfdirected.jpg" width="120" height="120" hspace="10" vspace="0" border="0" align="left" alt="">

 <font size="+1">Self-Directed Life</font></p>

<p>Self is on the throne</p>

<p>Jesus is outside the life</p>

<p>Decisions and actions are solely directed by self, often resulting &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;in frustration.</p>

</p><img src="../../../images/content/christdirected.jpg" width="120" height="120" hspace="10" vspace="0" border="0" align="left" alt="">

<font size="+1">Christ-Directed Life</font></p>

Jesus is in the life and on the throne</p>

Self is yielding to Jesus</p>

<p>The person sees Jesus' influence and direction in their life.</p>


<p>Which circle best represents your life?

Which circle would you like to have represent your life?</p>
<p>
Begin a relationship with Jesus ...<br>



You can receive Christ right now. Remember that Jesus says, <font color= "blue">"I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him ..." (Rev 3:20)</font> Would you like to respond to His invitation? Here's how.</p>
<p>
The precise words you use to commit yourself to God are not important. <br>He knows the intentions of your heart. If you are unsure of what to pray, this might help you put it into words:<br>

"Jesus, I want to know You. I want You to come into my life. Thank You for dying on the cross for my sin so that I could be fully accepted by You.<br> Only You can give me the power to change and become the person You created me to be. Thank You for forgiving me and giving me eternal life with God. <br>I give my life to You. Please do with it as You wish. Amen."</p>
<p>
If you sincerely asked Jesus into your life just now, then He has come into your life as He promised. You have begun a personal relationship with God.<br>

What follows is a lifelong journey of change and growth as you get to know God better through Bible reading, prayer and interaction with other Christians.</p>
