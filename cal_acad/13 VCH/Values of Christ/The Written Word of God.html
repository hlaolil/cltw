   <h1>
The Written Word of God
</h1>
<h3>
Jesus’ witness to Scripture
</h3>
<p>
Jesus was willing to argue with the Pharisees on many issues, but He did not seem to argue with their view of the Scriptures. Although Jesus disagreed on interpretations and traditions, He apparently agreed with other Jewish leaders that the Scriptures were authoritative for faith and practice.</p>
<p>
Jesus expected every word in Scripture to be fulfilled (Matt 5:17-18;<br>Mark 14:49). He quoted Scripture to prove his points (Matt 9:13; 22:31; 26:24; 26:31; John 10:34); He rebuked people for not reading Scripture carefully enough (Matt 22:29; Luke 24:25; John 5:39). He referred to Old Testament people and events without any hint that they were not real.</p>
<p>
Scripture had the authority of God behind it. When Jesus answered Satan’s temptations, He said, <font color= "blue">"It is written" (Matt 4:4-10)</font>. The fact that something was written in Scripture meant, for Jesus, that it was an indisputable authority. <br>The words of David were inspired by the Holy Spirit (Mark 12:36); a prophecy was given "through" Daniel (Matt 24:15) because its real origin was God.</p>
<p>
Jesus said in Matt 19:4-5 that the Creator said in Gen 2: <font color= "blue">"a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh." (Gen 2:24)</font><br> However, Genesis does not describe this verse as the words of God. Jesus could say that God said it simply because it was in Scripture. The assumption is that God is the ultimate author of all of Scripture.

The evidence throughout the Gospels is that Jesus viewed Scripture as reliable and trustworthy. <br>As He reminded the Jewish leaders, <font color= "blue">"the Scripture cannot be broken" <br>(John 10:35)</font>. Jesus expected it to be valid; He even upheld the validity of old covenant commands while the old covenant was still in force (Matt 8:4; 23:23).</p>
<h3>
Witness of the apostles
</h3>
<p>
The apostles, like their teacher, considered Scripture authoritative. They quoted it repeatedly, often as proof of an argument. The sayings of Scripture are treated as words of God. Scripture is even personalised as the God who spoke to Abraham and Pharaoh (Rom 9:17; Gal 3:8).<br> What David or Isaiah or Jeremiah wrote was actually spoken by God, and therefore certain (Acts 1:16; 4:25; 13:35; 28:25; Heb 1:6-10; 10:15). <br>The law of Moses is assumed to reflect the mind of God (1 Cor 9:9). <br>The real author of Scripture is God (1 Cor 6:16; Rom 9:25).</p>
<p>
Paul called the Scriptures <font color= "blue">"the oracles of God" (Rom 3:2).</font> <br>Peter says that the prophets <font color= "blue">"spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit"<br> (2 Peter 1:21)</font>. The prophets didn’t make it up—God inspired them, and He is the real origin of their words. They often wrote, "the word of the Lord came..." or "Thus says the Lord..."<br>

Paul also told Timothy that: <br><font color= "blue">"All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness" (2 Tim 3:16)</font>. <br>It is as if God breathed His message through the biblical writers.</p>
<p>
However, we must not read into this our modern ideas of what "God-breathed" has to mean.<br> We must remember that Paul said this about the Greek Septuagint translation (the Scriptures that Timothy had known since childhood—2 Tim 3:15), and this translation is in some places considerably different than the Hebrew original. Paul used this translation as the word of God without meaning that it was a perfect text.

Despite its translation discrepancies, it is God-breathed and able to make people <font color= "blue">"wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus" (2 Tim 3:15)</font> and it is still able to equip believers <font color= "blue">"for every good work" (2 Tim 3:17)</font>.</p>
<h3>
Imperfect communication
</h3>
<p>
The original word of God is perfect, and God can certainly enable people to state it accurately, to preserve it accurately and (to complete the communication) make us understand it accurately. But God has not done all this. <br>Our copies have grammatical errors, copyist errors, and (far more significantly) humans always make errors in receiving the message.<br> There is "noise" that prevents us from hearing perfectly the word God inspired to be written in Scripture. Nevertheless, God uses Scripture to speak to us today.</p>
<p>
Despite the "noise" that puts human mistakes between God and us, the purpose of Scripture is accomplished: to tell us about salvation and about right behaviour. God accomplishes His purpose in Scripture: He communicates His word to us with enough clarity that we can be saved and we can learn what He wants us to do.</p>
<p>
Scripture, even in a translation, is accurate for its purpose. But we would be wrong to expect more from it than God intended. He is not teaching us astronomy or science. The numbers in Scripture are not always mathematically precise by today’s standards. We must look at Scripture for its purpose, not for minor details.</p>
<p>
For example, in Acts 21:11, Agabus was inspired to say that the Jews would bind Paul and hand him over to the Gentiles. Some people might assume that Agabus was specifying who would tie Paul up, and what they would do with him. But as it turns out, Paul was actually rescued by the Gentiles and bound by the Gentiles (Acts 21:30-33).<br>

Is this a contradiction? Technically, yes. The prediction was true in principle, but not in the details. Of course, when Luke wrote this, he could have easily doctored the prediction to fit the result, but he was willing to let the differences be seen. He did not expect people to expect precision in such details. This should warn us about expecting precision in all the details of Scripture.<br>

We need to focus on the main point of the message. Similarly, Paul made a mistake when he wrote 1 Cor 1:14 — a mistake he corrected in 1 Cor 1:16. The inspired Scriptures contain both the mistake and the correction.</p>
<h3>
Proof of the Bible
</h3>
<p>
No one can prove that all of the Bible is true. They may show that a particular prophecy came true, but they cannot show that the entire Bible has the same validity. This is based more on faith. We see the historical evidence that Jesus and the apostles accepted the Old Testament as the word of God. <br>The biblical Jesus is the only one we have; other ideas are based on guesswork, not new evidence. We accept the teaching of Jesus that the Holy Spirit would guide the disciples into more truth. We accept the claim of Paul that he wrote with divine authority. We accept that the Bible reveals to us who God is and how we may have fellowship with Him.</p>
<p>
We accept the testimony of church history, that Christians through the centuries have found the Bible useful for faith and practice. This book tells us who God is, what He did for us, and how we should respond. Tradition also tells us which books are in the biblical canon. We trust that God guided the process so that the end result accomplishes His purpose.</p>
<p>
Our experience also testifies to the accuracy of Scripture. This is the book that has the honesty to tell us about our own sinfulness, and the grace to offer us a cleansed conscience. It gives us moral strength not through rules and commands, but in an unexpected way—through grace and the ignominious death of our Lord.</p>
<p>
The Bible testifies to the love, joy and peace we may have through faith—feelings that are, just as the Bible describes, beyond our ability to put into words. This book gives us meaning and purpose in life by telling us of divine creation and redemption. These aspects of biblical authority cannot be proven to sceptics, but they help verify the Scriptures that tell us these things that we experience.</p>
<p>
The Bible does not sugar-coat its heroes, and this also helps us accept it as honest. It tells us about the failings of Abraham, Moses, David, the nation of Israel, and the disciples. The Bible is a word that bears witness to a more authoritative Word, the Word made flesh, and the good news of God’s grace.</p>
<p>
The Bible is not simplistic; it does not take the easy way out. The New Testament claims both continuity and discontinuity with the old covenant. It would be simpler to eliminate one or the other, but it is more challenging to have both. Likewise, Jesus is presented as both human and divine, a combination that does not fit well into Hebrew, Greek or modern thought. This complexity was not created through ignorance of the philosophical problems, but in spite of them.</p>
<p>
The Bible is a challenging book, not likely to be the result of fishermen attempting a fraud or trying to make sense of hallucinations.<br> Jesus’ resurrection gives additional weight to the book that announces such an phenomenal event. It gives additional weight to the testimony of the disciples as to who Jesus was and to the unexpected logic of conquering death through the death of the Son of God.</p>
<p>
Repeatedly, the Bible challenges our thinking about God, ourselves, life, right and wrong. It commands respect by conveying truths to us we do not obtain elsewhere. Just as the proof of the pudding is in the eating, the proof of the Bible is in its application to our lives.</p>
<p>
The testimony of Scripture, of tradition, of personal experience and reason all support the authority of the Bible. The fact that it is able to speak across cultures, to address situations that never existed when it was written, is also a testimony to its abiding authority. The proof of the Bible is conveyed to believers as the Holy Spirit uses it to change their hearts and lives.</p>
