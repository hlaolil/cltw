   <h1>
Jesus The Master Teacher
</h1>
<p>
Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews, conceded that Jesus of Nazareth 

was a teacher. <font color= "blue">“Rabbi, we know that You are 

a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that You 

do unless God is with him.” (John 3:2)</font>.<br> 
A wealthy young ruler approached the Lord asking, <font color= 

"blue">“Teacher, what good thing shall I do, that I may have 

eternal life?” (Matt 19:16)</font>.<br>
Even Jesus’ enemies addressed Him as “Teacher” (Matt 22:16,24), 

though their use of the expression was not always genuine. The 

Lord is addressed as “Teacher” twenty-nine times in the 

Gospels. The noun (teacher) and verb (teach) combined are used 

of Jesus some ninety times.</p>
<p>
Christ’s teaching was informative, logical, buttressed by Old 

Testament evidence, well-illustrated, documented by divine 

power, original, and uniquely authoritative (Matt 7:28). <br>When 

officers once were sent to arrest him, they returned to their 

superiors empty-handed, exclaiming: <font color= "blue">“No man 

ever spoke like this Man!” (John 7:46)</font>.<br> The Lord’s 

various methods of teaching beg for careful study.</p>
<h3>
Sermons
</h3>
<p>
Formal sermons were rare in the Savior’s repertoire of teaching 

tools. There is, of course, the renowned Sermon on the Mount, 

in which Christ set forth principles for discipleship, dealing 

with such issues as:</p>
<p>
the blessedness (bliss, happiness) of holy living (Matt 5:1-

12);</p>
<p>godly influence (Matt 13-16);</p>
<p>the nature of the Mosaic law (Matt 17-20);</p>
<p>moral issues (Matt 21-48);</p>
<p>proper demeanour in worship (Matt 6:1-18);</p>
<p>the dangers of materialism (Matt 19-24);</p>
<p>the stress-free life (Matt 25-34);</p>
<p>proper attitudes toward others and God (Matt 7:1-12);</p>
<p>the consequences of wrongdoing (Matt 13-29).</p>

<p>The Olivet Discourse (Matt 24-25), delivered shortly before His 

death, dealt with:

<p>the impending destruction of Jerusalem (Matt 24:1-34);
<p>the second coming of Christ and the judgement (Matt 35-51);
<p>some parables and instruction concerning preparedness (Matt 

25:1-46).</p>
<h3>
Conversations
</h3>
<p>
Jesus was more of a conversationalist than an orator. He walked 

with people and talked with them. He sat and spoke of soul 

matters. He was interested in individuals, recognising the 

value of each soul.
<p>(G. Campbell Morgan (1863-1945) was a noted British writer. 

One of his superb volumes was The Great Physician – The Method 

of Jesus with Individuals. <br>In this book Morgan discussed the 

methodology of Jesus’ teaching to forty different persons—from 

John the Baptist to “doubting” Thomas.)</p>

<p>The Lord’s night time conversation with Nicodemus allowed 

the teacher to introduce this Jewish ruler, a member of the 

Sanhedrin (cf. John 7:50), to the kingdom of God and the 

conditions of the born-again process by which one enters that 

regime (John 3:3-5). <br>And rich dividends it paid. The ruler 

defended the Lord before his peers <br>(John 7:46-52) and assisted 

Joseph of Arimathea in the preparation of Christ’s body for 

burial (John 19:38-42). Faith—from the bud to the flower!</p>
<p>
Consider the Lord’s conversation with the Samaritan woman at 

Jacob’s well (John 4:1-42). All alone at the well (His 

disciples gone into a nearby village to purchase food), Jesus 

encountered a Samaritan woman who had come for water. Christ 

overcame two cultural barriers—one gender, the other racial—by 

speaking in public to a non-Jewish female (John 9,27).<br> He led 

her gently into a conversation, intriguing her with the promise 

of some sort of water that could quench one’s thirst eternally. 

He established His prophetic authority by revealing details of 

her past that no ordinary person could possibly have known. The 

lady hastily returned to her village and spread the news of 

this remarkable man. An envoy came out to see Christ; they 

invited the Lord to their village. He stayed with them two 

days, and many believed in Him.<br> The impact of this event 

cannot be fully seen until one considers Philip’s evangelistic 

success after the establishment of the church (Acts 8:2ff). <br>It 

all started with a seemingly casual conversation.</p>
<h3>
Conflicts
</h3>
<p>
Christ was not a rabble-rouser. He was not, like far too many 

today, always spoiling for a fight. He was the Prince of Peace 

(Isa 9:6). <br>Nonetheless, the nature of His mission and message 

was such that it was bound to ignite controversy—and certainly 

it did. Great truths come to light in these engagements between 

God’s Son and those who adopted the position of 

adversaries.</p>
<p>
A demoniac was brought to Jesus; the poor man was both mute and 

blind <br>(Matt 12:22ff). Christ cast out the evil spirit. The 

crowds were amazed and audibly wondered whether this might be 

“the son of David” (an expression for the Messiah). The 

Pharisees promptly charged Him with operating by the power of 

Satan.<br> <font color= "blue">“This fellow does not cast out 

demons except by Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons.” (Matt 

12:24)</font> Knowing their thoughts (a power only deity could 

possess), Jesus brilliantly refuted their allegation. With 

devastating deductive logic, proceeding from a well-known 

general truth to a specific point, Christ argued:<font color= 

"blue">
“Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation, 

and every city or house divided against itself will not stand. 

(Matt 12:25)</font><br>
Demons are servants of Satan.<br>
If, therefore, Christ (by Satan’s power) is casting out demons, 

then <font color= "blue">“the ruler of the demons” (Matt 12:24)</font> is undermining his 

own diabolic efforts! Not even he is that obtuse! By default, 

therefore, the Lord’s power over demons was shown to be divine

—not satanic.</p>
<p>
The eighth chapter of John is “hot” with conflict. The Lord had 

identified Himself as <font color= "blue">“the light of the 

world” (John 8:12)</font>, which implied those who refused His 

teaching were in darkness. The Jewish leaders disputed Him.<br> He 

informed them <font color= "blue">"if you do not believe that I 

am He, you will die in your sins.” (John 8:24)</font>; <br>He 

foretold they would kill Him (John 8:28). But He would maintain His 

integrity, <font color= "blue">“I always do those things that please Him.”</font> 

(John 8:29).<br> Christ’s attention was then directed toward those who 

had “believed” Him, but with a superficial faith (John 8:31ff; 

especially John 8:44). <br>The interaction became intense. The careful 

student may note how often the debate went back and forth, <br>
<font color= "blue">
“Jesus said ... They answered Him ...” (John 8:31,33, etc.). </font><br>

The Jews claimed to be Abraham’s offspring; Christ denied they 

were “seed” in the loftiest sense of the expression.<br> They 

slurred Him,<font color= "blue"> “We were not born of fornication; we have one Father—God.” (John 8:41);</font> <br>

He challenged them <font color= "blue">Which of you convicts Me of sin? (John 8:46)</font>, but they 

could not. <br>The debate concluded with the Lord’s magnificent 

claim that He existed eternally before Abraham was born—a claim 

of absolute deity  <br><font color= "blue">“Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.” (John 8:58)</font>.<br> They attempted to stone Him but 

could not, because “His hour” had not arrived.</p>
<h3>
Pearls in Parables
</h3>
<p>
During the early portion of His ministry Christ taught in open 

prose. <br>As animosity against Him intensified, He changed His 

method, employing the use of parables. Parables served a 

twofold function. They were delightful stories that, when 

explained, revealed important truths. Without explanation, 

however, the lessons remained obscure. Thus instruction could 

be conveyed to His disciples, yet concealed from His 

enemies.</p>
<p>
The Savior’s parabolic instruction alone would have 

immortalised Him as a teacher. For example:</p>

<p>He issued a dozen parables regarding the coming kingdom, 

i.e., the church established on Pentecost (Acts 2)</p>
<p>for example its nature, growth, influence, diversity, 

blessings, etc. (Matt 13).</p>
<p>He demonstrated the preciousness of those lost, as evaluated 

by God (Luke 15).</p>
<p>Christ emphasised the compassion of Heaven and the divine 

desire to bestow forgiveness (Matt 18:21-35).</p>
<p>The Lord stressed the power of persistent prayer (Luke 18:1

-8).</p>
<p>Jesus taught the value of conscientious stewardship 

respecting one’s possessions, over against the curse of 

materialism (Luke 12:16-21).</p>
<p>He urged the wise to be prepared for a day of accountability 

(Matt 25:1-13).</p>
<p>These message-bearing stories have embalmed valuable truths 

across twenty centuries, blessing the lives of countless 

souls.</p>
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
The benevolent influence of Jesus’ teaching is beyond 

reasonable dispute. Even the skeptical philosopher Ernest Renan 

(1823-92), who opposed Christian tradition on almost all 

points, stated: “Jesus will ever be the creator of the pure 

spirit of religion; the Sermon on the Mount will never be 

surpassed”.</p>
<p>
As His critics, both ancient and modern, fade into the 

obscurity they so justly deserve, the Son of God, who adorned 

this earth with His presence two thousand years ago, will 

continue to exert His influence through a vast conglomerate of 

students around the globe, who will bless humanity because of 

the teacher at whose feet they have received instruction.
