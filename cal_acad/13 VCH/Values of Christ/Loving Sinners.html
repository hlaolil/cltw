Loving Sinners

<h3>
Jesus and the tax collector
</h3>
<p>
The tax collector that Jesus encounters in Luke 5:27 is a man named Levi.<br>With the name Levi, he is probably from the tribe of Levi, the tribe set apart for service in the temple. As a tax collector, Levi would not be allowed to serve in such a role. Following this account, he is never again called Levi, but instead, Matthew (cf. Matt 9:9). Levi means “joined” whereas Matthew means “gift of God.” Matthew eventually writes the Gospel of Matthew, which tells the story of Jesus for a Jewish audience. It is unknown when, how, or why he changed his name, but maybe he changed it to reflect his new identity as a result of what happens in this text.</p>
<p>
When Jesus encountered Levi he was sitting in the tax office, which is not a constructed building, but rather a movable booth set up at various locations to tax the people travelling along a road or gathering in a particular location.</p>
<p>
Jesus, seeing Levi collecting taxes at his tax booth, said to him, “Follow Me.” <br>The request by Jesus for Levi to follow is a request for Levi to leave everything behind, and break all other ties. The fact that Jesus was making such a request to one who was outside the bounds of the worshipping community reveals that in Jesus, God has broken through the barriers which “had been considered insurmountable. It is precisely the unclean, the disobedient, the sinner who is called in this case”.</p>
<p>
Alfred Edersheim, a Biblical scholar and historian, believes that Levi followed Jesus about and taxed the crowds that came to hear Jesus teach (Edersheim 1988:519). Since Jesus gathered crowds wherever He went and tax collectors would set up their booth wherever people moved along a road or gathered, placing a tax booth wherever Jesus went would have been quite profitable for Levi. If Edersheim is right, Levi was already following Jesus around, and taxing the people who gathered to hear Him teach. Jesus Himself was probably taxed on various occasions as well.</p>
<p>
Of course, as Levi taxed the people who gathered, he would have seen the miracles Jesus performed, and heard what Jesus taught. Tax collectors were not allowed to attend the synagogue for the teaching of Scripture, but if Levi had been following Jesus for some time, he would have heard on multiple occasions the truths Jesus taught about the love of God, forgiveness, and eternal life.</p>
<p>
Jesus probably noticed that the presence of a tax collector bothered His disciples and many of the others who gathered to hear Him teach.<br> And yet, rather than ask Levi to stop following Him around, Jesus does the opposite, and actually invites Levi to officially become one of His followers! <br>Jesus doesn’t care that society hates Levi. Jesus doesn’t care that Levi is a wretched sinner. He just wants Levi to follow Him.</p>
<p>
In Jewish culture, it was normal for Rabbis to gather followers around them.<br> But as seen here, Jesus did it in an entirely unusual way. 
John 1:36 describes how disciples typically sought out their teachers and presented themselves for the learning relationship. Only after careful examination did the rabbi extend an invitation. The calibre of the disciples reflected greatly upon the reputation of the rabbi. Only the brightest and best were accepted.</p>
<p>
The more familiar pattern for Jesus was His recruiting disciples, seeking them out and calling them to follow Him. This would no doubt seem a desperate approach for a rabbi, as if no deserving students would approach Him.<br> Unlike others, Jesus called His disciples to come and follow Him.<br>

And even in selecting His disciples, Jesus did not choose the best and the brightest, but rather the outcast, despised, and rejected. Levi certainly fitted the bill. The attitude of Jesus toward Levi was in complete contrast to the other religious people of His day. Those whom they rejected, He accepted.<br> Those whom they despised, He loved. Those whom they avoided, Jesus sought. In the calling of Levi by Jesus, grace has become an event.<br> The question of whether or not Levi’s sins have been forgiven is irrelevant.<br> The calling of Levi proves that through Jesus, forgiveness of sins has been granted to all, even to the worst of sinners.</p>
<h3>
The tax collector left all and followed Jesus
</h3>
<p>
In response to the invitation of Jesus, Levi left all, rose up, and followed Him. This is nearly identical to the response of Peter, James, and John when Jesus called them to be fishers of men in Luke 5:11. They left their boats, nets, and record catch of fish to follow Jesus.<br> Levi does the same thing. Levi recognised a good opportunity when he saw it. The cost of leaving everything behind to follow Jesus was well worth it.</p>
<p>
Once Levi left his booth, it was like turning in his resignation.<br> Very likely, the tax gathering booth did not stay empty for long. The position was probably filled within a day. Although being a tax gatherer cost you your friends and family and the respect of your neighbours, it gave you great wealth, and there are always people who will do almost anything for money.<br> In that society, just like in ours, there were men who were willing to be seen as a traitor if they could just become rich. Though tax collectors were hated, there were always people ready and waiting to become a tax collector.<br>

Luke says nothing here about the issue of Levi’s eternal destiny.<br> The text does not indicate one way or the other that Levi believed in Jesus for eternal life.</p>
<h3>
The tax collector hosted a party for Jesus
</h3>
<p>
Though Levi had left his tax booth behind, he still was able to invite Jesus to a great feast in his own house. Though he had left his job, he had not given up his house or all his money. He had simply stopped working as a tax collector. <br>And one of the first things he does is host a party for Jesus. This is the first of many parties in Luke’s gospel, and as with all parties, is a sign of the new era being initiated by Jesus.<br>

Also at this party were a great number of tax collectors and others.<br> Being socially outcast, tax collectors and others like them were the only type of people Levi knew. He didn’t know any upright and socially acceptable people, as they would not want him for a friend. Levi and his companions are not the “moral upper crust of society”.<br>

In Jewish thinking, tax collectors were on the same level as prostitutes <br>(Matt 21:32). The religious people and the upright citizens didn’t want to have anything to do with either, but Jesus loves both and shows compassion toward both. Here we see Him sharing a meal with tax collectors.<br> Being religious outcasts as they were, it is unlikely that the food was ceremonially pure according to the Pharisaical standards. Jesus, however, appears to not be overly concerned about the religious purity of the food He ate.</p>
<h3>
The scribes and Pharisees complained
</h3>
<p>
As a result of Jesus eating a meal with tax collectors, the scribes and Pharisees complained. The word complained could also be translated “grumbled.”<br> While it is a rare word in the New Testament (only here and in Matt 20:11), it is used frequently in the Septuagint when the Israelites grumbled against God and Moses while wandering in the wilderness.<br>

Here, they grumble about Jesus eating with tax collectors. Jewish religious leaders went to great pains to avoid sin or even the appearance of sin. <br>They felt that sharing a meal with sinful people gave the impression that they were condoning the sin. But their separation went beyond just sharing meals. They did business as much as possible only with other Pharisees. When they travelled, they stayed with other Pharisees. Talking with a sinner or touching a sinner was bad enough. But sitting down and sharing a meal with them was off limits. Sitting and eating with a sinner was the same thing as endorsing the sin.</p>
<p>
Furthermore, while even the most observant Jew could eat with a Gentile in the Jewish home, no observant Jewish person would eat in the home of a Gentile or a sinning Jewish person, since it was impossible to know if the home was ritually pure or if the food was prepared according to kosher standards.</p>
<p>
So when the Pharisees saw Jesus eating at the house of Levi, they were concerned. He was not behaving as a Rabbi should. Furthermore, they had heard some of His teaching about the Kingdom of God, and were concerned that Jesus was including all the wrong people in it. And so they complained to Jesus and His disciples. This indicates that the disciples had also gone with Jesus to this meal. The Pharisees may have approached the disciples rather than Jesus because they had recently been bested by Him in such dialogue before.<br> Another possibility, suggested by Chrysostom, is that they were trying to instil doubt and disloyalty in the hearts of the disciples.</p>
<p>
The criticism of the religious leaders was that Jesus and the disciples ate and drank with tax collectors and sinners. Whoever the “others” (Luke 5:29) at the feast were, the scribes and Pharisees viewed them as sinners.<br> The term is not overly critical or harsh, but the Pharisees still went to great lengths to separate themselves and their disciples from such people.<br>Jesus went against all normal methods of training His followers. He not only attended parties with sinners but invited them to be His disciples.<br> Isolation from sinners is not what Jesus expects from those who follow Him.</p>
<h3>
Jesus answered the scribes and Pharisees
</h3>
<p>
Though the Pharisees complained to the disciples, Jesus must have heard their criticism, and so it was He who responded. His answer was a parabolic summary of His initial mission statement in Luke 4:17-19.<br> There, His stated mission was to liberate those who in bondage and set captives free.<br> Here, He stated that people who are well have no need of a physician, but only those who are sick. <br>He draws an analogy between the sick and sinners. When one is sick, they seek help from a doctor. The doctor diagnoses the problem, then prescribes medicine or diet and lifestyle changes to overcome the sickness and improve health. When a person is not sick, they don’t go to a doctor. Only the sick go to a doctor.</p>
<p>
Similarly, Jesus stated that He did not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance.Just as healthy people don’t need doctors, righteous people don’t need repentance. In speaking of the righteous does Jesus mean those who are truly righteous in God’s sight, or those who are self-righteous in their own eyes? Most believe He is referring to people who are self-righteous, but either way, the statement is still true.
<h3>
Repentance 
</h3>
<p>
Repentance is a turning away from sin toward obedience. As with the call to follow Jesus, repentance is not the same as believing in Jesus for eternal life. During His life, some people followed Jesus who did not believe in Him for eternal life, and some who believed in Him, did not follow Him. <br>So also with repentance. Repentance is for all men, and even non-believers can turn from their sin toward obedience to God, but this does not give them eternal life. And believers, even though they have eternal life, must continue to repent as the Spirit convicts them of patterns of sin in their lives. And it is people who have patterns and habits of sin in their lives who are the sick. <br>Those who recognise their sickness seek out a doctor.</p>
<p>
Finally, it must be noted that during His ministry, Jesus did not spend a lot of time trying to convince people of their sin. He did this occasionally, but it was not His main focus of His ministry or evangelistic efforts. Most of His time was spent helping those who already knew they needed His help, while showing love, mercy, and unconditional forgiveness to everyone else.<br>

This is what He was, and still is, teaching His disciples. It is the Holy Spirit’s job to convict people of their sin (John 16:8). Jesus, and those who follow Him, should spend time with those who have been convicted of their sin, teaching them from the Scriptures about the love, grace, mercy, and forgiveness of God. Fishers of men cast their nets where the fish are most hungry. <br>Those sinners who were considered to be outside the boundaries of God’s love and concern are the very ones to whom Jesus has been sent.<p>
