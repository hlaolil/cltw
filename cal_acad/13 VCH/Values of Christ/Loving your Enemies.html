Loving your Enemies
 </h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
“You have heard that it was said, "You shall love your neighbour and hate your enemy". But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet your brethren only, what do you do more than others? Do not even the tax collectors do so?  Therefore you shall be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect. (Matt 5:43-48)</font></p>
<h3>
Introduction
</h3>
<p>
Jesus once again challenges the Pharisees' misunderstanding of the law, and calls for a hard and necessary stand in response to evil, but doing so with goodness and kindness instead of a desire to get even.<br> When our tendency is to respond back in kind, evil for evil, we will only escalate the situation. Thus, when we take this stand with kindness, we may turn an enemy into a friend. In addition, when we do this, we become superior to the enemy in virtue and standing with God. When we respond in the same way as we are harmed, we become as they are, heinous in His sight! <br> 
Because we are children of God, we must always measure ourselves on what we say and do on the basis of who we are in Christ. We must mirror His precepts and character, not what others may say or what we desire.<br> In so doing, we become perfect, as being complete in Him. </p> 
<h3>
You shall love your neighbour 
</h3>
<p>
Jesus is challenging the teachers of the law, who have twisted what the law said and contorted it to their will and means. The Scribes and Pharisees would have lavish debates on defining a neighbour, to whom they could be kind, and to whom they could be mean. In so doing, their responsibility to do as God called was negated as they changed the rules and definitions of God's call, teaching false conclusions. Jesus saw this as heinous and evil.<br> Jesus answers their question of, who is my neighbour, in the Parable of the Good Samaritan  (Luke 10:29-37).</p>
<p>
We are never to contort God's Word to fit our agenda!</p>
<p>
Nowhere in the OT does it say to hate your enemies <br>(Ex 23:4-5; Lev 19:17-18; Prov 25:21-22).<br>
The law taught that kindness was to be shown to your enemy <br>(Ex 23:4-5; Prov 25:21-22).<br>
Some took Psa 139:19-22 as an excuse; however, in context, the request is clearly for those who are wicked. Yes, there were times God called the Jews to attack to take their land, defend themselves, and wipe out sin.<br> However, the focus is always on peace, love, and reconciliation.</p>
<p> 
The Essenes (the writers of the Dead Sea Scrolls) taught the piousness of hating those outside of God's will and covenant. And, the Greeks during Jesus times taught that we are to learn from our enemies, as did the classic book on warfare and tactics, The Art of War, by Suzi, written between 700 and 200 years before Christ.  Yet, many taught then, as is taught today, to get your enemies back harder than they got you.</p>
<p>
Jesus calls us to do the opposite of your feelings and the ways of the world. He said to love them back instead of seeking revenge and payback (Luke 6:32-33). Jesus continually warns us of persecution (Matt 5:10-12; 10:16-32; 24:9-13).<br>
We are to love them in all the characters of love (1 Cor 13:4-8). <br>Love is measured by what is costs us, not what we get from it!</p>
<p>
We are to bless them; this is also a form of love that shows kindness and self-giving from the teachings, examples, character of, and ways that Jesus acted to those who persecuted Him.</p>
<p> 
We are to pray for them, not about them. This means we do not pray that God gets them back, rather that He changes their hearts toward Him and His perfect Will. This was going further that the most pious OT saints did <br>(2 Chron 24:22; Psa 137: 7-9; Jer 11:20; 15:15; 17:18: 18:23).</p>
<p> 
Prov 25:21-22 tells us that when we overcome evil with good, it totally disorientates those who hurt us, sending them into chaos and confusion, until they are convicted or fall deeper into sin and death. This should give you a wake up call that this is the best revenge; let their own misdeeds haunt them, and let the perfect Judge deal with them!</p>
<p>
Most Jews did not consider Gentiles as neighbours, so they treated them with contempt, the opposite of OT precepts. They were not to be influenced by them or inter-marry with them, but they still had a responsibility to proclaim the Word of God to the World (Gen 12:1-3).</p>
 <h3>
Being Sons of the Father
</h3>
<p>
Sons of the Father means we are to demonstrate ourselves to be truly His children (Luke 6:35-36; Rom 5:8,10; Eph 4:31-5:2; 1 John 4:10-11)!</p>
<h3>
Keeping yourself Pure and Holy
</h3>
<p> 
Tax collectors were considered the wickedest people, as they often were Jews preying upon other Jews, extorting money and land for foreign powers (in Jesus time the Romans), while keeping a good deal or most of it themselves.<br>
There is a fine line between building relationships with neighbours, while keeping ourselves pure and holy.<br>
We are called to stay away from pagans, from imitating their bad influences (Duet 18:9; Jer. 10:2).</p>
<h3>
Following God's Standard of Perfection 
</h3>
<p>
Perfect means complete or whole, lacking nothing, with the aspect of being merciful (Luke 6:36).<br>
This, in context, is calling us to fulfil verses Luke 6:21-47 into our lives.<br> This is a call to application and commitment.<br>
Be perfect is God's call for us to follow His character. It is seeking His standards, and not our own, as the Jewish leaders did. When we strive for His perfection, we will exhibit love and benevolent grace even to our enemies. <br>Our Father shows kindness to evil and unthankful people! We may never live up to God's purity because of our sinful nature, but one day we will in eternity. Our goal is to continue to strive for perfection (Phil 3:10-13). However, never use eternity as an excuse to do nothing in developing your character, because character is the one thing you earn and build that will go with you into heaven!</p>
<h3>
A Call to be Holy
</h3>
<p>
The Bible elsewhere calls us to be holy as He is holy <br>(Lev 11:44-45; 19:2; 20:26).</p>
<h3>
Perfection comes from Imitation of God 
</h3>
<p>
In classic Judaism and Greek philosophy, Ethics is the imitation and application of God's character.<br>

Perfection comes when we squeeze out all of our preconceived ideas, interests, wants, and desires, and yield ourselves over to Him, so that we are following His purpose, which is perfect, and not our own, which is flawed. To be God's servant allows Him to be glorified from your walk in Him. To rely on His plan, which is more creative, and has better options than we could ever conceive should be our goal.</p>
