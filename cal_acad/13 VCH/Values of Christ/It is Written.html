<h3>
They knew about God but didn't know Him 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify of Me.” (John 5:39)</font>
The Jewish leaders of Jesus’ day had a great respect for the Scriptures, but they were in the ditch. In spite of their diligent and serious studies in the Word of God, they had become avid advocates of the letter of the Law and were totally oblivious to its spirit.<br> They had a fixation on letters and words, which blinded them to the bigger picture of Divine intent and meaning. <br>They knew the text, but they didn’t know God.</p>
<p>
This was Jesus’ assessment of their situation, and John records the encounter in the fifth chapter of his Gospel. Jesus had just healed a crippled man on the Sabbath, and the Jews were angry at what He had done. From their perspective, healing on the Sabbath was a desecration of the Law of God, and was deserving of the penalty of death. John summarised their reaction by saying,<br> <font color= "blue">“For this reason the Jews persecuted Jesus, and sought to kill Him, because He had done these things on the Sabbath.” (John 5:16)</font>.</p>
<p>
Jesus responded to the Jews by giving a defence of who He was, and by what authority He had healed the man. In essence He told them that they were mistaken in their evaluation of what had happened because they didn’t know God and they didn’t know the Scriptures. It was a surprising accusation.<br> These were the teachers of Israel, and Jesus was saying that they were ignorant in the very area in which they prided themselves as having expertise. <br>They were Bible scholars—but they didn’t know the Bible. In the conclusion of His indictment against the Jews, Jesus challenged them to go back to the Scriptures and observe what they had missed.<br> He said, <font color= "blue">“You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify of Me. But you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.” (John 5:39-40)</font>.</p>
<p>
Jesus was saying that Bible study is not enough. In other words, there is no value in Bible study if the purpose for which God gave the Bible is neglected.<br> In these verses John records Jesus as saying that the purpose of the Scriptures is to testify of Christ and to lead people to come to Him for life. <br>Therefore, people who seek a relationship with Jesus through the study of God’s Word are on the road of God’s purpose. Those who study the Bible without a living relationship with Christ, on the other hand, are off the track in the ditch. <br>Furthermore, those individuals who try to have a relationship with Christ without a careful study of the Scriptures have gotten off the road and are in the other ditch.</p>
<p>
So, what were the Jews doing? They were studying the Word of God as though the adoration of Scripture was an end in itself. Jesus said to them, <font color= "blue">“You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; ...” (John 5:39) </font><br>The Jew's idea was that if they gave themselves arduously and devotedly to the Scriptures, they would be the recipients of eternal life. That’s what they thought—the Scripture, in and of itself, was the key to life.</p>
<p>
Leon Morris, in his commentary on John, quotes Hillel, the celebrated Jewish teacher of Jesus’ day, as saying, “the more study of the Law, the more life… if he has gained for himself words of the Law he has gained for himself life in the world to come.” The Jews were, in fact, so committed to reverencing the very letters of Scripture that they took it to an extreme. Again Leon Morris quotes the great archaeologist, Frederic Kenyon as saying that the Scribes “numbered the verses, words, and letters of every book. They calculated the middle word and the middle letter of each. They enumerated verses which contained all the letters of the alphabet, or a certain number of them.” It was adoration taken to the extreme of veneration. They had turned Bible study into Bible worship, and they were guilty of bibliolatry.</p>
<p>
Of course we can be guilty of the same extreme. Bible study can become a substitute for the true worship of God in Christ. A perfunctory approach to devotions, Scripture memory, discipleship, services of worship and Sunday sermons can desensitise us to the importance of a living daily relationship with Christ. We can feel sanctimonious about having put in our time with God, without ever grasping the joy of truly communing with Christ. <br>As John Peter Lange put it, we can “[idolise] the written book” while at the same time resisting “the living word contained therein.”</p>
<p>
We are seeking to be sensitive to this balance. The Reformation of the sixteenth century was significant for more than just Sola Scriptura (Scripture alone). <br>It was equally concerned about the importance of Solus Christus (Christ alone), as well as Sola Fide (faith alone), Sola Gratia (grace alone) and Soli Deo Gloria (glory to God alone). To emphasise the importance of Scripture as the source of all truth without also stressing the essential aspect of Christ as the source of all life, is to go off the track into the ditch. It is to be off balance and to be guilty of bibliolatry.</p>
 <h3>
Scripture is a Testimony of Christ
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“... and these are they which testify of Me.”</font>
That is essentially what Jesus was saying to the Jewish leaders concerning the nature of Scripture. <font color= "blue">“You search the Scriptures, ... and these are they which testify of Me.” (John 5:39)</font>.<br> He was not saying that the Scriptures were unimportant or that the Jews were wrong in revering them. The point He was making is that they were missing the point. They had failed to see the Person behind the letter. It was not that Jesus was unrecognisable as the One of whom the Scriptures spoke.<br>
Moses had written of the ultimate Prophet to come, who would be like him<br> (Deut 18:15-19), and Philip had recognised that Jesus was that Prophet <br>(John 1:45).<br> Others also saw through His humble peasant garb and infamous Nazareth roots to worship Him as the long awaited Messiah, the Son of God. <br>It’s just that the Jewish leaders had become blinded to who Jesus was, by their diversion into an obsession with the letter of the Law. They had substituted form for substance, and had lost any sense of spiritual meaning.<br> Jesus stood before them as the clear fulfilment of Scripture, and they simply continued to count letters and words.</p>
<p>
A Christ-centred study of Scripture is fundamental to a correct understanding of the Bible. Consider the comment of John Calvin on this text. He said, ... We ought to believe that Christ cannot be properly known in any other way than from the Scriptures; and if it be so, it follows that we ought to read the Scriptures with the express design of finding Christ in them. Whoever shall turn aside from this object, though he may weary himself throughout his whole life in learning, will never attain the knowledge of the truth; ...</p>
<p>
Any biblical hermeneutic (principles of interpreting the Bible) that does not have at its core a Christocentric focus is merely a mechanical approach to Scripture. The Word of God is <font color= "blue">“living and powerful” (Heb 4:12)</font> because it throbs with the life of Christ. He is the essence of Scripture, and the grand purpose of Scripture is to testify of Him.</p>
<p>
When Jesus had a Bible study with two Emmaus disciples after His crucifixion and resurrection, Luke records the event by telling us, <font color= "blue">“And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.” (Luke 24:27)</font>. <br>Later that evening in Jerusalem, Jesus had another Bible study with most of the disciples and a few other believers who were gathered in a private room.<br> Luke again tells us what He said:<font color= "blue"> “Then He said to them, “These are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms concerning Me.” And He opened their understanding, that they might comprehend the Scriptures. (Luke 24:44-45)</font><br> The point here is that even the disciples of Jesus did not understand their Old Testament Scriptures until they saw them in a Christocentric light.<br> Neither can we understand our Bible until we see Jesus as the focus and fulfilment of Bible study. To study the Bible without communing with Jesus in the process, is to miss the point of Bible study.</p>
 <h3>
Only in Jesus is there Life
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“... you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life.” (John 5:40)</font><br>
The Jews were serious about their study of the Scriptures. They had a zeal for God which was nothing less than fanatical. Over the years they had gotten the idea that the blessings of the Lord were a reward for diligence in the observance of the externals of their religion. The more devoted they were to the laws and rituals of Judaism, the more honour they thought they would receive from God. Consequently, every letter of the Sacred Text became an object of devotion. They had a near-sighted obsession with minutiae. For them, it was the way to God.</p>
<p>
This was the background of Jesus’ remark when He said to them, <font color= "blue">“... you think that in them you have eternal life” (John 5:39)</font>. That is exactly what they thought. But they were mistaken. There is no life in the Scriptures by themselves. Jesus went on to say, <font color= "blue">“... you are not willing to come to Me that you may have life” (John 5:40)</font>. Jesus was standing before them as God, but they were wilfully refusing to acknowledge Him. What they needed to understand was that they were not only rejecting Him, they were turning their backs on life.</p>
<p>
Life comes from God, not from words in a book. Even God’s words are only vehicles of communication. The words live because they come from God, who is life. That is the point. Life is in the God of the Word, not in the Word of God. This is not a subtle distinction—it is a basic observation of how things are. When John wrote his first Epistle, he was careful to conclude with a strong statement of this very truth.<br> As if using an exclamation point, he said, <font color= "blue"> And this is the testimony: that God has given us eternal life, and this life is in His Son. He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life. (1 John 5:11-12)</font><br>
This, then, is what Jesus was saying to the Jewish leaders.<br> Scriptures are clear about the fact that life is from God and that eternal life is in the hands of the Son of God. Yet, the Jews had failed to grasp this significant truth. They were ignorant of the Scriptures, and blinded to the fact that the giver of eternal life was in their very midst!<br> Therefore, they failed to come to Him that they might have life.</p>
<p>
Is it possible that we could also be off balance in this regard? Our theology of eternal life may be correct—that salvation is only to be found in Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Yet, our daily relationship with Christ as the source of all life may be skewed. We can correctly see Him as our ultimate hope and still miss the fact that He is our present joy. We can get caught up in the religion of Christianity and at the same time not have fellowship with Jesus. <br>We can pride ourselves in Bible study and be oblivious to the fact that Jesus is in our midst. <br>We too, can find ourselves in the ditch and off balance.</p>
<p>
So, with a commitment to Sola Scriptura (Scripture alone), how do we avoid the ditch of bibliolatry (worship of the Bible)? The answer is to recognise the equally important truth of Solus Christus (Christ alone). In our reading and study of the Bible, we need to worship Jesus and commune with Him.<br> Scripture memory and discipleship studies must be rooted in a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. Sunday morning sermons need to be listened to with an ear for the voice of Christ that overwhelms the voice of the preacher. We must be equally devoted to both Sola Scriptura and Solus Christus. <br>We find truth in the Scriptures, but we find life in Christ. Balance is the key.</p>
<p>As you study your Bible with the help of the Holy Spirit, and live out the truths that God reveals to you, you will discover new stability, strength, and confidence. </p>
