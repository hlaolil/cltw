Living as Salt
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
"You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavour, how shall it be seasoned? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled underfoot by men. (Matt 5:13)</font></p>
<p>
Jesus' teaching on salt follows hard on the heels of the Beatitudes, which closes extolling the blessedness of those who are persecuted for Jesus' sake.<br> Together, the Beatitudes and the Parable of Salt form a kind of profile of the Spirit-filled disciple.</p>
<p>
Some have been persecuted for silent protest. But many more have been vilified for declaring the Good News by both their deeds and their words.<br> Jesus doesn't restrict our witness to words only or deeds only.<br> Together they comprise the blessing of uncompromising witness.</p>
<p>
In (Matt 5:13) Jesus tells a simple parable and draws conclusions from it.<br> Using parables was a characteristic teaching method for Jesus. <br>He chose a simple concept -- salt -- and expounded from it principles for living.</p>
<h3>
Salty Christians 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt loses its saltiness, how can it be made salty again? It is no longer good for anything, except to be thrown out and trampled by men." (Matt 5:13)</font><br>
"Salty Christians" almost sounds like a serving of "fish and chips."<br> Salty Christians, Jesus tells us emphatically, are much to be preferred over the salt-free variety.</p>
<p>
A proper amount of salt (sodium chloride, NaCl) is essential to sustain life, so ancient peoples traded whatever was required to obtain it.<br> In Israel, most salt came from salt caves in the area around the Dead Sea.<br> Both ancient and modern peoples have used salt as both:<br>
(1) a food preservative, and <br>
(2) to bring out the flavour of foods (Job 6:6; Col 4:6).<br> 
It was also used to make covenants and mixed with sacrifices.
<h3>
Salt as a Preservative
</h3>
<p>
So what does it mean to be the salt of the earth? If we use the preservative analogy, we would say that Christians by their very presence help preserve the world and hold back the wrath of God against it. I believe that God's mercy on our sinful world is due to the prayers and presence of the saints on earth. Abraham argued with God over the fate of Sodom and Gomorrah, <font color= "blue">"Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"</font> he asked. <font color= "blue">"Would You also destroy the righteous with the wicked?" </font>And God answered, <font color= "blue">"I will not destroy it for the sake of ten." (Gen 18:25,23,32)</font>.</p>
<p>
But our presence is not only a shield against the wrath of God upon the earth. We also serve as those who by their wholesome presence bring about change and healing in a corrupt society. 
Christians are the salt of the earth.<br> Their influence is wholesome and good and healing.
Who today stand for the life of the unborn child? Christians. Catholic Christians and Protestant Christians together. Yes, it is an embattled position, but it is right. And Christians can serve as the conscience of the nation today as they have in the past.</p>
<p>
While it is true that ancient peoples used salt as a preservative, a search of the Bible for this use of salt comes up empty. 
The closest we come in the canonical scriptures was the use of salt to render land unusable (Judges 9:45), the rubbing of newborns with salt (to purify them? Ezek 16:4), or Elisha's use of salt to sweeten or purify a spring and remove its poison (2 Kings 2:20-21).</p>
<h3>
Salt as a Seasoning
</h3>
<p>
There is much more evidence in the Bible of salt being used as seasoning, and in the parable we are studying, Jesus seems to be referring more to salt's taste than its effects.<br>

Salt was used with sacrifices as a way of honouring the King to whom the sacrifices were made (Lev 2:13; Ezra 6:9; Ezek 43:24). Salt was used in the making of covenants (Num 18:19). We read of its ability to add flavour to food (Job 6:6), and Paul writes,</p>
<p>
<font color= "blue">
"Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how to answer everyone" (Col 4:6)</font>.</p>
<p>
Here, as in Jesus' parable of Christians being the salt of the earth, salt has to do with witness and conversation. In Col 4:6 it is used with the Greek word artuo, "to add condiments to something, to season, to salt."

I believe that the primary meaning of "You are the salt of the earth" has to do with a willingness to live our lives with the "tang" of our faith intact. We're under so much pressure to give up our differences and blend in with society. Believers are to be "tangy" rather than bland and insipid in the way we live and speak.</p>
<p>
The salt the Israelites obtained was often impure, mixed with alkali salts from around the Dead Sea. Water could leach out the sodium chloride, leaving the other salts intact, so that it looked like salt but tasted insipid.<br> This seems to be the basis of Jesus' warning about salt losing its saltiness.<br> The essential Christ-inspired difference in our lives can be leached out by the constant flow of the world's values through our lives.</p>
<p>
We can come to the point where we have given up our standards and now stand for nothing. We may disguise it by saying that the zeal of youth has been tempered with the wisdom of maturity, but that is only a partial excuse. Someone once phrased the issue this way: If you were being tried for being for being a Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you?<br>

If we no longer stand boldly and faithfully for Christ and Christian values, we become worthless to him. Less than worthless, in fact, since by our mild claims of our Christianity we act as a counterfeit of the real salt.<br> Worthless, insipid, tangy-less salt is good for nothing except for throwing on the pathway to keep the grass from growing on it. Would you rather be a grass killer or a food enhancer?</p>
