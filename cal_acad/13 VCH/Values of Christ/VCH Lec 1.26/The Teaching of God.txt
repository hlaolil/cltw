The Teaching of God

<h2>
Jesus is the True and Righteous One
</h2>
<h3>
Jesus was sent here by God
</h3>
<p>
Jesus emphasises this twice here. <font color= "blue">Jesus answered them and said, “My doctrine is not Mine, but His who sent Me.” (John 7:16)</font>, and, <font color= "blue">“ He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who seeks the glory of the One who sent Him is true, and no unrighteousness is in Him.” (John 7:18)</font> He mentions it again,<font color= "blue"> “I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know. I know Him, for I am from Him and He sent Me.” (John 7:28-29)</font>. It is a major theme in John that Jesus is the one sent to earth by God the Father.</p>
<p>
Why did Jesus emphasise this so often? It’s a matter of His pre-existence and authority. If He was a religious upstart, who came up with His own ideas and promoted Himself alone, then why believe in Him? But if the one true God sent Him and He is also true, then we had better believe in Him and obey Him. To reject Jesus is to reject the God who sent Him.</p>
<h3>
Jesus taught God’s truth 
</h3>
<p>
Jesus did not go up to the feast with His brothers to make a grand entrance, because the people wanted to make Him a political king. But sometime in the midst of the feast, He went into the temple and began to teach. A crowd quickly gathered around Him. Probably, the charge in John 7:15 is coming from the Jewish leaders and addressed to the people listening to Jesus. Their “astonishment” did not mean that they were favourably impressed by Jesus’ teaching. Rather, they were amazed at His audacity to take on the role of a religious teacher in the temple when He lacked the proper credentials from the Jewish authorities. They were trying to discredit Jesus in front of the crowd by alleging that “this man” (a derogatory term) purports to be learned, but He has never been educated in our schools. John is again using irony: Here are these proud Jewish leaders calling the eternal Word who created the world (John 1:1-3) an uneducated fellow!</p>
<p>
Jesus responds to their challenge by asserting, “My doctrine is not Mine, but His who sent Me.” (John 7:16) Jesus is saying, “I don’t need your education and humanly-conferred degrees because I am speaking truth directly from the living and true God who sent Me here to teach.” In spiritual matters, the ideas of philosophers and religious teachers are mere speculation. Such thinkers have not come from God and they can only guess at what He is like. But since Jesus came from God, He could authoritatively teach us about God, man, sin, and how we can have eternal life.</p>
<p>
Note what Jesus says about how a person can know whether His teaching originated with Him or with God: <font color= "blue">“If anyone wills to do His will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is from God or whether I speak on My own authority.” (John 7:17)<font> When you’re witnessing to an unbeliever about Christ, you should challenge him to read the gospels, paying attention to the teaching of Jesus. But many have read and even studied the gospels and come away as unbelievers. The key is to tell the unbeliever, “As you read, tell God that if He will show you that Jesus is true, you will be willing to obey Him.” If the person comes to the gospels as a scoffer, he will read them and go away a scoffer. If he comes with a willing heart to obey God’s will, then God will show him the truth about Jesus.</p>
<h3>
Jesus sought God’s glory 
</h3>
<p>
Jesus continues: <font color= "blue">“He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but He who seeks the glory of the One who sent Him is true, and no unrighteousness is in Him.” (John 7:18)</font> When Jesus came to this earth, He voluntarily laid aside the glory that He had shared with the Father from all eternity and took on the form of a slave, becoming obedient even to death on the cross (Phil. 2:6-8). He is now risen, ascended, and restored to His rightful full glory at the Father’s right hand (John 17:5). He will come again in power and glory to judge the living and the dead.</p>
<p>
But when He was on earth, Jesus’ aim was to glorify the Father. He states that this, not rabbinic credentials from the accredited schools, is the test of a true teacher. That is true of all who purport to teach God’s truth: If a man glories in his academic degrees and seeks to exalt himself, he is not a true teacher of God’s truth. When you have any idea of the righteousness and majesty of God, you’ll be painfully aware of your own inadequacy and unworthiness. You’ll cry out, <font color= "blue">“Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to Your name give glory, because of Your mercy, because of Your truth” (Psa 115:1)</font>

Thus Jesus is true and righteous because He was sent here by God, He taught God’s truth, and He sought God’s glory. </p>
<h3>
Jesus God’s miraculous works 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Did not Moses give you the Law, and yet none of you keeps the Law? Why do you seek to kill Me?" The people answered, "You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill You?" Jesus answered and said to them, "I did one work, and you all marvel. Moses therefore gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers),and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath. If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the Law of Moses should not be broken, are you angry with Me because I made a man completely well on the Sabbath?" (John 7:19-23)</font> 

Jesus draws a contrast between Himself and the hypocritical Pharisees. There was no unrighteousness in Jesus (John 7:18), but the Jews, who boasted in the Law, didn’t actually keep the Law, as seen by the fact that they were trying to kill Jesus. The crowd, which consisted of Jews from all over Israel as well as from other countries, may not have been aware of the evil intent of their leaders. So they accuse Jesus of demon-induced paranoia.</p>
<p>
Jesus responds (John 7:21) by referring back to the incident in John 5:1-15, where He healed the man by the Pool of Bethesda and told him to carry his mat on the Sabbath. As a result of this one deed, the Jews were persecuting Him and seeking to kill Him (John 5:16,18). It’s not easy to understand what “for this reason” (John 7:22) refers to, but the thought seems to be, “The reason Moses gave you the law that requires circumcising a baby on the eighth day even if that day is the Sabbath is that he was pleading My cause in advance. Moses was requiring you to commit the same Sabbath transgression that you are seeking to kill Me for. If it’s lawful to purify one part of the body by circumcision on the Sabbath, then why was it wrong for Me to heal an entire man on the Sabbath?”</p>
<p>
But the point is, as Nicodemus told Jesus,<font color= "blue">
“No one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him.” (John 3:2)</font>
Or, as the man born blind whom Jesus healed told the hostile Jewish leaders, <font color= "blue">“If this Man were not from God, He could do nothing.” (John 9:33)</font> Or, as Jesus tells the same religious leaders , <font color= "blue">“If I do not do the works of My Father, do not believe Me; but if I do, though you do not believe Me, believe the works, that you may know and believe that the Father is in Me, and I in Him.” (John 10:37-38)</font>

So there is solid evidence for believing that Jesus is the true and righteous one: He was sent here by God; He taught God’s truth; He sought God’s glory; and He did God’s miraculous works. So, with all this evidence, why do people still reject Jesus as Saviour and Lord?</p>
<h2>
People reject Jesus because of their many sins.
</h2>
<p>
The text reveals five sins that caused these religious Jews to reject Jesus.</p>
<h3>
People reject Jesus because they value the wrong things 
</h3>
<p>
As we’ve seen, these Jewish leaders valued their rabbinic training. They had a “old boys club” of those who had graduated from their schools. When they taught in the synagogues and in the temple, the rabbis would cite the proper rabbinic authorities. But here was this young upstart from the insignificant town of Nazareth teaching the people without citing the esteemed rabbis. He would say, <font color= "blue">“You have heard that it was said, ... but I say to you” (see Matt 5:21-22, 27-28, 31-32, 38-39, 43-44)</font>. Matthew 7 concludes the Sermon on the Mount by noting, <font color= "blue">“And so it was, when Jesus had ended these sayings, that the people were astonished at His teaching,for He taught them as one having authority, and not as the scribes.” (Matt 7:28-29)</font>

While there is nothing wrong per se with academic degrees, if we put such a premium on degrees that we disregard or belittle a godly man who lacks such degrees, we will miss some deep spiritual blessings. John Bunyan, the author of Pilgrim’s Progress, did not have any formal training, but he had deep insight into the Bible and he could preach it with power. The king of England once asked John Owen, the learned Puritan theologian who was the Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University, how he could go and listen to a tinker prate (Bunyan’s trade was to fix pots and pans). Owen replied, “May it please your majesty, could I possess the tinker’s ability for preaching, I would willingly relinquish all my learning.” If we value the wrong things, we will miss Jesus.</p>
<h3>
People reject Jesus because they are not willing to obey God 
</h3>
<p>
We’ve already looked at John 7:17,<font color= "blue"> “If anyone wills to do His will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is from God or whether I speak on My own authority.”</font> But note further what Jesus is saying here: The reason that people do not recognise Jesus for who He is does not hinge on having enough evidence, but rather on having enough obedience. If a person is willing to obey God, he will know that Jesus was sent by God and speaks God’s truth. As Augustine put it “Do not seek to understand in order to believe, but believe that you may understand.”</p>
<p>
In other words, if you come to the Bible as a scoffer, you’ll go away a scoffer. <font color= "blue">"But Jesus did not commit Himself to them, because He knew all men,(John 2:24)</font>. That’s a basic principle of human relationships. If someone comes to you with a critical, hostile attitude, you’re not going to commit yourself to him. But if he comes wanting to be of help to you, you’re more likely to open yourself up to him. Similarly, Jesus said, <font color= "blue">“He who has My commandments and keeps them is he who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and manifest Myself to him.” (John 14:21)</font> The opposite is also true: If you don’t obey Christ, He won’t disclose Himself to you.</p>
<h3>
People reject Jesus because they are legalistic hypocrites 
</h3>
<p>
The Jewish leaders prided themselves on obeying the Mosaic Law, but Jesus unmasks them by stating, “Did not Moses give you the Law, and yet none of you keeps the Law? Why do you seek to kill Me?” (John 7:19) The scribes and Pharisees meticulously tithed their table spices, but they neglected the weightier provisions of the law (Matt 23:23). Here, they want to break the sixth commandment by killing Jesus. Legalism is when a person keeps certain man made rules or parts of God’s Word that he can do externally, so that everyone will notice how “righteous” he is. But he doesn’t deal with the sin in his heart.</p>
<p>
Since the Lord knows every private thought that you have, it’s foolish to try to put on an outward show of “righteousness,” while at the same time you neglect judging sinful thoughts, such as pride, greed, lust, selfishness, and jealousy. You may impress others, but God isn’t impressed at all! Legalistic hypocrisy will cause you to reject Jesus, the righteous one, who sees right through you.</p>
<h3>
People reject Jesus because they are under satanic influence 
</h3>
<p>
The crowd may have been ignorant of the leaders intent to kill Jesus, but their response of accusing Jesus of having a demon was evidence that they themselves were under demonic influence. Since they thought that mental illnesses, such as paranoia, stemmed from demonic activity, they may have only been accusing Jesus of being crazy. But, still, to charge the true and righteous one of having a demon can only come from satanic influence.</p>
<p>
It’s interesting that in John, there are no stories of Jesus casting out demons, as in the Synoptic Gospels, but there are several occasions where Jesus is accused of being demon-possessed (John 8:48-52; John 10:20-21). The apostle tells us, <font color= "blue">“We know that we are of God, and  the whole world lies under the sway of the wicked one.” (1 John 5:19)<font> Or, as Paul states with reference to those who are perishing, <font color= "blue">whose minds the god of this age has blinded, who do not believe, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine on them.” (2 Cor 4:4)</font> For people to receive Christ, the Holy Spirit must open their eyes to see something of His glory.</p>
<p>
Thus, people reject Jesus in spite of who He is because they value the wrong things, they are not willing to obey God, they are legalistic hypocrites, and they are under satanic influence. </p>
<h3>
People reject Jesus because they judge according to outward appearances
</h3>
<p> 
<font color= "blue">
Jesus exhorts these scoffers, “Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgement.” (John 7:24)</font> The Greek here may be translated, “Stop judging according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment.” They were judging Jesus because He healed a man and told him to carry his mat on the Sabbath, which was a violation of their legalistic additions to the Sabbath commandment. But at the same time, they were rejecting the true and righteous one and seeking to kill Him!</p>
<p>
Perhaps one of the most misunderstood and misapplied verses in the New Testament is Jesus’ command, <font color= "blue">“Judge not, that you be not judged.” (Matt 7:1)</font> If people would bother to read just a few verses further, Jesus commands not to throw your pearls before swine (He was talking about people who are swine, not pigs!). He goes on to warn about wolves in sheep’s clothing. Obviously, to obey those commands you have to make some judgements! The Bible commands us to be discerning with regard to false teaching and demonic activity (Pastoral Epistles; 1 John 4:1).</p>
<p>
The point here is that if you judge who Jesus is superficially, you’ll end up rejecting Him as He really is. There are many who think that Jesus was always gentle, kind, and nice. I’m not sure how that myth ever got started! Read the Gospels and you’ll see Jesus strongly confront sin, as He is doing here. You can’t trust in Him and walk with Him without Him confronting your sin. He always does it in love, because sin destroys us. But He does confront it. If you truly believe in Jesus, you will let His Word confront your sin regularly.</p>
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
That brings me back to John 7:17 again. If you want to know who Jesus is and whether He is the true and righteous one, sent by God, you have to be willing to obey God’s will as revealed in His word. The Danish philosopher Soren Kierkegaard wrote, “It is difficult for us to believe because it is difficult for us to obey.” If you’re willing to obey, God will show you that Jesus is God’s true and righteous one. He is worthy of all your trust!</p>
