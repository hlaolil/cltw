Jesus wept
</h1>
<p>
Jesus wept because of man’s sin and the death it brought.<br>
Jesus delayed visiting Lazarus when he was sick, knowing that Lazarus would die. Though He could have healed Lazarus (even from a distance), He told His disciples that He was glad He was not there. Jesus anticipated the Resurrection that He would perform as a sign to His disciples, that they might believe <br>(John 11:11–15).</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Therefore, when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled. And He said, “Where have you laid him?” They said to Him, “Lord, come and see.” Jesus wept. <br>(John 11:33–35) </font>
<p>
But when Jesus arrived in Bethany and saw the family and friends of Lazarus grieving, why did Jesus weep? He certainly knew that Lazarus would soon be alive again—it was for this purpose that He had come to Bethany.<br> Clearly Jesus was affected by the grief of his close friend Mary and the rest of the Jews who were lamenting with her and Martha.<br> When we read that we are to weep with those who weep (Rom 12:15), we can clearly see that our Lord and Saviour demonstrated that kind of empathy here.</p>
<p>
But we read further in John 11:35–38 that Jesus was weeping and still groaning within Himself, this time in response to death itself and the disbelief of the people. Jesus had told Martha that Lazarus would rise again, and many of the Jews there had probably seen Jesus perform miracles, yet they questioned why He hadn’t prevented one of His dearest friends from dying.<br> Jesus knew that some would believe on Him from this moment on, but many would still disbelieve and even report His miracle to the Pharisees.<br> Just as in the example from Luke 16:19–31, there were some who would not believe even though they saw a man rise from the dead.</p>
<p>
Although John 11:35 does not tell us specifically why Jesus wept, we can infer one reason from the context: Jesus was grieved over death as the result of mankind’s sin. <br>At the beginning of creation, <font color= "blue">“the Lord God commanded the man, saying, "Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat; but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die” (Gen 2:16–17)</font>.<br> Because Adam directly disobeyed this command, God punished all humanity beginning with Adam: <font color= "blue">“In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; for dust you are, and to dust you shall return” (Gen 3:19)</font>.</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul confirmed the correlation between sin and death:<font color= "blue"> “Therefore, just as through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned” (Rom 5:12)</font>.<br> Paul also clearly wrote that <font color= "blue">“the wages of sin is death” in Rom 6:23.</font><p>
<p>
As Christians, we often forget that death is an enemy.<br> While it is true that when a fellow believer dies we do not sorrow as those who have no hope (1 Thess 4:13), we nevertheless must remember that death is unnatural. It is not what God created, but came about because of Adam’s sin and rebellion. Let us remember and find hope in Paul’s description of a time to come when death will be no more:
<br><font color= "blue">
For He must reign till He has put all enemies under His feet. The last enemy that will be destroyed is death.(1 Cor 15:25–26)</font> <br><font color= "blue">So when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: “Death is swallowed up in victory.” “O Death, where is your sting? O Hades, where is your victory?” The sting of death is sin, and the strength of sin is the law.<br> (1 Cor 15:54–56)</font><br>
In raising Lazarus, Jesus showed a small glimpse of this ultimate defeat of death. Jesus had the power to raise the dead, and soon thereafter He went to the Cross to defeat death permanently. Death has been defeated (2 Tim 1:10), and one day it will be destroyed forever (Rev 20:14).</p>
<p>
The account of Jesus weeping at the graveside of Lazarus is most likely another example of God’s grief over our sin. Jesus knew some would not believe. <br>He knew that the Pharisees would now plot even harder to kill Him. <br>He knew that everyone there (including Lazarus again) would physically die as a result of Adam’s sin and their own sin. Although He was headed to Calvary to become the sacrifice for our sin, He still knew that the consequences would continue until the time He presents <font color= "blue">“a new heaven and a new earth” (Rev 21:1).</font></p>
