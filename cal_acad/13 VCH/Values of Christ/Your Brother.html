   <h1>
Your Brother ...
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
You have heard that it was said to those of old, "You shall not murder,and whoever murders will be in danger of the judgement." But I say to you that whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgement. And whoever says to his brother, "Raca!" shall be in danger of the council. But whoever says, "You fool!" shall be in danger of hell fire.<br> Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar, and go your way. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. <br>(Matt 5:21-24)</font></p>
<h3>
Two Options
</h3>
<p>
There are two options, about what Jesus says in Matthew.  Which of the two you choose makes all the difference. 

The first interpretation is that Jesus is giving us “the Ten Commandments on steroids,” as one commentator called them.<br> We should not murder, but we also can’t be angry. We can’t even show up to make a gift at church unless we’ve first successfully resolved every difference with every person we know. 
<h3>
The Ten Commandments on Steroids!
</h3>
<p>
If Jesus is offering us the Ten Commandments on Steroids, with harsh requirements and harsh penalties, then we’re all doomed. <br>Doomed! Every single one of us. <br>
By those standards, we might not even escape a worship service without hurling ourselves into the fire  – you’re bound to be irritated by something said, or the off hand comment of someone during coffee hour, and then – it’d be hopeless. <br>
Great, we say – so glad I came to church this morning! </p>
<h3>
The Other Way
</h3>
<p>
But there is another way of hearing today’s story: that Jesus is painting a picture of what the beloved community looks like, and inviting us into it. <br> He’s giving us a glimpse of how beautiful human life is meant to be, can be.  <br>

Life where we honour each other.  Where we know that insults hurt, and that spitting out “Stupid!” “Fool” “Idiot” or worse -- even in a flash of anger -– can crush a soul, so we hold back. </p>
<p>
Jesus points today toward a life where we spend more energy affirming others’ value than enumerating their failures.   A life where, when we have hurt another in anger, as will happen because we’re human, we’ll have learned to drop other things, as less important, and just apologise. We’ll do what it takes to reconcile, rather than battling to a litigious win.</p>
<p>
There are two interpretations, when it comes to what Jesus says.<br> Which of the two you choose makes all the difference in whether you think religion is fear-based or loved-based.  Is it built on following the rules perfectly, or in building relationships in a beloved community. <br>

Which interpretation you choose could determine whether religion is worth your time at all.  
<h3>
What did Jesus really mean? 
</h3>
<p>
The “10 Commandments on Steroids” certainly seems like what we’re hearing. 

The rule is not just “Do not murder,” as Moses told the people of old; actually, the rule is that you can never even get angry. Don’t call someone names, and never insult. <br>

And if you “colour within those lines,” you’ll be fine.  But if you don’t, you’re damned to hell. <br>

Quite a few Christians over the years have chosen this interpretation, that Jesus was laying out reality:  we humans can never hope to measure up to God’s impossible standards, so our only hope is to fling ourselves on our knees, begging God’s undeserved mercy. Our prayer book contains some words like these. But is that all Jesus intended, all that our prayer book teaches?
<h3>
Or is there more
</h3>
<p>
Because there is another view. And which you choose makes all the difference. 

The second view recognises that Jesus was teaching the antithesis of “the Ten Commandments on Steroids.” In fact, to understand the Sermon on the Mount as “the Ten Commandments on Steroids” just repeats the rigid, rule-bound religion from which Jesus sought to free us, rules that wouldn’t let Jesus heal a man’s deformed hand because it was the Sabbath. <br>

Under the second view, Jesus wants us to still honour the Sabbath, but to do so by digging down and understanding the intention behind the commandment. The goal of the Sabbath is to give us fuller life, and touching a man’s hand to heal it brings fuller life.</p>
<p>
The intention of the commandment not to murder, says Jesus, is that we deeply value the lives of our fellow humans, despite our differences; that we wake to the fact that each person is made in God’s own image, not just us; that the other is someone whose life we care about, not someone so lacking in value that we could snuff out their life force. <br>

The deeper intention of the commandment against murder is to teach us ways of living together, and seeing each other, that transforms us and them.<br> From enemy into sister.  From opponent into brother, all equally children of God, especially when our interests diverge. </p> 
<h3>
Man's Rules or God's Intention
</h3>
<p>
God’s heart must break each time we in the Christian church have created the Ten Commandments on Steroids.  When, in order to support a "good” thing, like Christian marriage before God, the Church creates this new rule:  we will marry you only if you have never have been divorced, and you love the people we think it’s right for you to love. </p>
<p>
When in order to protect the specialness of Jesus’ gift in a shared meal of communion, the Church creates this new rule:  you can receive communion only if you adhere to our interpretation of God’s love, never get divorced, are free of sin or have adequately confessed.</p>
<p>
Institutional religion, of every stripe, all across the globe, tends to fall into this trap: seeking clarity, we humans set up rules again, like the Ten Commandments on Steroids. Rigid church rules are comforting for many people, lay and clergy alike. Many of us like being told by someone else, “Here are the rules, now follow them.” <br> We like knowing:  As long as I profess these things, it’s all good. </p>
<h3>
How would you size up the two options
</h3>
<p>
In some ways the second interpretation is easier to live because Jesus says, “Life in the beloved community is not built on things you must do, rules you must follow, but on what God already does, right now, all the time: <br>God loves all people unconditionally.<br> 

The only thing for us is to discover the remarkable love God has for us.<br> Because when we are secure in that, we’re transformed into being able to love others with that same generosity. Jesus had found that in His own life, and wanted to share that Good News with us.</p>
<p>
But this second interpretation is harder that mere rule following, because it requires an inner journey, exploring why it’s so hard for us to trust that we really are God’s beloved ones.<br>

When we begin that pilgrimage into a relationship with a God who loves us, and when we “emerge” from this remarkable inner journey, we find we can act with more love and trust toward the world outside.  Not every moment or every day.  But more and more, alongside others in God’s beloved community, here – in this place – with those also on the journey. </p>
<p>
A world built on rules that we’ll inevitably fail to follow perfectly, makes us more self-loathing, as well as more contemptuous of others who can’t comply. <br> We tend to be driven by our fear of failing, and focus on tallies of who did or didn’t do what. With rules, we keep score, win/lose.<br>

But a world built on relationships – yours with God, and yours with others whom God loves –that is a world where we begin to act differently. <br> 

Today’s passage jolts us to imagine what our world could be, were we to honour each other as beloved, blessed.  We don’t try just to avoid murder, but to respect each other. We listen more closely, assuming first that someone may have something worthwhile to share with us. We learn to construe what our neighbour says in the best light instead of in the worst.  We hold another’s welfare close to our hearts, and trust that he/she does the same for us. </p>
<p>
Jesus is radical – not by creating Commandments on Steroids – but by being perhaps the first genuine humanist, according to one theologian – who showed us that humans, when secured by love, when transformed by unconditional acceptance, are capable of good, true and beautiful acts. The reign of God, right here, within us and among us. Now!</p>
<p>
All this has application in that “easiest” of all human relations – marriages!
Relationships fail when we won’t honour what the other person is trying to tell us –rather than really listening to what they’re saying, we immediately get defensive, and retaliate by naming their failures, without actually responding to what they’ve said about our actions. 

We convey that we’re not listening by “stonewalling”:  avoiding eye contract, sitting in stony silence, or walking away.</p>
<p>
Rather than directly complaining about the other person’s actions, we attack the person him or herself.  Instead of “you didn’t get the groceries,” it becomes “you never do what you promise.”   

But the worst, is when we are contemptuous, as if our partner disgusts us.  When we stand in a position of moral superiority and demean them.  When we feel contemptuous, all the research shows, our heart rates increase, our overall health declines, and we cannot even remember any of the admirable things about our partner.  We literally cannot remember why we are in this relationship in the first place. </p>
<p>
So the kinds of conduct towards others that we need to ban from our lives are those that show contempt; we need to ban: insulting our partner, calling them names, mocking them, using hostile humour, or conveying contempt by our facial expressions: sneering, curling our upper lip, rolling our eyes. </p>
<p>
And the key to reversing this damage in a marriage is to learn to reconcile, or manage the inevitable differences between partners, just like the inevitable differences in any community.<br>  

How people do this varies: sometimes we agree to disagree and make light of differences; sometimes we compromise, not getting perfectly what we want, but ensuring that all feel understood and respected. The marriages that last are fundamentally based in an admiration and fondness for one another.<br>  
In marriage, in a church community, in this world, you can try to live either by rigid rules, delineating your rights versus mine, compelling obedience based on our mutual fear of punishment.  Or you can live in a relationship, between you and God, and you and others, built on God’s unconditional love. </p>
<p>
Which of the two you choose comes down to this – the very heart of our passage today.<br> 

Could God ever hold you in contempt?<br> 
If yes, then why would you follow that God?<br>
If no, then why do you ever need to have contempt for someone else? </p>
