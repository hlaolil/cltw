<h1>
It Is Finished 
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
"So when Jesus had received the sour wine, He said, “It is finished!” And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit." (John 19:30)</font></p>
<p>
Jesus' journey had begun in a simple stable in the City of David thirty some years before. Now it was finished.</p>
<h3>
What Did Jesus Come to Accomplish?
</h3>
<p>
What was finished? What was this mission that was now finished? Why did Jesus come? Let's look at how Jesus defined His mission --  and later, how His apostles understood it. We read about His commission to 
<p><font color= "blue">"preach the Gospel to the poor" (Luke 4:18,43)</font>,</p>
<p><font color= "blue">"that they may have life, " (John 10:10b),</font>,</p> 
<p><font color= "blue">"to destroy the devil's work" (1 John 3:8b),</font>,</p>
<p><font color= "blue">"to bring fire upon the earth," (Luke 12:49),</font>,</p>
<p><font color= "blue">"to testify to the truth" (John 18:37).</font>,</p>
<p> 
But each of these seems like a means or aspect of the ultimate purpose, to save us from our sins. Consider these purpose statement verses:</p>

"Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" (John 1:29)</font>,</p>

"For the Son of Man came to seek and to save what was lost." (Luke 19:10)</font>,</p>

"For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many." (Mark 10:45)</font>,</p>

"Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners." (1 Tim 1:15)</font>,</p>

"But you know that he appeared so that he might take away our sins." (1 John 3:5)</font>,</p>
<h3>
The Cup and the Baptism
</h3>
<p>
Jesus had a very clear view of what lay ahead of him. He used two metaphors: "To drink the cup," to partake fully of an event, and "to be baptised," to be immersed fully in the event.

"Can you drink the cup I drink or be baptised with the baptism I am baptised with?" (Mark 10:38)</font>,</p>

"But I have a baptism to undergo, and how distressed I am until it is completed! (Luke 12:50</font>,</p>)

"Father, if you are willing, take this cup from me; yet not my will, but yours be done." (Luke 22:42)</font>,</p>

"Jesus commanded Peter, 'Put your sword away! Shall I not drink the cup the Father has given me?'" (John 18:11)</font>,</p>

The cross in all its horror --  and in its redemptive power to bear the sins of the world --  hung heavily on Jesus during his last days in the flesh. His struggle in the Garden of Gethsemane was the climax, the point at which he surrendered ultimately to the Father's will. And now the cup had been drunk, the baptism completed. It is finished.</p>
<h3>
It Is Finished!
</h3>
<p>
Look again at the passage. It is remarkable in how it repeats one singular idea --  completion, fulfilment, finishing.

"Later, knowing that all was now completed, and so that the Scripture would be fulfilled, Jesus said, "I am thirsty" ... When he had received the drink, Jesus said, "It is finished." With that, He bowed His head and gave up his spirit." (John 19:28, 30)</font>,</p>
<h3>
A Cry of Victory
</h3>
<p>
It is clear from Matthew and Mark that just before Jesus breathed His last, He "cried out again in a loud voice" (Matt 27:50, cf. Mark 15:37)</font>,</p>. John gives us the content of this loud cry: "It is finished!"

Those who are defeated go out with a whimper, but the victor announces his victory loudly and broadly: "It is finished!" The victory shout of Jesus echoed across the small flat hilltop and to the world beyond. It is finished!
<h3>
The Announcement of Obedience Fulfilled
</h3>
<p>
It is a cry of accomplishment, but it is also an announcement of obedience fulfilled. This shout began in the painful will of the Father --  the cup, the baptism, the suffering, the cross. "It is finished" announces the full obedience of the One who, though equal with God:

"... but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bond servant, and coming in the likeness of men. And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross. Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father." (Phil 2:7-11)</font>,</p>

Make no mistake. The ability to say, "It is finished" to the Father's commission was not the beginning of some kind of "glory road," but the end. It was the final culmination of a life of obedience, humility, and suffering that now ushers in a new era.
<h3>
What Should We Learn from "It Is Finished"?
</h3>
<p>
When we meditate on this Sixth Word from the cross, what should we learn for our lives? This is what I see.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
We Are to Live Lives of Purpose</font>
<p>
First, we are to live lives of purpose. Unless Jesus had a purpose, a mission to complete, the words, "It is finished" would have had little meaning. He wasn't speaking of His earthly life that was finished --  in fact, His life has no beginning and has no end. Rather, He is speaking of that which the Father had instructed Him to do.

Our lives may not be so clear, so purpose-driven as Jesus' life. However, I believe that one of the signs of maturity in our lives is to discern our spiritual gifts and abilities, and then order our lives so as to maximize what God has given.

Jesus told the Parables of the Talents (Matt 25:14-30) and the Pounds (Luke 19:11-27). In each case, success for the servant was to "trade with" what the master had given him in order to produce the largest possible outcome for the master, given each servant's unique talents, time, and circumstances. The reward was to hear the master say, "Well done, good and faithful servant ... enter into the joy of your lord" (Matt 25:21).
<p><font size="+1">
We Are to Live Lives of Focus</font>
<p>
Second, living lives of purpose requires us to focus on our priorities. Instead of living scatter-shot lives, we are to be marksmen that aim carefully at the target and make our shots count. This requires focus and discipline. It means saying "No" to some choices so that we can say "Yes" to opportunities that are even better.
<p><font size="+1">
We Are to Live Lives of Obedience</font>
<p>
Third, to be able to say, "It is finished," as Jesus did, our lives must be marked by obedience. Jesus is God, but in his earthly life he willingly obeyed. <font color= "blue">"He humbled himself and became obedient to death" (Phil 2:8)</font>.

Paul put it this way:

"I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me." (Gal 2:20)

Obedience is the opposite of independent action. It means living in obedience to God, not to ourselves.
<p><font size="+1">
We Must Be Willing to Suffer to Achieve God's Purpose</font>
<p>
Finally, to say "It is finished," we must be willing to suffer to achieve God's purpose for our lives. We continue in the sunny summer days as well as the stormy winters of our lives. We don't give up just because things are difficult. We are willing to suffer whatever is necessary to complete the Father's plan for our lives.</p>
<p>
When our lives are over, we want to be able to say with St. Paul,
<font color= "blue">
"The time of my departure is at hand. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. Finally, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will give me on that Day, and not only to me but also to all who have longed for His appearing." (2 Tim 4:6-8)</font></p>

And with Jesus to say: "It is finished!"
