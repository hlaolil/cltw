   <h1>
Adultery
</h1>
<p>
It is of great Importance to bear in mind, Jesus insisting, that we understand that He did not come to destroy the law and the prophets but to fulfil them. Not one iota or tittle of the law shall fail; heaven and earth will pass away but the Word of God stands.</p>
<p>
This, however, does not mean that we are under law, that we are to be saved by works of law that we perform; truth is, that by works of law no flesh is ever justified before God. That is the very heart and keynote of the Gospel tidings. But even so we are to perform good works since when Christ redeems us by His blood, He also renews us by His Spirit according to His image; good works are the fruit of salvation in Christ in our lives. They are the infallible fruits of election. It belongs to the ways of the elect to walk in all good works. For grace does not abolish the law but it establishes it.</p>
<p>
This fundamental truth of the Gospel should be kept very clearly before our minds lest we fall into the error of legalism on the one hand, and antinomianism (against the law) on the other hand.</p>
<p>
That is also true in regard to the proper understanding of the Seventh Commandment.<br>

It is to this commandment that Jesus calls the attention of His hearers on one of the slopes of a mountain in Galilee:<br> <font color= "blue">“You have heard that it was said to those of old, "You shall not commit adultery."  But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell. (Matt 5:27-30)</font></p>
<p>
In this passage there are various elements that should be set forth in bold relief. They are the following:</p>
<p>
Firstly, we should notice that Jesus lets the text of Ex 20:14 stand just as it was spoken, by the Lord from Mount Sinai and written upon the Tablets of Stone. <br>It is true, against this the Scribes and Pharisees have no complaint. <br>They too insist very much on the accuracy of the text.<br> Both say: You shall not commit adultery!</p>
<p>
Secondly, we should notice, that there is a very different interpretation given of this commandment by the Jews and by their tradition than what is given by Jesus here in Matt 5:27-30. The Jews simply made this commandment refer to the physical act of fornication; they did not make it apply to the sinful desires from which the act springs. They did not understand that the outgoings of man are from the heart; that we are as are our hearts. Make the heart good and the fruit is good, and make the heart evil and there will be evil fruit. <br>By the fruits we know what the heart is like even as by the water what is the nature of the fountain from which it springs, and from the quality and amount of the harvest what is the nature of the soil. That is simply a law of nature. <br>Jesus points out these truths to us bringing forth old and new treasures out of the law and the prophets.</p>
<h3>
Jesus' interpretation
</h3>
<p>
And what is this different interpretation?
It is the truth that adultery must be sought not simply in the act of a man committing fornication in the very deed with “your neighbours wife”, but that it must be seen already in the first sinful desire; therefore Jesus says: But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart!
<h3>
The Heart 
</h3>
<p>
The thoughts that are ours do not simply spring forth from the mind.<br> It is never the teaching of Scripture that thoughts are simply those of a logical content; thoughts are always ethically qualified. Thoughts that are in our hearts must be revealed in their ethical nature. Jesus was set as a sign in Israel, we read, in order that the thoughts of many hearts be revealed. <br>Thus the aged Simeon speaks prophesying concerning Jesus in the temple.<br> And it is well to bear this in mind.</p>
<p>
Behind these thoughts of the heart are the desires, the affections.<br> In a good and righteous man these desires are the natural and pure longings and affections of the soul. As soon as a man is sinful, and we all are by nature, then these desires are wrong, sinful and they are lusts. Lusts are simply evil desires, desires contrary to the law of God. It is of these desires that Jesus is here speaking. These evil desires are lusts. And in connection with the Seventh Commandment these lusts are carnal, they are the evil lustings of the flesh and of the eyes. These lusts are behind the deed of fornication.</p>
<p>
Certainly this command forbids this fornication on the part of a man.<br> No man may cast lustful glances at a woman. Certainly this does not merely mean that only a married man may not look at his neighbour's wife in lust, but it also means that an unmarried bachelor may not look thus at an unmarried maiden. The “whoever looks” makes this prohibition universal.<br> This is also indicated by the fact that the text speaks of “a woman”. <br>It does not make a bit of difference whether she is married to another or not. Anyone casting lustful glances at a woman commits adultery with her in his heart. Such is the clear teaching of Jesus</p>
<p>
The question may be raised whether Jesus means to exclude the woman from this prohibition. We are of the conviction that such is not the case.<br> Neither may a woman cast lustful glances toward a man, nor, and that is still more denatured, lustful glances toward another woman. We must dare to confess with the Heidelberg Catechism that this Seventh Commandment teaches that “all uncleanness is accursed of God”. As to the question why Jesus directs this prohibition to man we may answer, that this is the usual manner of speaking in Holy Writ. The law is directed to man. He is the head of the wife and is the one who is addressed representatively. Thus it is here in this case.<br>

When the commandment is thus viewed it is also evident that no one can keep his eyes from vanity in his own strength so that they will “look right on”.<br> Well may we say with Job “I have made a covenant with mine eyes”. <br>And we are also reminded of what John says of the lust of the flesh and of the eyes, and that Peter describes evil men as having “eyes full of adultery”.
<h3>
The Eye and the Hand
</h3>
<p>
Jesus rather presupposes that we have spiritual eye trouble. That our eyes cause us to stumble is implied in the conditional clauses here employed in the text. The “If your right eye causes you to sin ...” presupposes that such is indeed the case with us. The same is also presupposed in the next clause where we read “if your right hand causes you to sin ...” The eye and the hand are here viewed as being very really offending members. It is at once humbling and encouraging to notice that presupposition in the text. It teaches us that we need to come a long way to arrive at perfection, but that yet the situation is not hopeless for us in Him, Who has come to fulfil the law and the prophets.
<h3>
Is it hopeless
</h3>
<p>
No it is not, because the offending eye can be plucked out, and the offending hand can be cut off.<br>

What does this mean to pluck out the right eyes and to cut off the right hand?<br>

Must, this be taken in the literal sense of the term? We think not. <br>In the first place because such is never the instruction of Holy Writ elsewhere when speaking of the flesh that must be crucified in the power of the Holy Spirit. (Rom. 8:13). Nowhere does the Bible teach that literal amputation of members of the body is a cure for the sin of evil desires. The eunuch as well as the blind and the maimed still have to fight against these lusts or perish in them.<br> Besides Jesus did not mean to say that the eye sins or the hand.<br> It is we who sin by our hand and by our eyes. And the lust is back of the eye. The eye simply is the medium of lust and the hand the medium of the act. <br>And so we do not believe that Scripture would understand this in the literal sense of the term; Jesus does not advocate literal amputation of limbs and sense organs.</p>
<h3>
What to do then
</h3>
<p>
We believe that the eye stands for the organ whereby the lust conceives and the hand stands for the act of lust in its execution. The Word of God spoken here is exactly as it is told us concerning the fall of Adam and Eve in Paradise.<br> We read that the stages through which the fall went were the following:</p>
<p>1. The desire for Satan’s word,</p>
<p>2. Looking at the tree that it was good for the eyes,</p> 
<p>3. Taking of the fruit and giving it to Adam.</p>
<p> 
Thus it is also here in the language of Jesus. The lust of the heart, the conception with the eye and the act of adultery.<br> James said<font color= "blue"> “But each one is tempted when he is drawn away by his own desires and enticed. Then, when desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death.” (James 1:14-15)</font>.</p>
<p>
No, we must not think, that Jesus advocates literal amputation.<br> The right eye is wholly clean and the right hand only performs righteousness when the heart is righteous. So we must purify our hearts, circumcise our hearts and not our foreskins. We must turn to the Lord in sincerity and truth. <br>Then  only can we really stop the eye and the hand from causing us to stumble and sin.</p>
<p>
May we pray with the Psalmist:<br> 
<font color= "blue">Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in Your sight, O Lord, my strength and my Redeemer.!” (Psa 19:14)</font></p>
