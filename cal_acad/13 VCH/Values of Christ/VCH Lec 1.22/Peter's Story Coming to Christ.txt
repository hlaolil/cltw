Peter's Story Coming to Christ
</h1>
<p>
Peter, the fisherman-disciple, embarked on a lifetime journey with Jesus Christ. We can do the same</p>
<h3>
Walking on the Water
</h3>
<p>
Their small fishing boat was being battered about in the stormy Sea of Galilee. Suddenly, out of the darkness emerged a shadowy figure. Incredibly, the phantom seemed to be — yes, it was — walking on the water toward them.<br>
For a moment, the disciples were more frightened by this ghostly apparition than by the turbulent sea and their tossing boat (Matt 14:22-33). But then the figure called out to them: “Take courage! It is I. Don’t be afraid.”<br>
Still not convinced, Simon Peter shouted out, “Lord, if it’s you, tell me to come to you on the water.” Jesus invited Peter to come to him. Peter climbed out of the boat and — miraculously — began to walk on the water toward Jesus.

But Peter, feeling the wind beating against his body and the waves swirling about him, became afraid and started to sink into the cold, dark water. “Lord, save me!” Peter cried out, and Jesus reached out and caught his hand. Next thing he knew, they were both in the boat, and the wind had died down.

The disciples were stunned by the event, and by this man, Jesus. The Gospel of Matthew says, <font color= "blue">“Those who were in the boat worshipped him, saying, "Truly you are the Son of God” (Matt 14:33)</font>.

Peter and the other disciples had come face to face with Jesus as the One who saves. For a fleeting moment, they recognised something special about Him — something they couldn’t explain.</p>
<h3>
Who am I?
</h3>
<p>
Not long afterwards, Jesus and His disciples came to Caesarea Philippi, where most of the residents were pagans. The city was north of the Sea of Galilee, at the base of Mt. Hermon. The city was filled with reminders of a pagan religious world. In such an unlikely place, Jesus Christ popped the question about His own identity (Matt 16:13-20).

He asked His disciples, saying, <font color= "blue">“Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?” So they said, “Some say John the Baptist, some Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.” (Matt 16:13-14)</font>.
<h3> 
More than a man
</h3>
<p>
But something was missing in the people’s identification of Jesus. If He was merely the greatest of the great, He was still only another man. Jesus was looking for another answer. He asked His disciples, <font color= "blue">“But who do you say that I am?” Simon Peter answered and said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.” (Matt 16:15-16)</font></p>
<p>
Jesus’ question to His disciples is the same question He poses to each of us: “You, what do you think of me?”</p>
<p>
As Jesus told Peter, this is not knowledge we discover on our own. <font color= "blue">“Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in heaven.” (Matt 16:17)</font>

God had revealed to Peter who Jesus was — and God must do the same for us. We must have an internal experience of Jesus Christ, one that God makes possible by opening our understanding through the Holy Spirit. The biblical scholar and author William Barclay wrote, “Christianity never consists in knowing about Jesus; it always consists in knowing Jesus”.

To know Jesus Christ is to experience Him, to believe in Him and to follow Him. By God’s grace, Christians are led to belief—belief that changes our lives.
<h3>
Called to a New Life
</h3>
<p>
In the New Testament, the idea of repentance includes the idea of changing one’s mind, one’s way of thinking. Repentance will often result in a change of behaviour, but it begins in the mind, in the heart.

After Jesus’ death and resurrection, the disciples, including Peter, were given the Holy Spirit. By an act of God’s grace, they received the gift of repentance and were converted (John 20:22; Acts 2:1-4). On that memorable Day of Pentecost, about seven weeks after Jesus’ death, Peter gave his first public sermon. He urged devout Jews to repent, become converted and receive the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38).

But Peter spoke about repentance and conversion — a turning to God — in a surprising way. First, he did not tell his audience that they had to change their lives in terms of obeying the law of Moses more diligently and accurately.

The people listening to Peter were Jews who already worshipped God and obeyed the law (verse 5). Most of these devout Jews did not need to repent of what we commonly think of as corrupt, immoral behaviour. They were what we might call good, church-going, religious folks. They weren’t flagrantly and habitually defiling the Sabbath, burning incense to idols or killing people.

In the context of repentance and conversion as “turning one’s life around,” what could these Jews have done differently? Externally, not much. But Peter’s directing them to repentance was an imperative, a command. It was a change of mind regarding Jesus, not a change in behaviour. He asked them to enter into a new relationship with Jesus as their resurrected Saviour. The context of Peter’s first public sermon makes his purpose clear. He began by pointing his hearers to Jesus Christ, whom he said they had rejected and their leaders had killed (verses 22-23). This was the basis of their guilt and sin.

Throughout the sermon, Peter hammered away at one point: Jesus Christ is Lord and Saviour, and people must put their faith in Him. This turning to Jesus in faith was summarised as a simple charge to his hearers: “Repent and be baptised” (verse 38).

What they were to repent of was their rejection of Jesus as Messiah and Saviour. Peter’s sermon explained repentance as a change of mind about Jesus — as an experience of Him — as an acceptance of Him as Saviour. Peter called on his listeners to believe in Jesus Christ and to place total faith in Him as their Saviour.
