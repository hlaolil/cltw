<h1>
Those Who Mourn
</h1>
<p>
Christ’s statement in Matthew:5:4 seems contradictory. How can those who mourn be happy? But God’s way of life does produce joy (Psa 16:11; Gal 5:22).<br> Mourning can be a blessing because:<br>
It causes us to think more soberly about life (Eccl 7:2-4).<br>
It keeps us from becoming complacent (Deut 8:11-18).<br>
It helps us to have compassion for others, as Christ did (Heb 5:7-9).</p>
 <p>
There are three situations where we should mourn:<br>
When we see the suffering of others (Ezek 9:4).<br>
When God’s Spirit convicts us of sin (James 4:8-10).<br>
When we suffer persecution.</p>
 <p>
Christ finished His statement by promising comfort to those who mourn (Matt 5:4). God provides this comfort in many ways:<br>
Through the Bible (Rom 15:4).<br>
By David’s example (Psa 34:4-7).<br>
Through prayer (Phil 4:6-7).<br>
By reassuring us we are not alone in our trials.<br>
By His promise not to tempt us beyond what we are able (1 Cor 10:13).<br>
By reassuring us that He is on our side (Rom 8:31-39).<br>
Through the hope of the resurrection (1 Thess 4:13-14).<br>
Through one another.<br>
By reassuring us that He is able to save us (Jude 24-25).</p>
 <p>
Ultimately there will be no more mourning. "And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes" (Rev 21:4).</p>
