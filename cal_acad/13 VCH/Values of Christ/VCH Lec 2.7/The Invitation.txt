<h1>
The Invitation
</h1>
<p>
At first glance, this last section of the Sermon on the Mount seems like 
miscellaneous teachings disconnected from Matt 5—6. A closer reading, however, illustrates that these teachings recapture and reinforce previous instructions. For example, as disciples earlier learned about 
the right way to view others (Matt 5:3–48), now they are warned 
about improper judging of others (Matt 7:1–5). Just as prayer and care 
were previous emphases (Matt 6:7–15,25–32), they are once again the focus of 
Matt 7:7–11. The beginning blessings of the Sermon (5:3–12) are framed by a 
series of warnings at the end (Matt 7:13–27).

Connections with Jesus’ previous teachings are also found in His use 
of the rabbinic technique, noted in the last lesson, of lesser to greater 
(Matt 7:11). Jesus also continues to draw on the storyteller’s toolbox of vivid 
imagery, such as specks and logs, bread and snakes, figs and thistles, and 
houses on rocks or sand. With Jesus’ use of such picture language, Jesus’ 
audience carried vivid lesson reminders with them long after the words 
of the sermon had faded from their hearing.This last section of the sermon also reveals the continuing emphasis on transforming actions of discipleship   Not surprisingly, these last words of the sermon go to the heart of Jesus’ message — choosing to practice transforming acts of discipleship. The teaching of Jesus energises a disciple for living in the kingdom of God.
<h3>
Judging and Being Judged (Matt 7:1–5)
</h3>
<p>
Matt 7:1–2. Jesus presents a clear and concise imperative, “do not judge.” Yet 
this prohibition cannot rule out all judging. Even within the next few 
verses, Jesus encouraged disciples to judge false prophets by their actions (Matt 7:15–16). Most likely Jesus means do not attempt to be God in making 
judgements. God is the only one who can and will sort out the inward 
motives of a person. This sorting judgement related to the end time is readily illustrated in the parable of the net and the fish (Matt 13:47–50). Humans are not to usurp the role and prerogatives of God. Jesus prohibits this type of judgement.</p>
<p>
In the reciprocity of giving and getting judgement, one hears echoes 
of forgiveness.  Instead of attempting divine judgement, Jesus has already taught about the mutuality of forgiveness (Matt 6:14–15). By substituting the 
word forgiveness for judgement, one better grasps Jesus’ hope for disciples:</p>
<p> <font color= "blue">“For with what judgement you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you.” (Matt 7:2)</font> </p>
<p>
Forgiveness, not judgement, is the imperative of discipleship.</p>
<p>
Matt 7:3–4. Like a political cartoonist who tells truth by exaggeration, Jesus 
creates a humorous scene in which a person with a large wooden beam (big sin) in his or her eye is walking around making critical pronouncements on the tiny speck (little sin) in other people’s eyes. Such a scene is laughable, except the underlying point is so accurate. Biases, social location  and a myriad of other factors cloud a person’s judgement. Without self awareness, judgement becomes arrogant and self-serving.</p>
<p>
Matt 7:5. Jesus, however, does suggest one can help remove specks (sins) from 
another’s life. The potential speck remover, however, must first help himself
or herself, that is, get rid of the big sins in his or her life. When a 
person has integrity and demonstrates discipleship values, others will be willing to allow that person the delicate operation of getting the specks 
out of their eyes.</p>
<h3>
A Riddle (Matt 7:6)
</h3>
<p>
This verse is most puzzling because Jesus speaks in riddle-like language. 
He uses two positive images, “holy” and “pearls,” and two negative animal 
images, “dogs” and “swine.” The oppressive context in which Jesus lived 
encouraged speaking in riddles. Jesus’ message about the empire of God 
clashed with the empire of Rome. Listening peasants could knowingly 
nod in understanding the attacking and mauling “dogs” and “swine” as 
Rome and its values. Jesus was urging His disciples not to compromise with the empire; instead He encouraged them to hold fast to the values(“holy,” “pearls”) of God’s empire.</p>
<h3>
Asking and Receiving (Matt 7:7–11)
</h3>
<p>
Matt 7:7–8. In these verses, Jesus returned to the theme of prayer. He prescribed  specific actions—asking, searching, and knocking—which all received positive responses from God. Jesus focused on God’s readiness to respond in grace to humanity. This prayer initiative is not a mechanical  process by which one submits to God any request and automatically receives. One “asks,” “searches,” and “knocks” in the spirit of Jesus and the spirit of justice. Is the object of petition worthy of God’s will?</p>
<p>
Matt 7:9–11. Jesus’ assurance of God’s goodness is given amplification in a 
simple rhetorical question. If a hungry child asks for bread or a fish, does 
one respond with a rock or snake? The answer in Jesus’ day, as in ours, 
is a resounding of course not! “Gifts” of rocks and snakes are given by 
deviant and perverted persons. With a lesser to greater argument, Jesus 
illustrates that God will be as graceful to us with the good things of life 
as we are in providing for a child’s needful request.</p>
<h3>
Living in Relationships (Matt 7:12)
</h3>
<p>
Although many people may struggle to locate this verse in the New 
Testament, this teaching is one of the best known in all the Bible and is 
crowned with the label “Golden Rule.” This particular verse summarises 
all that has gone before by bringing to conclusion the Sermon on the 
Mount. Jesus began by emphasising He had not “come to abolish the law 
or the prophets” (Matt 5:17), and now He encapsulates the essence of the law 
and prophets in this summation.</p>
<p>
This “Golden Rule” implies that disciples have spirits that empathise 
with the feelings and thoughts of other people. One enters into another 
person’s experience; or in contemporary jargon, one understands where 
that person is coming from. Jesus highlighted this type of empathy in 
the Beatitudes. Empathy, however, is only the first step; the directive 
to disciples is to act on the feeling. This action of doing is practising 
the characteristics of godly grace as reflected in Jesus’ own life. Just as 
God knows how to give “good things” to humanity (Matt 7:9–11), disciples also should practice this same type of loving kindness with others. The 
others are not limited to those within the community of faith but include 
all people.</p>
<h3>
Paths Taken and Left (Matt 7:13–14)
</h3>
<p>
From this point, the sermon focuses on warnings about the importance of making the right choices. The “wide” gate and wide road (a better translation than “easy” road) is a metaphor for a popular way that seems on the surface best. Jesus might have in mind the Roman roads and by implications following the way of the empire. In contrast to the  well constructed and easily passable roads of Rome, the narrow and rocky goat path may seem unattractive. This road, however, is straight (a better translation than “hard”) and focuses a person toward a goal of justice that ends in joy and life. Jesus again lays before His disciples the choice: the world (Rome and empire) or God’s kingdom.</p>
<h3>
False Prophets (Matt 7:15–23)
</h3>
<p>
Matt 7:15–16a. To reinforce His point, Jesus names some folks who have chosen the wide gate and wide road. He calls them false prophets,  individuals who disguise their intentions as good (“sheep’s clothing”) but whose inward motivations are evil (“ravenous wolves”). As found throughout the Sermon, inner motivations continue to be a key for authentic discipleship practice.
Even though these prophets disguise their motives, one can still assess their true character. Interior motives eventually bloom and produce the fruit of outward actions. Jesus teaches that one should check the fruit of one’s actions very closely. In other words, examine the lifestyle of 
the prophet as one criterion for evaluating his or her intentions. Greed, 
ego, and arrogance reveal false prophets for who they truly are.</p>
<p>
Matt 7:16b–20. Jesus connects good and bad actions with an analogy to good 
and bad fruit. In Matthew’s perspective, actions bear on one’s present 
relationship with God and one’s final destination. The Book of Revelation 
highlights this same perspective, <font color= "blue">“And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books.” (Rev 20:12)</font>. One is not predestined to be either a good or bad tree. The Sermon teaches that each person has a choice of the words and deeds (fruits) one will do.</p>
<p>
Matt 7:21–23. Some false prophets are well disguised and difficult to recognise in their sheep’s clothing. Even their fruit may seem to be good 
works, such as prophecy, casting out demons, and doing “deeds of 
power.” Because our vision and ability to judge are always impaired by 
our humanness (Matt 7:1), ultimately God is the one who renders the 
final judgement and says, “I will declare.” Because we can be fooled and 
God cannot, only God removes the corrupt and false.</p>
<h3>
Hearing and Doing (Matt 7:24–27)
</h3>
<p>
Jesus contrasts two types of individuals often found in the Old Testament, 
the wise and foolish (Prov 10:1;14:1;15:20). Wisdom is grounded on the 
rock of Jesus’ teaching, but it also includes acting on the teaching. James, 
perhaps reflecting on the words of Jesus, wrote,<font color= "blue">“But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.” (James 1:22). </font>
In contrast to the wise, the foolish person hears Jesus’ words but chooses 
not to act. The issue is not deafness to Jesus’ words about justice and the 
will of God but acting on them.</p>
<h3>
Focusing on the Meaning
</h3>
<p>
Jesus in these verses and in all of the Sermon on the Mount laid out a 
simple, narrow, and direct path to the will of God. The map of discipleship is not obscure or difficult to navigate but clear and realistic. The 
issue is with the one travelling the discipleship path. One writer has captured succinctly this problem, “The second most unused book I suppose, 
is the Holy Bible, a perennial best seller thanks to our good intentions 
to attend to the Word and divine the Lord’s Will, which one does for a few days until you realise that you already know the Lord’s Will and 
you would prefer not to.” We know the will of God as revealed in Jesus’ teachings. Do we have the will to do it?</p>
<p>
Part of the good news is that not only does Jesus present us with the 
path of right choices, but he also models for us the way of transforming love. As one continues to read through Matthew’s Gospel, it shows that 
Jesus did not live in the ivory tower of theological abstractions but in the 
earthly world of practising justice and mercy. Beyond the clear path the 
sermon presents and the model of Jesus, we also can make right choices 
because the Spirit of God energises us to do God’s will.</p>
<p>
Paul the Apostle understood this energising Spirit well in his own 
ministry. He shared this insight with the Philippians when he wrote, <font color= "blue">
“for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure.” (Phil 2:13)</font>. 
In our own power and human effort, we fail, but with the Spirit of God and the encouragement of a community of faith, we have the resources to make discerning decisions that reflect kingdom values and that can bring transformation into our world. </p>
