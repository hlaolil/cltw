<h1>
Love your enemies
</h1>
<p>
When Jesus said we are to love our enemies, He was creating a new standard for relationships. He proclaimed to the crowds listening to His Sermon on the Mount that they knew they were to love their neighbour because the command to love our neighbour was a law of God (Lev 19:18). That we must therefore hate our enemy was an inference incorrectly drawn from it by the Jews. While no Bible verse explicitly says “hate your enemy,” the Pharisees may have somewhat misapplied some of the Old Testament passages about hatred for God’s enemies (Psa 139:19-22; 140:9-11). </p>

Jesus replaced this idea with an even higher standard: <font color= "blue">“love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you, that you may be sons of your Father in heaven;” (Matt 5:44-45)</font>. Jesus goes on to explain that loving those who love us is easy and even unbelievers can do that. Then He commands us to <font color= "blue">“be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect” (Matt 5:48)</font>.</p>
<p>
Jesus explained to His followers that they should adhere to the real meaning of God’s law by loving their enemies as well as their neighbours. A Pharisee once asked Jesus,<font color= "blue"> “Who is my neighbour?” (Luke 10:29)</font>. Jesus then told the Parable of the Good Samaritan. Here Jesus taught that His followers must demonstrate love to all kinds of people—no matter what faith, nationality, or personality—enemies included. If you love your enemies and “bless those who curse you,” then you truly reveal that Jesus is Lord of your life.</p>

By using an illustration of the sun rising and the rain falling on both the good and the evil, Jesus shows God’s undiscriminating love to all people. His disciples then must reflect His character and exhibit this same undiscriminating love for both friends and enemies. Jesus is teaching us that we must live by a higher standard than what the world expects—a standard that is impossible for us to attain by our own efforts. It’s only through the power of God’s Spirit that His people can truly love and pray for those who intend to do them harm (Rom 12:14-21).</p>
<p>
Finally, after giving us the admonition to love our enemies, Jesus then gives us this command: <font color= "blue">“be perfect, just as your Father in heaven is perfect” (Matt 5:48)</font>. As sons of our Father (Matt 5:45), we are to be perfect, even as He is perfect. This is utterly impossible for sinful man to achieve. This unattainable standard is exactly what the Law itself demanded (James 2:10). So how can Jesus demand the impossible? He later tells us,<font color= "blue"> “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.” (Matt 19:26)</font>. That which God demands, only He can accomplish, including the demand to love our enemies. What is impossible for man becomes possible for those who give their lives to Jesus Christ through the power of the Holy Spirit who lives in our hearts.</p>
