Salt of the Earth
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
"You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt loses its flavour ..." (Matt 5:13)</font></p>
<p>
You and I, as Christians, are called the salt of the earth because our lives enhance and give meaning to this existence we call life. Before salvation, we were like grains of sand, too numerous to count. But after receiving Christ, we were transformed - no longer like minuscule debris of rock having little or no difference from another lost piece of sand, to something distinctive in taste, texture, and aroma.</p>
<p>
It may be an odd analogy, but Jesus compared believers to salt for a reason. Salt is a dietary mineral, used for flavouring and preservation - needed by all known living creatures. If abused, it can be harmful. However, it is also detrimental to have no salt intake because it regulates the water content in our bodies. Jesus used salt to describe how Christians are needed to bring balance and hope to an otherwise dying world.</p>
<p>
The question He asked however is, "What good is salt if it has lost its flavour?" In other words, if a Christian has lost his or her gusto and fervour, then what's the difference between the old grain of sand they once were and the so-called salt they are now? The answer is: very little.</p>
<p>
Trials can cause us to become weary if we're not careful. And just like salt can become diluted in water, Christians can become diluted (or altered) by their experiences. For example, what we believed before a traumatic event is sometimes not the same as afterwards. Why is that? There could be many reasons, but the most common is depression, fatigue, self-doubt, and ultimately reservations about what we believed in to begin with. And we have to clearly understand there is an enemy at work in these cases. If we are the salt of the earth and it's possible to lose our flavouring, then it's no secret the Devil will do his best to make sure our effectiveness (our flavouring) isn't what it used to be. And if he had his way in every case, we'd have no flavouring left at all - returning to transparent grains of sand with no threat to him or his kingdom.</p>
<p>
Jesus said, <font color= "blue">"Salt is good, but if the salt loses its flavour, how will you season it? Have salt in yourselves, and have peace with one another." (Mark 9:50)</font></p>
<p>
Consider this: the sea is full of salt but it is only extracted through the process of boiling (removing the water to retain the salt). I don't like the idea of going through fiery trials, but if that's what it takes to recapture the "salt" in my life, than maybe I'm okay with that. What I've learned is that God is not the destroyer in this life. He said <font color= "blue">The thief does not come except to steal, and to kill, and to destroy. (John 10:10). </font> <br> God is not the thief.God is the "Restorer" of broken lives and broken hearts.</p>
<p>
The boiling process will either prove or disprove the amount of salt contained in a substance. In the same way, the trials of life will either prove our lives are flavoured by God or they will reveal how much we truly lack.<br> Either way, if handled correctly, the end result can be beneficial.<br> For the one, their revelation of Jesus Christ and His grace and faithfulness will increase; for the other, a realisation of their small faith can push them to a deeper relationship with God because despite their lack, He remains faithful.<br> The only problem is: God has left the "salt containers" (you and I) to decide.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened to you; 13 but rejoice to the extent that you partake of Christ’s sufferings, that when His glory is revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy." (1 Peter 4:12-13)</font><br>

I have learned I can’t always control the trials I face, but I am the keeper of my "salt." <br>Will I be bitter or better? Less seasoned or more flavourful? Will I disappear into the background or stand out as an overcomer? Because in the end, what good am I if I've lost my flavouring?</p>
