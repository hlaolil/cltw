   <h1>
Some of Christ's Values for us
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
"For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and loses his own soul?" (Mark 8:36)</font>.</p>
<h3>
When Winning Matters Too Much
</h3>
<p>
Jesus Christ never taught His followers to be ruthless or relentless.<br> He emphasised instead the importance of sharing, helping, serving, being your brother’s keeper and loving your neighbour as yourself.<br>

So then, is success in the competitive world off limits for a Christian?<br> Would it be wiser to play it safe and withdraw from the race, preferring a poverty-level life on the sidelines while we wait for a better world? <br>No, that is not what Jesus Christ said to do. He made it clear that His followers, as individuals and as a body, were to be productive and useful members of society. <font color= "blue">"Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven" was His instruction (Matt 5:16).</font></p>
<h3>
Win, Lose or Withdraw?
</h3>
<p>
The gospel has the power to change people’s lives, and people who believe the gospel should show that change. A follower of Christ should be a positive influence, setting an example, as Jesus Himself did. A Christian should not "drop out."</p>
<p>
The Bible strongly emphasises the importance of supporting yourself and your family. In the early years of the church, when some people stopped participating in their society because they thought Jesus would soon return, the apostle Paul reminded them:<font color= "blue"> "If anyone will not work, neither shall he eat" (2 Thess 3:10)</font>. Of course, this principle does not apply to those who find themselves unavoidably unemployed. It applies only to those who are not willing to work and support themselves. Any one of us can temporarily lose a job, and need support and encouragement.</p>
<p>
The Bible endorses education, diligence and the value of making sound investments. The Bible does not prevent those who work hard from enjoying the fruits of their labour. Jesus counted several wealthy people among his friends and supporters. Zacchaeus was rich (Luke 19:2), as was Joseph of Arimathea (Matt 27:57).</p>
<p>
Do we stand a better chance of pleasing God if we become rich, ambitious and upwardly mobile? Are poor Christians in humble circumstances letting God down? Not at all. The apostle Paul reassured even slaves—surely the least upwardly mobile of all occupations—that they could live in a way that had God’s approval.</p>
<p>
Jesus called people from many backgrounds—household servants, merchants, fishermen, tax collectors, scholars, common soldiers and senior military officers. He would have accepted a rich young ruler if the man had not been so tied to his material possessions (Matt 19:16-22).</p>
<p>
It is no different today. People from every race, ethnic group and economic background make up God’s church. All can be equally successful in God’s sight. It isn’t who you are or what you have that determines how successful you are in God’s sight. It is what you let God do with what He has given you that decides whether or not you are a success.</p>
<h3>
Talents and pounds
</h3>
<p>
We can understand this if we look at two of Jesus’ parables, which at first seem to tell the same story. But there are subtle differences, and each adds to our understanding of what Jesus Christ expects of us.

Let’s look first at the parable of the pounds, found in Luke 19:11-27. Jesus told this parable while travelling to Jerusalem in the days just before the final events of His ministry. He realised His disciples would not understand what was about to happen. They were looking to Jesus to restore their nation’s fortunes by overthrowing the Roman government and establishing the prophesied messianic age.</p>
<p>
But Jesus knew that many centuries would pass before He would set up His kingdom on earth. Instead of leading a popular revolt, Jesus was about to be arrested, tried and crucified. The parable of the pounds was given to help His disciples, and all of us, understand how we should live as we look forward to Christ’s return.</p>
<p>
In the parable, Jesus likened Himself to a nobleman who went on a journey, leaving his affairs in the hands of his servants. Each servant received 10 pounds (orminas), about three months wages, with instructions to put the money to work through business, investment or trading (Luke 19:13,15). Notice that these servants were not asked to trade with resources they had earned or deserved. They were entrusted with their master’s resources. All they had for trading was what he had given them.</p>
<p>
When the nobleman returned, he called the servants to account.<br> One servant had done exceptionally well, increasing his mina tenfold. <font color= "blue">And he said to him "Well done, good servant, because you were faithful in a very little, have authority over ten cities" (Luke 19:17)</font>. The reward was generous, but the master knew what he was doing. The servant was honest and diligent. He had shown by the way he handled a relatively small amount that he could be trusted with much, much more.</p>
<p>
The second servant had also done well. He had increased his master’s investment fivefold. It was a solid, responsible effort.<font color= "blue"> "You also be over five cities," said the nobleman (Luke 19:19).</font></p>
<p>
However, a third servant came forward and gave the original sum back, saying: <font color= "blue">"Master, here is your mina, which I have kept put away in a handkerchief" <br>(Luke 19:20)</font>. This servant had done nothing. He hadn’t traded or invested they money. Realising his master would not be pleased, he blamed his master.<br> <font color= "blue">"I feared you, because you are an austere man. You collect what you did not deposit, and reap what you did not sow" (Luke 19:21).</font></p>
<p>
The nobleman’s reaction is surprising. He did not say, "So you decided to play it safe. Well, at least you didn’t lose it." Instead, he is angry and disappointed, since he had expected at least some return on his investment (Luke 19:22). <font color= "blue">"Why then did you not put my money in the bank, that at my coming I might have collected it with interest?" he demanded (Luke 19:23)</font>.<br> This servant’s responsibility was taken from him, and given to the one who had the tenfold increase.</p>
<p>
What is the point Jesus was making in this story? It is that God expects us to produce something with what He has given us. Remember, the emphasis is on the gift He has given us. When God calls us, He entrusts us with knowledge of great value. Paul, speaking of those God calls, said: <font color= "blue">"To them God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles: which is Christ in you, the hope of glory" (Col 1:27).</font></p>
<p>
"Christ in you, the hope of glory" includes the understanding of repentance and forgiveness of sin, the good news of the gospel of the kingdom, and the gifts of salvation and the Holy Spirit. The Bible speaks of <font color= "blue">"true riches" (Luke 16:11)</font> and the <font color= "blue">"pearl of great price" (Matt 13:46)</font>. It is a gift that Jesus’ disciples are not to keep to themselves, like secret treasure (or buried talents). They should take this good news to the world (Matt 28:19-20).</p>
<h3>
A Cheerful Getter?
</h3>
<p>
The Bible does not condemn worldly success. But neither does it guarantee it. Unfortunately, many people who claim to be Christians regard material prosperity as a sign—no, make that the sign—that their lives are pleasing to God. Material prosperity is an unreliable indicator of righteousness (Heb 11:3738). We must not forget the Bible’s warning about the <font color= "blue">"deceitfulness of riches" (Mark 4:19)</font>.</p>
<p>
How do you do business with these gifts? Are they "negotiable"? In a sense, yes. These gifts give us power—to change, to live in hope even when things go wrong, to be a positive influence, to serve and to do good. The results of the Holy Spirit—love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness and temperance—have a great potential for good when put to use</p>
<p>
Jesus expects His gifts to change our lives, and these changes should be evident for all to see.<font color= "blue"> "A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden, nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lamp stand, and it gives light to all who are in the house" (Matt 5:14-15)</font>.</p>
<p>
But the parable in Luke 19 can be misused to give an apparent green light to those who are naturally success oriented. They might think that the parable means "Go for the good life. Get as much as you can. You’ll reap the reward now and for all eternity. Better use those power techniques." No, that isn’t the intent of the parable. We can further understand why when we look at a similar, but not quite the same, parable in Matt 25.</p>
<h3>
The true riches
</h3>
<p>
In this parable, the traveller entrusts a much larger sum to his servants.<br> <font color= "blue">"To one he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one" (Matt 25:15)</font>. The talents are not used here in our modern sense of implying a skill or ability. In Jesus’ day, a talent was a unit of exchange of considerable value.</p>
<p>
The master in the parable gave each of his servants a different number of talents. He knew they were different in background, education and natural ability. He knew that such differences would not limit the percentage of increase that his servants could attain.</p>
<p>
The man with five talents traded wisely and made a 100 percent return on the investment (Matt 25:16). So did the servant with only two talents (Matt 25:17). He produced two more talents—also a 100 percent return. He used his opportunity just as effectively as his colleague.</p>
<p>
The servant with only one talent could have followed the example of the others. If he had produced only one more talent, he still would have had a 100 percent increase. But he didn’t. He played it safe, or so he thought, by burying his talent in the ground (Matt 25:18). He thought only of himself. He did not reach out. He did not take advantage of opportunities. He served no one and reaped no benefit from his master’s investment.</p>
<p>
When the master returned, he praised the servant who had made five talents: <font color= "blue">"Well done, good and faithful servant; you were faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things. Enter into the joy of your lord" (Matt 25:21)</font>. He said almost the same words to the servant whose increase was two talents. The master rewarded the degree of effort, not the amount of increase.</p>
<p>
But, as in the other parable, the servant who returned only the original investment received condemnation. <font color= "blue">"You wicked and lazy servant ... You ought to have deposited my money with the bankers, and at my coming I would have received back my own with interest" (Matt 25:26-27)</font>. </p>
<p>
Even those who feel they do not have much to offer can support others in their efforts. Not everyone is able to be the leader, but everyone can do something to help. Almost anything is better than following the example of the servant who buried the talent and then sat idly waiting for the master’s return. That was not what he had been given the talent for!</p>
<p>
Jesus expects each of us, whoever we are, whatever our station in life, no matter what age, to use what He has given us. He is not impressed with great ability, nor daunted by lack of it. He expects us to make the most of our circumstances to serve, help and be a light to this world. Acts of kindness, unselfishness, generosity, thoughtfulness and compassion do not go unnoticed. <font color= "blue">"inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of these My brethren, you did it to Me." (Matt 25:40)</font>.</p>
<p>
There is no reason why Christians shouldn’t become prosperous and influential, provided that fame and fortune remain in the right perspective in our lives.<br>Paul reminds those who become rich, <font color= "blue">"not to be haughty, nor to trust in uncertain riches but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy. Let them do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to give, willing to share" (1 Tim 6:17-18)</font>.</p>
<p>
Jesus turned the conventional perks and privileges of success upside down. <br>He said to His disciples, <font color= "blue">"He who is greatest among you, let him be as the younger, and he who governs as he who serves" (Luke 22:26)</font>. <br>The way to eternal life is ultimately open to everyone because Jesus Christ, unquestionably the greatest among us, was willing to use his resources—his power, his glory, even his life—so we could share what he has for eternity.
<font color= "blue"><br>
"For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich" (2 Cor 8:9)</font>.<br> We, too, can let Christ work in us to enrich others. We should strive to make the most of the precious gifts he has entrusted to our care. That is a sure formula for success. It is not a guarantee of abundant fame and fortune, though that may come too. But you can be certain of a far more satisfying success—the kind that comes from living a life pleasing to God. <br>Make that success your goal and one day you, too, will hear your Master say, "Well done, good and faithful servant."
