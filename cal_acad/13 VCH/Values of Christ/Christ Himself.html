   <h1>
Christ Himself
</h1>
<p>
If you or I were telling the story of Jesus today, we would inevitably bring out things about Jesus that are particularly important to us, or that we see as particularly important for people today to hear. The evangelists were the same, as the so-called redaction critics have told us. Matthew, Mark, Luke and John have all told the story of Jesus in different ways, because all had their own agenda in writing their accounts.</p>
<p>
John quite specifically tells what his agenda is in John 20,<br> <font color= "blue">
"These are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name." (John 20:31)</font></p>
<p>
This may well have been the original ending of the gospel, with John 21 being a sort of appendix. Whether or not it is, it sums up the gospel brilliantly. <br>Chapter after chapter in the gospel, story after story, may be seen as trying to help us believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God and that there is life in Him.</p>
<p>
So the first observation to make about John is that the gospel's focus is on the identity of Jesus. Of course, Matthew, Mark and Luke are interested in the person of Jesus too. But, whereas they give us a relatively broad-brush picture of Jesus' teaching about the kingdom of God and of His work, John's gospel has a narrower Christological focus, probably (as we shall see) because he was in a situation where people were proposing all sorts of answers to the question:<br> Who is Jesus?</p>
<h3>
Jesus as Jewish Messiah
</h3>
<p>
So who is Jesus according to John? He is, first, 'the Christ', being the Greek translation of the Hebrew 'Messiah' (i.e. anointed one). By this John means that Jesus is the king from the family of David, whose coming to save God's people was predicted in various Old Testament passages (e.g. Isa 9:1-7, 11:1-3).</p>
<p>
There is the interest of people in Jesus as Messiah, which is greater than in any of the synoptics. In the synoptics the emphasis on Jesus as Messiah is definitely muted, though Peter's confession of Jesus at Caesarea Philippi marks a turning-point in Jesus' ministry (Mark 8:29). In John, however, people are openly talking about Jesus as Messiah from John 1 onwards (John 1:41,49), and there is keen public debate about whether Jesus is the Messiah or not (John 7:25-31, 41-44).</p>
<h3>
Jesus as Divine Son
</h3>
<p>
But, if John wants us to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, he goes much further seeking to demonstrate that Jesus is also "the Son of God". <br>The other gospels teach this as well: thus in Mark Jesus calls God<font color= "blue">
 "Abba, Father" </font>
and speaks of Himself in the parable of the vineyard as the beloved son of the vineyard owner (Mark 14:35, 12:6, cf. 13:32); in Matthew and Luke Jesus comments: <font color= "blue">
"Nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal Him" (Matt 11:27/Luke 10:22)</font>.<br> But John emphasises Jesus as 'the Son' much more than the other gospel writers, and makes it clear that Jesus is 'Son of God' in a very strong sense.<br>In the Old Testament the king may be spoken of as son of God (2 Sam 7), and in the New Testament so may every Christian (Gal 4:4-7, admittedly only through a relationship with Jesus). But John uniquely has Jesus speak of Himself as <font color= "blue">
He who came down from heaven, who was with the Father in the beginning before the world began (3:13, 17:24)</font>. 
Jesus in John can say <font color= "blue">
"Before Abraham was, I AM ...",</font> and be rewarded by His opponents seeking to kill Him for blasphemy (John 8:58,59)</font>. To use a technical term, Jesus in John's gospel is 'pre-existent', in a way that is not explicit in the synoptic gospels.</p>
<p>
In trying to define how exactly John understood Jesus' divinity we should not assume that he had the sort of Trinitarian understanding that Christians subsequently worked out. One important category that he does use to identify Jesus is the category of 'the word' (Greek logos). This comes out in the majestic, almost poetic prologue to the gospel in John 1:1-18.</p> 
<p>
Scholars have debated the significance and origin of John's term: it has been seen as a thoroughly Greek term, since Stoic philosophers, among others, spoke of a logical principle of order – logos can mean 'word' or 'reason' – at the heart of the universe. But it is also a thoroughly Jewish concept, since the Old Testament speaks of God creating the world by 'His word' and of His word powerfully accomplishing His will (Isa 55:11, Psa 33:6). If we have to choose between a Greek and a Jewish background for John's concept of 'the word', it is almost certainly the Jewish background that should win: the opening words of the prologue 'in the beginning' and the subsequent reference to 'light in darkness' remind us inevitably of Genesis 1, where God's creative word is so powerful. Furthermore, the whole idea of God creating through the agency of His word is reminiscent of various Jewish texts which speak of divine wisdom as God's creative agent (e.g. Prov 8, Wisdom).</p>
<p>
For John Jesus comes out from God, and communicates with us. In other words: Jesus reveals God. <font color= "blue">
"No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him" (John 1:18) </font><br>
The Greek word translated "He has declared Him" could be translated "He has explained Him", and what John is saying is that if we want to know what God is like, look at and listen to Jesus. The Jews had a ban on making any image of God; they believed that any image would be a distortion. But Jesus, according to John, is a true revelation of God, and He can say <font color= "blue">
"He who has seen Me has seen the Father" (John 14:9)</font>. He is the visible word of God, come in flesh. </p>
<p>
One of the questions that has most engaged readers of John, from the early church fathers up to the most modern scholars, is: how does John understand the relationship of 'the Father' and 'the Son': is the Son God in the sort of way the creeds would later speak of Him? Or is He simply a human agent through whom the divine life shines, one with the Father in purpose and love, but not in His being and nature? Jewish thought could speak in very strong terms about the authority of someone's agent and representative, and in John's gospel Jesus is 'sent' by the Father, and is dependent on and obedient to Him <br>(e.g. John 5:19, 36f., 7:29, 57). He can also speak of the Father as 'greater than I' (John 14:28).<br> And yet Jesus in John seems much more than God's agent: when He says in John 8 <font color= "blue">"Before Abraham was, I AM" (John 8:58)</font>, He both asserts His pre-existence, but also in using the expression 'I am' speaks of Himself in a way that recalls the Old Testament's way of speaking about God.<br> The implication, which His opponents recognise (as they seek to stone him), is that Jesus is claiming something that would be blasphemous for any human being (John 8:59). Human beings, who receive Jesus, are 'children of God'<br> (John 1:12), but Jesus is uniquely the Son, not by rebirth but from the beginning; thus He can work on the Sabbath, as God does, but as no human being should (John 5:17).<br> Thus Thomas at the end of John 20 can worship the risen Jesus as <font color= "blue">"My Lord and my God", (John 20:28)</font> which is an appropriate climax to John's gospel, but would be quite inappropriate for one who was not really divine. 
<h3>
Reasons for believing: signs and witnesses
</h3>
<p>
But why ever should anyone believe that Jesus the Galilean was divine?<br>The answer for John comes in his important John 20: <font color= "blue">"Jesus did many other signs in the presence of His disciples ... these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ the Son of God." (John 20:30-31) </font><br>It is the miracles of Jesus for John that are signs – signposts, we might say – of His divinity. He has miracle stories:</p>

<p>the turning of the water to wine (John 2),</p>
<p>the healing of the nobleman's son (John 4),</p>
<p>the healing of the lame man at the pool of Bethesda (John 5),</p>
<p>the feeding of the 5000 and the walking on the water (John 6),
<p>the restoration of sight to the man born blind (John 9), 
<p>the raising of Lazarus (John 11); 
<p>finally there is Jesus' own resurrection.</p>
<p>
The synoptic gospels also contain plenty of miracle stories, of course.<br>But, as so often, John has a rather different angle on things: not only does he have a rather distinctive collection of rather distinctive miracles (with the feeding of the 5000 and the walking on the water being the only ones in common with the synoptics), but he also presents the miracles with a particular slant. </p>
<p>
In the synoptics the miracles are evidence of and indeed part of the coming of the kingdom of God: the Old Testament promised a new day of God's salvation, and Jesus brings it by opening the eyes of the blind and healing the lame.<br> John also understands the miracles in that way: thus Jesus' turning the water of Jewish purification into wedding-wine is highly suggestive of Jesus bringing God's new day, and the other miracles too give insight into the salvation that Jesus is bringing. But what is special about John's perspective is that he sees the miracles primarily as revealing who Jesus is and as evidence for believing in Jesus. </p>
<p>
So, after describing the water turned to wine, John comments:<br> 
Jesus <font color= "blue">
manifested His glory; and His disciples believed in Him. (John 2:11)</font>.<br>The glory in question is the glory of the only Son of God, which has been referred to in John 1:14. The miracles are signs of God's glory, indeed are works of God, which should lead to a response of faith (John 10:25).</p>
<p>
The distinctive thing about John's view of the miracles is that they are explicitly (not implicitly as in the synoptics) 'Christological', pointing to who Jesus is. <br>And it is not just the miracles: John speaks of various people and things 'witnessing' to Jesus – the miracles are such witnesses, but so are John the Baptist, Moses, the Scriptures, as well as God himself (e.g. John 5).<br>Like the miracles, the other witnesses 'testify about me' (John 5:39,46).<br> Jesus' followers are also to be His witnesses through the Holy Spirit<br>(John 15:26-27), and John sees his own gospel in that category: it is witness which is true and is designed to lead to belief – belief in Jesus as Son of God (e.g. John 19:35). People may refuse to believe, but that is because of culpable blindness, not because of deficient evidence (John 5:40,47, 9:41, 12:37,40). </p>
<h3>
Is Jesus human in John?
</h3>
<p>
John's portrayal of Jesus as divine is so strong, that some scholars have doubted whether John's Jesus is really human. They have spoken of John as tending to 'Docetism' – Docetism being the second century heresy which asserted that Jesus only appeared to be human. It is easy to see why John's Jesus could be viewed this way: He is, as we have seen, a divine figure who 'comes down' from heaven; He makes divine claims and has divine powers, turning water into wine, knowing the life-story of a stranger when He meets her at the well in Samaria, raising the dead.</p>
<p>
Most striking of all is John's account of the death of Jesus, when this is compared with the account of the synoptics. <br>In Mark's gospel Jesus suffers intensely: in the garden of Gethsemane before His arrest He is in agony and begs God that He should not have to face death; the disciples fail Him and run away; and eventually He is crucified and utters a cry of despair, as it seems: <font color= "blue">"My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" <br>(John 14:34-52, 15:34)</font>. <br>In John on the other hand Jesus seems in total control in Gethsemane: when soldiers came to arrest Him, He asked <font color= "blue">“Whom are you seeking?” And they said, “Jesus of Nazareth.” Jesus answered, “I have told you that I am He. Therefore, if you seek Me, let these go their way (John 18:1-8)</font>. <br>
At his trial Jesus is seen to be the king with even more authority than the Roman governor, Pilate, and, when He dies, His cry is not one of despair, but of victory or completion –<font color= "blue"> "It is finished!" (John 19:30)</font>.</p> 
<p>
So is it right to conclude that John's Jesus is not human? Against this is the key statement in John 1, where John specifically says that <font color= "blue">"the word became flesh" (John 1:14)</font>. The word 'flesh', which is used also in John 6:51-59 where Jesus speaks of eating His flesh and drinking His blood, sounds distinctly undocetic. <br>The Greek suggests a real flesh and blood person, and the Jesus of John, though so divine, has what seem to be normal human attributes: </p>
<p>
getting tired (John 4:6),</p>
<p>
feeling sadness and shedding tears (John 11:35),</p>
<p>
being thirsty (John 19:28, cf. 4:7).</p> 
<p>
It is quite true that John emphasises that Jesus is really victorious not vanquished at the cross, but it is clearly a real crucifixion that is described, as the readers would have realised. And, although there is less sense of struggle in John than in the synoptics, still Jesus is troubled at the prospect of His death (John 12:27); and His laying down of His life is a hugely costly sacrifice on His part, as is made clear when Jesus speaks of the good shepherd laying down His life for the sheep and of a man laying down His life for His friends (John 10).</p>
<p>
It is doubtful if an ancient reader, familiar with the gory business of crucifixion, would see in John's story what the modern critic comparing the text of John and Mark sees. The ancient reader might indeed be impressed with Jesus' calm control, but the proper conclusion would not be that Jesus did not suffer, but that Jesus' glory is seen in how he conquers in and through so dire a situation</p>
<p>
It is arguable, in fact, that John is doing almost exactly the opposite to what has been suggested by scholars: i.e. that he is glorifying the cross not to diminish or eliminate the idea of Jesus' suffering, but rather to counter some of his contemporaries who had little or no place for the cross in their theology. <br>John on this view wants to affirm its climactic importance in the mind of Jesus and the purpose of God.</p>
<h3>
The death of Jesus: atonement in John?
</h3>
<p>
Before leaving John's picture of Jesus' death, it is worth noting that scholars have not only claimed that John portrays a suffering-free crucifixion, but also that John does not see Jesus' death as an atoning sacrifice for sin, as do Mark and Matthew (e.g. Mark 10:45).<br> In John it is simply a victory. To this we may respond that John does indeed stress that the cross is a victory: it is a victory over Satan, who is called <br><font color= "blue">"the ruler of this world" (John 14:30)</font>. The picture is of Satan having hijacked God's world, and of Jesus in the cross confronting Satan and Satan confronting Jesus. The confrontation is a dark moment, but the outcome is 'the judgement of this world' (i.e. of Satan's kingdom) and the 'casting out of Satan' (12:32). The gospel which fails to describe any of Jesus' individual exorcisms still has the idea of Jesus casting out the evil cosmic ruler through His death.</p>
<p>
This is indeed a notable emphasis in John. But how does Jesus cast out Satan through the cross? John may not answer that directly, but he gives a host of clues. For example, he sees Jesus as the new Passover lamb: that is probably the sense of John the Baptist's words about Jesus in John 1, <font color= "blue">"Behold the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world"; (John 1:29,36)</font> it is almost certainly in mind when John makes the point that Jesus' bones were not broken in the crucifixion, citing the Old Testament law about not breaking the bones of the passover lamb (19:36, cf. Ex 12:46). John brings out very clearly that Jesus died at passover time, and some see this as the explanation of one of the great puzzles to do with John and the synoptics.</p>
<p>
The puzzle is that the synoptics suggest that Jesus' last supper with His disciples was a passover meal, whereas John suggests that Jesus died before the passover meal (John 18:28, 19:31). Scholars have proposed that John altered the synoptic chronology in order to make Jesus' death coincide chronologically with the killing of the passover lambs, which obviously preceded the passover meal. If they are right, then this would underline the importance of the passover for John, and also reinforce the view that John was less interested in historical accuracy than in theological exposition. However, they are probably not right: there are various other possible explanations of the divergence of John and the synoptics, all of which suggest in one way or another that there were different 'passover' meals around the time of the crucifixion:</p>
<p>
To revert to the question of the atonement in John: John may not spell out his atonement theology, but he uses all sorts of images, which show that he sees Jesus' death as a saving sacrifice. Thus Jesus through His death is the passover lamb, who brings liberation. He is like the bronze snake lifted up by Moses to save the sinful Israelites from divine plague and judgement (Num 21:9).<br> He is the good shepherd who gives his life for the sheep (John 10).</p>
<p>
He is also the one who <font color= "blue">"gives His flesh for the life of the world" (John 6:51).</font> John 6 is one of the most fascinating passages in John. It starts with Jesus feeding the 5000, and then this miracle is followed up, in typically Johannine style, with a discussion of Jesus as the bread who has come down from heaven, the bread that surpasses the old manna in its importance and saving effects. <font color= "blue">
And Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. He who comes to Me shall never hunger, and he who believes in Me shall never thirst. (John 6:35).</font></p>
<p>
The clear message, which is constantly affirmed in John, is that Jesus is the one who gives life, and that the way to receive it is to believe in him. <br>The discussion, however, takes a new turn in John 6:51, where Jesus speaks of giving His flesh for the life of the world, and then of the necessity of eating His flesh and drinking His blood. What seems to happen at this point in the chapter is that Jesus, having spoken up to this point in general terms of Himself as the living bread, now specifically refers to His death on the cross as what brings life. He has spoken earlier about believing in Him and coming to Him, and this in context is how we must understand 'eating' the flesh and 'drinking' the blood: Jesus is saying that faith in His saving death is necessary for eternal life.</p>
<h3>
Jesus' death, the last supper and the Eucharist
</h3>
<p>
One of the interesting questions raised by the verses that speak of the flesh and blood of Jesus is how they relate, if at all, to the last supper, as described by the synoptics, where Jesus invites His disciples to eat 'My body' and to drink 'My blood', placing a particularly strong emphasis on the necessity of participating in the sacramental elements. But John is not someone who emphasises the sacraments rather than faith; rather he sees faith being expressed in the Lord's supper.</p>
<p>
Whatever is concluded about the eucharistic significance (or insignificance) of John 6:51-59, the verses make it clear that Jesus' death, probably understood sacrificially (hence 'flesh' and 'blood'), brings salvation. Something similar may be said about John's own account of the last supper in John 13, where the washing of the disciples' feet is at one level simply an astonishing example of humility, if not humiliation, on Jesus' part, but which is on another level an acted parable, through which Jesus graphically explains his coming death. <br>It is this that makes sense of Jesus' words to Peter: <font color= "blue"><br>
"Unless I wash you, you have no part in me" (John 13:8</font><br>
The thought is that Jesus must wash Peter's sins away through the most humiliating service of all, i.e. the cross, if Peter is to share in the life Jesus has come to bring. </p>
<p>
Jesus' death is also seen to be of supreme saving importance in a striking passage in John 11, where the Jewish authorities are worried about Jesus' popularity: <font color= "blue">
 If we let Him alone like this, everyone will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and nation.” (John 11:48)</font><br>
 The high priest Caiaphas then said to his colleagues: <font color= "blue">
“You know nothing at all, nor do you consider that it is expedient for us that one man should die for the people, and not that the whole nation should perish.” (John 11:49-50)</font><br>
John makes a comment that reflects, interestingly, a Jewish view of the high priest's spiritual powers: <font color= "blue">
 "Now this he did not say on his own authority; but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation, and not for that nation only, but also that He would gather together in one the children of God who were scattered abroad. (John 11:50-52).</font><br>
 Caiaphas, of course, intends to say that eliminating Jesus will remove a potential flash-point with the Roman authorities, but John sees him as inadvertently describing the saving effects of Jesus' death.<br> From our point of view what is interesting is the light that this throws on John's view of Jesus' death: Jesus dies so that people may not perish but have eternal life as the saved and gathered people of God (cf. 12:32).</p>
<p>
It turns out that, although John does have such a strong stress on Jesus' death as victory, he sees this victory as achieved through the sacrificial and cleansing death of Jesus. Just as the synoptics see the death of Jesus as a new passover bringing liberation and the kingdom of God, as is clear from the last supper narratives and the important 'ransom' saying of Mark 10:45, so John sees the Lord's death as bringing the end of exile and dispersion for God's people, in other words as bringing eternal life.</p>
<h3>
Eternal life and eschatology
</h3>
<p>
But mentioning eternal life brings us on to consider one of the most obvious distinctives of John's gospel. <br>John says that he has written his gospel <font color= "blue">
"that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name". <br>(John 20:31)</font><br>
Whereas the synoptic Jesus announces and brings the kingdom of God, in John Jesus has come to bring eternal life. It is one of the odd things about John that he only uses the phrase 'kingdom of God' twice (in John 3:3,5), whereas he continually talks about life and eternal life. It is as though the tables are turned completely: with kingdom of God being the dominant theme in the synoptics and 'eternal life' being very much subsidiary (e.g. Mark 10:30), but with the opposite being the case in John.</p>
<p>
At first sight this looks like one of the clearest evidences that John is less historical than the synoptics, John having substituted an idea – eternal life – that would be accessible to Greek readers for the distinctly Jewish idea of the reign of God. However, the difference turns out to be less significant than it might seem, when we explore the meaning of eternal life in John.</p>
<p>
For John eternal life is the opposite of 'perishing' or being destroyed, as is clear from the famous John 3:16. John believed in divine judgement – it is an important theme in his gospel – and for him the importance of believing in Jesus is because everyone will appear before the judgement seat of God, with believers being saved and others dying 'in their sins' (John 8:24). <br>John compares the Israelites in the Sinai desert who experienced divine judgement in the form of fatal snake-bites, but who were saved by looking at the bronze snake put on a pole by Moses: so the lifted up Jesus on the cross is the way to life out of death.</p>
<p>
But, if eternal life is, negatively, the opposite of death, what is it positively? <br>John might well choose to answer that by referring us to his description of what Jesus does for people, since he is very clear that Jesus brings life to people. <br>The famous 'I am' sayings of John's gospel make that point:</p> 
<p>"I am the way and the truth and the life",</p>
<p>"I am the bread of life", </p>
<p>"I am the resurrection and the life". </p>
<p>
Those sayings in themselves may suggest something of how John sees the life that Jesus brings, but so may the stories of Jesus' work: for example, the story of the water turned to wine in John 2 may be seen as a picture of the eternal life that Jesus brings; so in John 10:10 Jesus can speak of 'life in all its fullness'. Eternal life is like bread satisfying hungry people; so Jesus can say 'he who comes to Me will never go hungry, and he who believes in Me will never be thirsty' (John 6:35). It is like Lazarus being dramatically raised from the dead, i.e. something that overcomes the sadness and finality of death.</p>
<p>
But John does not simply give us vivid pictures of what eternal life is. <br>In John 17 he gives us a definition: <font color= "blue">
"This is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent. (John 17:3)</font><br>
'Knowing' here is not to be understood as academic or theoretical knowledge, but in personal terms, as when we say: 'I know so and so'. In English we can distinguish 'being acquainted with someone' and really 'knowing them', and the sort of knowledge that John has in mind is something much more than acquaintance. </p>
<p>
In the Old Testament Adam is said to 'know' Eve his wife, the reference being to sexual intercourse (Gen 4:1);</p>
<p>
And the same use of the word 'know' is found in Matthew's gospel of Joseph and Mary (Matt 1:25).</p>
<p>
In John 17:3 there is no sexual connotation, but the knowledge of God referred to is a strong, even intimate relationship with God. </p>
<p>
In John 14 Jesus says: <font color= "blue"> “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word; and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our home with him." (John 14:23)</font></p> 
<p>
This is what eternal life is for John: having a loving relationship of fellowship with the Father and with Jesus.</p>
<p>
The word translated 'home' in John 14:23 is literally 'abiding or dwelling place', and is related to the the famous passage about the vine in John 15, where Jesus encourages His disciples to: <font color= "blue">"abide in me". (John 15:4)</font> Eternal life in John is to be in close relationship with God. We could say that it is to be brought into the love and life of the divine family: Jesus is seen as 'abiding' in the Father in love and unity, and Jesus has come to bring other people into this wonderful family relationship. This fits in with what Jesus says in His famous prayer in John 17, where He prays for His followers to be one <font color= "blue">"as You, Father, are in Me, and I in You; ...", (John 17:21)</font> and it fits in too with the strong emphasis in John's gospel on the importance of His followers 'loving one another', since eternal life is all to do with sharing in the divine life and the divine love.</p>
<p>
It turns out that eternal life in John is not the Greek idea of the survival of the individual soul beyond death, but is a strongly Jewish idea: the pictures of the vine and the shepherd are Old Testament ideas associated with Israel (e.g. Psa 80:14-16, Isa 5:1-7, Ezek 34). The idea of God gathering His divided and scattered people into one is a prominent theme in the Old Testament prophets.<br>
So too the concept of God's restored people 'knowing God' is found in the Old Testament in that most famous passage in Jer 31, where God promises a new covenant written on people's hearts: <font color= "blue">No more shall every man teach his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, "Know the Lord," for they all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them (Jer 31:31-34).</font> </p>
<p>
John believes that Jesus has come to bring this new covenant, this new day. So Jesus can say to the Samaritan woman at the well: <font color= "blue">"Jesus said to her, “Woman, believe Me, the hour is coming when you will neither on this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, worship the Father. You worship what you do not know; we know what we worship, for salvation is of the Jews. But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father is seeking such to worship Him". (John 4:21-23).</font><br> Jesus is not here making a generalised statement about inward religion being superior to worship in particular places, but he is announcing the coming of the day promised by Jeremiah and other prophets, when God would do a new work in people's hearts.</p>
<p>
The same is probably the background to John 3, where Jesus tells the Jewish leader Nicodemus that he needs to be 'born again of water and the Spirit'. The most likely background to this is in an Old Testament passage like Ezek 36, where God promises: <font color= "blue">"I will take you from among the nations, gather you out of all countries, and bring you into your own land. Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean; I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols. I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; I will take the heart of stone out of your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will keep My judgements and do them. Then you shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; you shall be My people, and I will be your God". (Ezek 36:24-28).</font> Jesus, in speaking to Nicodemus, is in effect saying that this day spoken of by the prophets has now come, and that Nicodemus needs to get in on it: he needs to be part of the gathered people of God (= eternal life), and for this to happen he needs to be cleansed and given a new heart, i.e. to be born again, by the Spirit of God.</p>
<h3>
A note on Water and Baptism
</h3>
<p>
Scholars have discussed the meaning of <font color= "blue">"being born of water ..." (John 3:5)</font>. <br>It very probably does pick up on a passage like Ezekiel 36; but does it also refer to baptism? Is baptism the way for Nicodemus and others to be <font color= "blue">"sprinkled with clean water ... and cleansed from impurities?</font> However, there is a very good case for seeing the water as baptism: John 3 comes in the middle of a section of John's gospel where there has been a lot of discussion of John's baptism and of Jesus' baptising people (from John 1:33 - John 4). Most strikingly in John 4:1-2 Jesus and His disciples are said to 'make disciples' by baptising people.</p>
<p>
To say that John may see the 'water' in John 3:5 as baptism is not to suggest that John is watering down(!) his emphasis on faith: on the contrary, for John baptism is the way for someone like Nicodemus to express one's faith in Jesus. Baptism in the modern church has often got separated from conversion, by baptists as well as by infant baptists; and adults when they want to come to Jesus are told to 'pray a prayer in their hearts' and perhaps also to come forward to the front of a meeting to meet up with counsellors. <br>But in the early church it seems that the person wanting to put their faith in Jesus was told there and then to come for baptism (Acts 2:38). So baptism was not an empty or magical ritual, but a powerfully meaningful act of faith, full of joy and a sense of the Holy Spirit's presence (as often happens in modern conversion). John's readers, many of whom are likely to have experienced adult conversion and baptism, will surely have understood Jesus' words to Nicodemus as baptismal. </p>
<h3>
Eternal life and the kingdom of God
</h3>
<p>
Whether or not Nicodemus' water is baptismal, the Old Testament background to John 3:5 in passages like Ezekiel 36 is hard to miss. And what follows from this, once again, is that the background to John's teaching about eternal life (and in this case to being 'born again') is much more Hebraic and Old Testament than is often recognised, and that it is much closer to the synoptic teaching about the kingdom of God than one might suppose. In the synoptics the kingdom of God that Jesus announces is the coming of the rule and salvation of God promised in the Old Testament prophets, including, of course, the coming of Jeremiah's new covenant. Eternal life in John is similarly life of the new age.</p>
<p>
Indeed the word 'eternal' may have that very connotation. In English 'eternal' suggests everlastingness. However, it is quite likely that the Aramaic phrase used by Jesus was, literally translated, 'life of the age', meaning 'life of the coming age'. This, as we have seen, is precisely how John understands the phrase. Not that John would exclude the idea of eternal life being everlasting; on the contrary, the story of Lazarus and Jesus' saying 'I am the resurrection' make it clear that this is an important dimension of eternal life, but for John eternal life is much more than deathlessness: it is something much richer, focussing on a relationship of love and unity with God, with Jesus and with other believers. <br>This is life in its fullness, and in synoptic terms it is life in the kingdom of God.</p>
<h3>
The Holy Spirit
</h3>
<p>
We have already hinted at the importance of the Holy Spirit for John, and it is necessary to look more closely at this now, since one of the distinctive things about John is that he has so much more teaching about the Spirit than the synoptics.</p>
<p>
We have seen that for John Jesus is the one who has brought the day promised in Old Testament passages, like Jer 31 and Ezek 36, that speak of God doing a new work in people's hearts. Ezekiel 36 speaks of the Spirit of God in that respect. In the Old Testament the Spirit is typically seen as the 'wind' or 'breath' of God, that comes mightily on many of the leaders of God's people, judges (like Samson), kings (like Saul and David), prophets (like Elisha and Ezekiel). </p>
<p>
If that is the Old Testament experience of the Spirit, the Old Testament prophetic hope is, on the one hand, for renewed Spirit-inspired leadership: thus the famous Isaiah 61 speaks of one 'anointed' by the Spirit and bringing good news to the poor. But, on the other hand, the Old Testament looks forward to a universal experience of the Spirit, with all God's people, not just the leaders, being given 'a new heart' (so Ezek 36); most famously Joel speaks of God's Spirit being poured on all flesh and even the men servants and the maid servants prophesying (Joel 2:28-32).</p>
<p>
John sees Jesus as the new Spirit-endowed leader (John 1:32).<br> He also sees Jesus as bringing the universal experience of the Spirit to all believers; indeed the giving of the Spirit seems an almost interchangeable idea with that of eternal life. And this is understandable given John's view of eternal life as fellowship with the Father and the Son, since it is precisely through the Holy Spirit that the Father and the Son come to dwell with the believer. <br>This is clear from John 14, where Jesus at one moment promises that to those who love Him and keep His commandments He and the Father will come, and <font color= "blue">"We will come to him and make Our home with him." (John 14:23)</font>, and at another moment he says <font color= "blue">“If you love Me, keep My commandments. And I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may abide with you forever— the Spirit of truth," (John 14:15-17)</font>.</p>
<p>
One may suppose that John thought of the disciples in Jesus' lifetime as experiencing eternal life just by being with Jesus (since eternal life is fellowship with the Father and the Son), but the fuller experience is dependent on Jesus' death. It is Jesus' death that brings cleansing and eternal life, and it is Jesus' death that brings the experience of the Holy Spirit (John 7:38,39). <br>Paradoxically it is Jesus' going away that enables Jesus to come back through the Holy Spirit, and this is eternal life. </p>
<p>
For John the Holy Spirit is very much associated with Jesus: He is the agent of Jesus, as Jesus is the agent of the Father; He witnesses to Jesus and reveals Him; like Jesus He is a 'paraclete' or counsellor to the disciples (see John 14-16 especially). The Greek word parakletos could be translated 'encourager', but may well have legal connotations and suggest a legal 'advocate' who stands with his client when under trial.</p>
<p>
At first sight this all sounds rather different from the synoptic gospels, where the Holy Spirit has a very much less prominent role than in John, and where He is not called 'paraclete' or 'Spirit of truth', as He is in John. However, the difference is not as deep as it might at first appear: the synoptics agree that Jesus is the Spirit-filled anointed-one, who fulfils passages such as Isa 61 and who works by the Holy Spirit, for example in casting out demons <br>(e.g. Matt 12:28, Mark 3:29, Luke 4:18).<br> The synoptics also agree that Jesus is the One <font color= "blue">"He will baptise you with the Holy Spirit.” (Mark 1:8),</font> bringing in the new covenant through His death <br>(Mark 14:24).<br> Just as in John the eternal life brought by Jesus has to do with the Spirit, so in the synoptics the kingdom of God comes through the working of the Spirit <br>(e.g. Matt 12:28). The synoptics do not use the word 'paraclete', but do speak of the Holy Spirit aiding the followers of Jesus in times of trial and giving them the words to speak (e.g. Matt 10:20, Mark 13:11).</p>
<p>
John's view of the Spirit turns out not to be so different from that of the synoptics, though John has much more teaching about the Spirit, bringing out particularly the Spirit's role in continuing the work of Jesus after His departure.</p>
<h3>
Future hope?
</h3>
<p>
Another matter in which John is often thought to be very different from the synoptics is in his eschatology, or, as some scholars might say, lack of it! Whereas the synoptics have Jesus and His disciples praying 'Your kingdom come', and looking forward eagerly to the triumphant coming of the Son of man on the clouds, for John there is little emphasis on a future judgement day: eternal life has come already for those who have faith (John 3:18, 5:24).<br>Scholars speak of John's 'realised eschatology'. It has been argued that John lived at a time when the church was having to adjust to Jesus' failure to return (to the so-called failure of the parousia), and that he chose to emphasise Jesus' spiritual presence in the church through the Holy Spirit rather than His future return: Jesus did promise to 'come again', but did so in the person of the Spirit.</p>
<p>
This view could help to explain John's emphasis on the Spirit. But it is certainly an oversimplification to say that John has replaced the future hope of the synoptics with an emphasis on the present. In the first place, we must not underestimate the emphasis on the present in the synoptics: there is a very strong stress in all three of them on the exciting presence of the new age in Jesus (e.g. Matt 13:16, 17, Luke 4:21). But in the second place, there is future hope in John. In John 21 there is a discussion of whether the beloved disciple would live till the future coming of Jesus; and earlier in the body of the gospel Jesus speaks of coming back to take His disciples <font color= "blue">"that where I am, there you may be also". (John 14:1-3).</font><br> He also refers to the judgement of the Son of man, <font color= "blue">"when all who are in the graves will hear His voice and come forth —those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation". (John 5:28-29).</font></p>
<p>
John can speak of eternal life now, which is entirely understandable given his definition of eternal life as fellowship with the Father and the Son.<br> But especially in John 14-17, where Jesus looks forward to the time after His departure and speaks at length of the sufferings that His disciples will have to endure, it is very clear that the church's experience of the Holy Spirit is not full eschatological salvation. Without stretching what John says, we could reasonably say that eternal life has three phases in John:</p>
<p>
It begins in the ministry of Jesus as the disciples have fellowship with Him;</p>
<p>
It continues in a new dimension after His departure through the indwelling of the Spirit;</p>
<p>
and It will be complete in the future when the disciples have come through their troubles and see the divine glory which Jesus had before the foundation of the world.</p>
<p>
Why is John so different? Theology rather than history?
Our bird's eye view of John's gospel has been very selective, but I hope that it has brought out some of the brilliance of John's thinking.<br> His vision of Jesus as the divine communication (the logos) is an exciting one: the unimaginably great God who made our universe has chosen to reveal Himself in the most personal and accessible form He could, i.e. through a wonderful, real human being. So we have seen the unseen God!<br> His understanding of eternal life as sharing the family life of God, the Father and the Son, is something far more profound than any concept of life that just goes on and on: in a world where happiness is often supposed to derive from material prosperity, we actually know that happiness and unhappiness typically have much more to do with our personal relationships.<br> For John the supreme good is to be in a relationship of love and unity with God and with each other.

The conclusion for those who take this view of John is that the gospel tells us more about how the late first century church viewed Jesus than about what Jesus the prophet from Galilee was actually like. <br>The gospel is a useful source of historical information about early Christianity, but adds very little indeed to our historical knowledge of Jesus.<br> Consequently many modern scholars writing about the history of Jesus hardly refer to John at all.</p>
<h3>
Some evidence from Paul
</h3>
<p>
That point is reinforced when we look at some of Paul's writings.<br> In 1 Cor 1-4 Paul speaks about Christians as people who have received divine revelation. More significantly, Phil 2:5-11 is a famous passage where Paul speaks of Jesus having emptied Himself, taking the form of a servant, going to the cross, and then being highly-exalted. <br>We do not have John's 'descending/ascending' language here, but we have something very like it. <br>Paul sees Jesus as pre-existent; and his 'super-exalt' word is related to the Greek word used in John, when he speaks of Jesus being 'lifted up' on the cross. Many scholars have claimed that Phil 2:5-11 is a hymn that existed before Paul wrote Philippians and which he took over in his letter; in which case we find that 'Johannine' christology was anticipated not just by Paul, but possibly even earlier in the hymns of the early church.</p>
<p>
People have also seen Col 1:15-20 as an early hymn, and it is even more 'Johannine': its description of the pre-existent Jesus as the one through whom God created the world is strikingly similar to the prologue of John's gospel.<br> One particular piece of evidence deriving from Paul and from Mark’s gospel has to do with the word ‘Abba’ (Gal 4:6, Rom 8:15, Mark 14:36). The use of this Aramaic term three times in the Greek New Testament points strongly to the conclusion </p>
<p>
(a) that it goes back to Jesus (note in Gal 4:6 how Paul speaks of the <font color= "blue">Spirit of His Son ... crying Abba, Father)</font>, and</p>
<p> 
(b) that it was distinctive of Jesus; it was not usual for Jews to use this family word when addressing God. Jesus’ use of the word does not prove that he had what we might call a Johannine Christology, but it does show that the Johannine emphasis on Jesus as Son of God is firmly rooted in the teaching of Jesus. </p>
<p>
It turns out that the 'Johannine' theological emphases are not so distinctive, and that they seem to have featured in the very earliest traditions of the Christian church.</p> 
<h3>
Loving one another
</h3>
<p>
The same is true of his ethical teaching about love. John suggests that the command <font color= "blue">"love one another as I have loved you" (John 13:34)</font> was something particularly important for Jesus: it was His new commandment (John 15:12). <br>At first sight this looks quite different from the synoptics, where we find a broader emphasis on loving one's neighbour and even one's enemy.<br> The suspicion is that John has narrowed the focus because of his church context. However, a closer look shows not only that this Johannine emphasis has a parallel in the synoptics (e.g. in Mark 9:33-50 and 10:41-45, with its important stress on service within the Christian fellowship), but also that it is a strong emphasis in Paul's letters, for example in 1 Thes 4 <font color= "blue">"You are all taught of God to love one another" (1 Thes 4:9)(also Rom 12:10)</font>. </p>
<p>
In Paul we find a dual emphasis on loving fellow-Christians and loving others as well (Gal. 6:10, 1 Thes. 5:15); in John it must be admitted that there is more explicit emphasis on the first, but he too can speak of Jesus' mission in terms of God loving the world and of Christians being called to share in that mission (John 3:16, 20:21).</p>
<p>
One particularly interesting text in this connection is Gal 6, where Paul tells the Galatians to <font color= "blue">Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.<br> (Gal 6:2)</font>. Scholars have puzzled over why Paul speaks of the 'law' of Christ in a letter where he mainly stresses freedom from the law. But one real possibility is that Paul knows the tradition of Jesus' new commandment which we find in John – bearing 'one another's' burdens is after all much the same as loving 'one another'.</p> 
<h3>
Believing
</h3>
<p>
And the response that John looked for was 'that you may believe': for John believing is 'believing that' Jesus is the Christ the Son of God, and also 'believing in' him. John expresses 'believing in' in various other ways: thus in John 6 he speaks of the person who <font color= "blue">"comes to me ... and believes in me". (John 6:35)</font> <br>The 'coming' is not just a matter of physical movement, but it is a response of acceptance. <br>Precisely that sort of language is used in the important verses in John 1:<br> <font color= "blue">"He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him. But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God". (John 1:11-13).</font><br> It is by receiving Jesus that people enter the family of Jesus (which is what eternal life is all about), being born again by God's Spirit. </p>
<p>
For John this sort of believing and receiving of Jesus is only possible through the work of God's Spirit. People are naturally blinded by the devil, the prince of this 'world', and so <font color= "blue">"No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him;" (John 6:44).</font> John is under no illusion that preaching Jesus, or writing His gospel, will automatically convert people; indeed he writes in face of a distressing amount of unbelief and false belief.
