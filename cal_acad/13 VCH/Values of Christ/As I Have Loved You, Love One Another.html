   <h1>
As I Have Loved You, <br>Love One Another
</h1>
<h3>
The New Commandment
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
So, when he had gone out, Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man is 

glorified, and God is glorified in Him. If God is glorified in 

Him, God will also glorify Him in Himself, and glorify Him 

immediately. Little children, I shall be with you a little while 

longer. You will seek Me; and as I said to the Jews, "Where I am 

going, you cannot come," so now I say to you. A new commandment I 

give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that 

you also love one another. By this all will know that you are My 

disciples, if you have love for one another.”
Simon Peter said to Him, “Lord, where are You going?” Jesus 

answered him, “Where I am going you cannot follow Me now, but you 

shall follow Me afterwards.”
Peter said to Him, “Lord, why can I not follow You now? I will 

lay down my life for Your sake.” Jesus answered him, “Will you 

lay down your life for My sake? Most assuredly, I say to you, the 

rooster shall not crow till you have denied Me three times.” 

(John 13:31-38)</font></p>
<p>
It is the night before Jesus is crucified. The twelve apostles 

are eating with Jesus that most important of all meals.<br> Jesus had 

just said <font color= "blue">“Most assuredly, I say to you, one 

of you will betray Me.” (John 13:21)</font> <br>Then, leaning back on 

Jesus’ breast, he said to Him, <font color= "blue">“Lord, who is 

it?” <br>(John 13:25)</font> <br>Jesus answered, probably in a low voice 

so that only John could hear <br>(since when Judas left the others 

had no idea what was going on, John 13:29) <br><font color= "blue">“It is he to whom I 

will give this morsel of bread when I have dipped it”<br> (John 

13:26)</font>. <br>Then he dipped the bread and gave it to Judas. And said 

<font color= "blue">“What you are going to do, do quickly” (John 13:27)</font>. In John 

13:30 Judas leaves.

And the next thing Jesus says is, <font color= "blue">“Now is the Son of 

Man glorified, and God is glorified in him.” (John 13:31)</font><br> At the very moment 

when the final betrayal has been set in motion — at that moment 

Jesus says, “Now.” “Now is the Son of Man glorified.” Now. Now 

that the final process of being handed over to be killed is in 

motion, now the Son of Man, Jesus, will shine with the greatest 

glory. And God will shine gloriously in Him.</p>
<h3>
John Felt the Amazement
</h3>
<p>
Of all the disciples, only John could at this moment feel the 

full amazement at this. John had heard Jesus say that Judas was 

the one — the betrayer. <br>At that moment he must have been utterly 

stunned. Judas. The one we’ve trusted with the money these three 

years (John 13:29). Suddenly, in a flash, a whole cluster of 

Judas' peculiar behaviors take on a whole new meaning. <br>So this is 

why he gave Mary such a hard time for anointing Jesus with 

expensive anointment (John 12:3–6). He wanted her to give that to 

Jesus, so he would have access to it.<br>

John watches Judas leave, and he can't believe what he is 

watching. And while John’s mind is churning the incredible news 

that Judas is a betrayer, and may be doing his foul work at this 

very moment, he hears Jesus say, “Now is the Son of Man 

glorified.” And another boulder is thrown into the churning 

waters of his mind. Glory! Now! Judas. Betrayal. Glory. And in 

what must have been one of the most emotionally charged moments 

of John’s life, the next word he heard was, “Little children”.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Little children, I shall be with you a little while longer. You will seek Me; and as I said to the Jews, "Where I am going, you cannot come," so now I say to you. A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another; as I have loved you, that you also love one another. By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.” (John 13:33-35)</font></p>
<h3>
Called "Little Children"
</h3>
<p>
So here’s John with his heart bursting with conflicting emotions:<br> 

Betrayal has been put in motion. The glory of God is about to be 

seen.<br> Jesus is leaving them. And, in His absence, love for each 

other is to bind them together and bind them to Him. And in a 

moment of conflicting and intensified emotion, Jesus reaches for 

a word of singular affection and calls them all “little children” .</p>
<p>
Does this tell us anything? I think it tells us that this moment 

in the life John the apostle was so profound, and so moving, and 

so memorable that it left its mark years later not only on the 

writing of this story, but on his entire first epistle <br>(1 John). <br>

And 1 John therefore becomes our earliest and most authoritative 

commentary on Jesus' new commandment.<p>
<h3>
An Apostolic Commentary
</h3>
<p>
Consider a few things. This word “little children” occurs only 

here in the Gospel of John. There were other places it could have 

been used, as when Jesus called out to the disciples, <font color= "blue">“Children, do you have any food?” (John 21:5)</font>. Only here, does He call His friends “little children.”

Not only is this the only place these words are used in John. It is 

the only place it is used in the entire New Testament — except 

for one book. John’s first letter. And there it is used seven 

times in five chapters. Just as Jesus called his friends “little 

children” the word becomes John’s favourite name for his flock, 

“little children.” A coincidence? Perhaps.</p>
<p>
But consider this. Nowhere else in the New Testament does the 

term “new commandment” occur outside this story — except in 

John’s first and second letter. Of all the New Testament writers 

only John picked up on this term.</p>
<p>
<font color= "blue">Brethren, I write no new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you heard from the beginning. Again, a new commandment I write to you, which thing is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining.. (1 John 2:7–8)</font>.<br>
So I feel constrained to believe that John was profoundly moved 

and shaped by this moment at the last supper. And the connections 

with his first letter incline me to think that the earliest and 

most authoritative commentary on the new commandment in John 

13:34­–35 is what John says about it in his first letter.

Here are two striking things about the way John handles Jesus’

new commandment.</p>
<h3>
The Love of God — Our Model
</h3>
<p>
First, nowhere in any of his letters does John refer directly to 

the love of Jesus for His disciples. So he never says: "Love each 

other the way Jesus loved you." He always talks about the love of 

God for His children. The love of the Father. When Jesus comes 

into the picture, the point is: <br>God loved us in giving Jesus to 

us. And when it comes to the one we should model our love on, 

John doesn’t say Love like Jesus. He says, Love like God:<br>
<font color= "blue">
In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. (1 John 4:10–11)</font>.<br>
What are we to make of this? What I make of it is that this is 

exactly the way I would expect the writer of the John’s Gospel to 

talk. As John thought back on that moment with the betrayal in 

motion, the glory of God about to shine, Jesus leaving, and love 

binding, what overcomes him is the thought: <br>I was leaning on the 

shoulder of God. God had put Judas in motion.<br> God was about to be 

glorified on the cross. God told us to love each other like Jesus 

— that is, like God.</p>
<p>
So in his first letter, John isn’t minimising Jesus when he puts 

all the focus on the love of God in Jesus. He is maximising 

Jesus. This Jesus who gave us the new commandment and told us to 

love each other the way He loved us — this Jesus is God 

incarnate. And John could not get over the truth:<br> God was loving 

us there that night. God was loving us the next morning.<br> Every 

act of Jesus, the Son, was an act of God the Father. John is not 

saying the love of Jesus is not important; he is saying the love of

Jesus is the love of God. So when the new commandment says, Love 

each other as I have loved you, it means: as God has loved 

you.</p>
<h3>
This Is How You'll Know
</h3>
<p>
And here’s a second striking thing about the way John handles the 

new commandment.<br>Jesus said  <font color= "blue">“By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.” (John 13:35)</font><br> 

John pondered very deeply the phrase “My disciples” and 

what must happen for that to be known. And what he concluded was 

that being a disciple means being truly born again. To be a 

disciple is not just to be outwardly aligned with a Christian 

church or a Christian movement or a Christian name, but 

miraculously changed by the Spirit into a person with a new heart 

of love for the Father and for Jesus and for his followers (and, 

of course, for his enemies, but John’s emphasis falls on loving 

fellow believers, just like Jesus did — (that 

you also love one another John 13:34). And love is how you can know this has 

happened.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Beloved, let us love one another, for love is of God, and 

everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. (1 John 4:7)</font><br>
<font color= "blue">We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brethren. (1 John 3:14)</font> <br>
<font color= "blue">In this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother. (1 John 3:10)</font><br>
<font color= "blue">Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love.<br> (1 John 4:8)</font><br>
<font color= "blue">"He who says he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness until now. He who loves his brother abides in the light,” (1 John 2:9–10)</font>.</font><br>
Or as Jesus says <font color= "blue">“By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another.” (John 13:35)</font> <br>

All people will have good evidence that you are born of God and know 

God and are a child of God and are in the light and no longer in 

the darkness. <br>People will know you are truly a disciple of Jesus 

by whether you have been given a new heart of trust in Jesus and 

love for His followers.</p>
<h3>
Embedded in the Call
</h3>
<p>
And I don’t put the word “trust” there just because that’s right 

thing to do. I included it because when John thought about the 

new commandment he knew that the new commandment was not an 

isolated commandment to love, but a commandment embedded in the 

call of Jesus to trust Him as the sin-bearing Lamb of God for 

everything we need. And we know that because John said <font color= "blue"><br>“And this is His commandment, that we believe in the name 

of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as He has commanded us.” (1 John 3:23) </font></p>
<p>
In other words, in John’s mind, Jesus’ command to believe on Him, 

and His command to love each other are inseparable. So together 

he calls them one commandment: “This is His commandment 

[singular], that we believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ 

and love one another, just as He has commanded us.” People won’t 

know you are a disciple of Jesus if you make no profession of 

faith in Jesus. <br>But if you declare yourself openly to be a 

disciple of Jesus — your Saviour, your Lord, your Treasure — then 

your love for others will be decisive in showing that you are 

real. Are you a true believer? Are you really a disciple?<br>Is He 

really your treasure? Have you really been changed by Jesus? <br>They 

will all know <font color= "blue">“if you have love for one another” (John 13:35)</font>. <br>So 

when Jesus says, <font color= "blue">"By this all will know that you are My disciples, if you have love for one another," (John 13:35)</font> He 

meant, love confirms that your profession of faith in Me is 

real.</p>
<h3>
What Makes This New?
</h3>
<p>
Why is it that love proves discipleship? Why is it that when 

disciples love each other there is such good evidence that they 

are true disciples of Jesus?<br> Why is this one-another-love so 

compelling? The answer comes when we ponder why Jesus calls this 

commandment new. If we see what makes the commandment new, we 

will see what makes it have such compelling power to prove true 

discipleship, true faith in Jesus.</p>
<p>
The command to love each other is not new in and of itself. said, <font color= "blue">“You shall not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbour as yourself: I am the Lord.” (Lev 19:18 )</font> <br>
<font color= "blue">
“Just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another.” (John 13:34b)</font> Never before had the Son of God come into the world and laid down His life for His people. That had never 

happened before. This degree of greatness making this degree of 

sacrifice, had never happened. This is new.<br>

So is Jesus simply saying: If you imitate this kind of sacrifice 

in loving each other, you will be fulfilling the newness of this 

commandment?</p>
<h3>
More Than Imitation
</h3>
<p>
If we listen to what John says in his first letter about what 

makes this commandment new, we see there’s more going on than 

imitation. <br>Here’s the way John puts it:
<font color= "blue"><br>
Again, a new commandment I write to you, which thing is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining. (1 John 2:8) </font><br>
In other words, what makes this love new is that it is the 

arrival of the glory of the Lord — the Light of the world — that 

will one day fill the earth as the waters cover the sea. When the 

Messiah comes and brings His kingdom, <br><font color= "blue">“The earth will be filled 

with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord as the waters cover 

the sea” (Hab 2:14).</font><br>And Jesus is the Messiah. His coming was the 

dawn of the kingdom of God.<br> He was the Light of the world. <font color= "blue">Jesus said, “Now the Son of Man is glorified, and God is glorified in Him (John 13:31)</font> <br>

This night the light would shine most brightly 

when He lays down His life for His friends.</p>
<p>
<font color= "blue">
And then John says, “Whoever 

says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in 

darkness. Whoever loves his brother abides in the light.” (1 John 2:9–10)</font><br> In 

other words, what makes the disciples love for each other new — 

and this command for it new — is that they are not just copying 

the light, they are in this light. They are in the love of Jesus.<br> 

This is how John sees the newness of this love.

Jesus said, <font color= "blue">“Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life for his friends.” (John 15:13).</font><br> That’s what happened 

that night and the next morning. And John says that what makes 

that new — and what makes the commandment new — is this love was 

the arrival of the Light of God — the glory of God — at the end 

of the age to fill the earth. And the commandment for us to love 

each other just as Jesus loved, was not mainly a command for 

imitation, but for participation. John says, “Whoever loves his 

brother abides in the light.” When we love each other in 

obedience to the new commandment, we are loving each other with 

the love of Jesus. His love is being perfected in our love. This 

is not mainly imitation, but manifestation. Our lives are in 

Jesus, in the Light, and our love is His love.</p>
<h3>
Loving with His Love
</h3>
<p>
Jesus comes back to this in John 15 and makes the meaning clear: 
<font color= "blue">
“This is My commandment, that you love one another as I have 

loved you. Greater love has no one than this, than to lay 

down one’s life for his friends” (John 15:12–13)</font>. Yes. And how do 

we love like that? <font color= "blue">“As the Father has loved Me, so 

have I loved you. Abide in my love.” (John 15:9)</font><br>

This is our newness. This is the new commandment. “Just as I have 

loved you, you also are to love one another.” Yes. But not by 

copying My fruit, but by connecting to My vine. You don’t mainly 

imitate. You participate. Your love for each other is not a 

simulation of Mine, but a manifestation of Mine. You are the 

branches. I am the vine. If you abide in Me, you can bear fruit, 

and prove to be My disciples. This is how all people 

know you are truly My disciples. <br>(John 15:5,8)</p>
<p>
So the reason the love we have for each other shows that we are 

truly Jesus’ disciples, is that it is only possible because we 

are grafted into the life and love of Christ. We love as He 

loved, because we love with His love.</p>
<p>
So,“my little children!” — in these crucial days, 

these historic days in the life of our church, this is what Jesus 

is calling for among us. “Just as I have loved you, that you 

love one another.”<br> Go low in foot-washing-like service 

to one another.<br> Lay down your lives, your privileges, for one 

another.<br> Love your brothers and sisters across all racial and 

ethnic lines. <br>Love the weakest and oldest and youngest.<br> Love the 

disabled. <br>Love the lonely trouble maker.<br> It is certain when you 

love that you cannot atone for anyone’s sin. <br>But you can do 

something like it, because <font color= "blue">“love will cover a multitude of sins.” (1 

Peter 4:8)</font>. <br>How blessed the church — especially the church in 

transition — that loves like this!<p><img src="../../../images/content/Adobe-Photoshop-Old-icon.png" width="30" height="30" hspace="25" vspace="10" border="0" align="center"alt="> </p>
