The Prayer of a Sinner

<h3>
Pharisees and Tax Collectors 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"He spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others: “Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector." (Luke 18:9-10)</font></p>
<p>
The Pharisee and the tax collector were complete social opposites.<br>
Pharisees were members of an exacting party of the Jews who believed in strictly observing God's law. The tax collectors, on the other hand, followed another law entirely -- the law of the Roman oppressors. It was their job to collect taxes for the Romans. They worked on a tax farming system. Chief tax collectors bid on the contract for collecting taxes for a certain district. If they won the contract they would be responsible for delivering to the Romans the amount of money agreed upon. Then these chief tax collectors would employ others who resided in the various villages and sections of town to collect the tolls, taxes, and tariffs.</p>
<p>
Tax collectors weren't just hated because they were considered turncoats and traitors. They were also considered cheaters. They would sometimes assess more taxes than was legal. If a farmer or businessman or caravanner couldn't or wouldn't pay, they would turn him over to the soldiers. Extortion and threats were part of this system. Tax collectors were considered the scum of the earth.</p>
<p>
It isn't hard to see the contrast between them -- the righteous Pharisee and the morally bankrupt, turncoat tax collector.</p>
<h3>
Priding Oneself 
</h3>
<p>
Now Jesus, the storyteller, sets the figures into action.<br>
<font color= "blue">
"The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, "God, I thank You that I am not like other men—extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector. I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I possess." (Luke 18:11-12)</font>
But his entire prayer is about himself. He thanks God -- not for blessings -- but that he isn't a sinner like others. He first lists those who were known to be evil: 
(1) robbers "swindlers or rogues" 
(2) evildoers, unrighteous people in general, and 
(3) adulterers. Then he compares himself to 
(4) the nearby tax collector.<br>

He also reminds God of how pious he is -- fasting and tithing. Pharisees developed the practice of fasting on Mondays and Thursdays to intercede for the nation as a whole.[6] Pharisees far exceeded the requirements of the law in this regard. They scrupulously tithed or gave one tenth on everything they acquired, even down to the herbs in their garden. As Jesus tells the story, I can almost hear a ripple of laughter sweep over the crowd. They all recognise the type of Pharisee Jesus is describing, and are amused. Jesus' description might have been a slight caricature of the Pharisees, but not too much of a stretch.</p>
<h3>
No Excuses 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"And the tax collector, standing afar off, would not so much as raise his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me a sinner!" (Luke 18:13)</font>
Notice the tax collector's posture. Jesus describes three kinds of body language before he voices the tax collector's prayer:

Standing at a distance. He doesn't feel worthy to draw close to God or the temple.
Not raising his eyes to heaven, but standing with head level or bowed, as a sign of his sense of guilt.
Beating his breast. Though we don't see many instances of this in scripture is a sign of mourning, Josephus, a Pharisee who lived a few decades after Jesus, described David's mourning for his son Absalom in this way: "David ... wept for his son, and beat his breast, tearing [the hair of] his head, tormenting himself all manner of ways ..."
The tax collector's prayer is remarkable and short. First, he addresses God, just as the Pharisee had done.

Next, instead of telling God all the good things about himself, he describes himself as a sinner, behaviour or activity that does not measure up to standard moral or cultic expectations. Notice that he makes no excuses for his behaviour, offers no mitigating circumstances. He is confessing his sinfulness before God and taking full responsibility for it.

Finally, he asks for mercy. 
For the tax collector to ask for forgiveness and restoration of his relationship with God is a bold and faith-filled act for a man so despised by his society. He is obviously humble and repentant of his sins, but his faith has made him bold to ask for something that he has no right to expect -- forgiveness and restoration before God.</p>
<h3>
Justification before God 
</h3>
<p>
Having contrasted the Pharisee's self-righteous and disdainful piety with the tax collector's sincere and faith-filled penitence, Jesus pronounces judgement:

"I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other;" (Luke 18:14)
Can you imagine the impact Jesus' parable had on the Pharisees present? They must have been livid with anger. How about the crowd? They were amazed, wondering, pondering. But the prostitutes and tax collectors, thieves and adulterers in the audience may have been weeping, for Jesus had declared that it was possible for them to be saved, to be forgiven, to be cleansed, to be justified before God. There was hope for them yet. Jesus had given them hope.
<h3>
Exalting or Humbling Oneself 
</h3>
<p>
Finally, Jesus brings home the application of the parable, the point, the meaning:

"... for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted." (Luke 18:14)
Jesus highlights a paradox of the spiritual life -- exalting oneself leads to humbling, while humbling leads to exaltation. Jesus' brother James carries on this theme when he says:<font color= "blue"> "... But He gives more grace. Therefore He says: “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble." (James 4:6)</font> When we are proud, we make ourselves into God's opponent, His enemy.</p>
<h3>
Disciple Lessons
</h3>
<p>
The lessons for would-be disciples are obvious.

We are saved by God's atonement and mercy, not by our righteous deeds.
God abhors the haughty, but welcomes the humble. I can see myself here. I must guard against the sin of pride that is so repugnant to God. Instead, I must humble myself and be thankful for the grace of God.
We cannot, we must not look down on others. While they may be sinners, they are certainly not beyond God's forgiveness. In the final analysis the only thing that saves either of us will be God's forgiveness, and not our pure lifestyle.
Is Jesus trying to undermine piety and obedience? By no means! But this parable attacks with a vengeance any pride and sense of superiority that our piety and obedience may foster.

Jesus is laying the groundwork for the kind of people whom God accepts. The Parable of the Widow and the Unjust Judge (Luke 18:1-8) teaches the importance of persistent faith, while this parable teaches the importance of humility before God, and the story of Jesus and the children that follows this (Luke 18:15-17) underscores this point. Faith and humility are marks of the men and women who follow Jesus. May they be earmarks of your character and mine, as well!</p>
<h3>
Prayer
</h3>
<p>
Father, we live in such a wicked world. It's so easy for us to develop an ugly pride in our piety and look down on others. I can see that tendency in me. Forgive me. Cleanse me. Please help me to humble myself before you that I me enjoy the comfort of your mercy rather than the sting of your judgement. In Jesus' name, I pray. Amen.</p>
