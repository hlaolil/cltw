<h3>
Love Thy Neighbour? 
</h3>
<p>
"Love thy neighbour" is a term that's become almost clichéd over the years. But where did it originate, and what does it really mean? In a time when neighbours, are people we rarely see (thanks to garage door openers and busy lives), or are thought of as nuisances with barking dogs and noisy children, how can we possibly love our neighbours?</p>
<h3>
Love thy neighbour - Christ's Answer to Religion
</h3>
<p>
Love thy neighbour was, in part, Jesus' answer when the Pharisees, the chief religious sect of that day, asked Him about the greatest commandment in the Law. These religious leaders had made almost an art form of classifying all the various laws and giving them relative degrees of importance, so in asking Jesus this question, their aim was to test Him. His answer stunned them: <font color= "blue">Jesus said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbour as yourself. On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.” (Matt 22:36-40)</font></p>
<p>
Jesus was summing up all the law in these two statements. If we love the Lord God with all our heart, soul and mind, loving our neighbour is the natural result. The question then is, who is our neighbour, and how do we love him or her?<br> 

Let's look at who Jesus says our neighbour is: <font color= "blue">“You have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbour and hate your enemy. But I say to you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you (Matt 5:43-44).</font> 

Is our neighbour more than the guy next door? Could he or she be someone in our community or almost anyone we meet? Could our enemies also be our neighbours? Jesus says that it's so. But how can we love someone who acts hatefully toward us? 

When we love God with all our heart, soul, mind and strength, we grow to recognise that everyone is part of His creation. Will everyone be in heaven? No, but that's not because God doesn't desire that to be the case. His Word tells us that God desires that all would be saved (1 Tim 2:4). So it's clear that God sees all of us as potential children. Because He lives outside of time and has seen the end from the beginning, He also knows who will choose salvation and who will not. For us, that is where faith comes in. It is not for us to know who will choose Him and who will not, but we are called to be His witnesses. In order to fulfil that calling, we must love others enough to desire their salvation just as He does. 

Here's the good news for those who find this teaching difficult: Nowhere does it say we have to like our neighbour! 

As for the how part of this formula, we turn to these words from the Apostle Paul. Paul says:

Owe no one anything except to love one another, for he who loves another has fulfilled the law. For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery,” “You shall not murder,” “You shall not steal,” “You shall not bear false witness,” “You shall not covet,” and if there is any other commandment, are all summed up in this saying, namely, “You shall love your neighbour as yourself.” Love does no harm to a neighbour; therefore love is the fulfilment of the law." (Rom 13:8-10)</p>

Love Thy neighbour - Get to Know Jesus
</h3>
<p>
"Love thy neighbour" is not as hard as it looks on the surface. It simply means respecting others and regarding their needs and desires as highly as we regard our own. Keeping this commandment, however, is likely to require the supernatural assistance only God, through Christ, can provide.</p> 
<p>
How can we learn to love the guy next door with the barking dog, especially when we don't even like him? Perhaps the secret is to recognise that our neighbour, whether it's the guy next door, the checker at the local grocery store, or the Sunday school teacher at church, is someone as worthy of God's love as you or I. John 1:14 is expressed as follows:<br>
The Word became flesh and blood, and moved into the neighbourhood. We saw the glory with our own eyes, the one-of-a-kind glory, like Father, like Son, Generous inside and out, true from start to finish.
Could it be that the way we love our neighbour is through getting to know Christ, the living Word of God? It's human nature to emulate those we admire most, so in getting to know Christ, we'll discover a God worthy of our whole-hearted love, and our neighbour will see that love in us.
