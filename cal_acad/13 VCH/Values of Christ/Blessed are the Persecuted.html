   <h1>
Blessed are the Persecuted
</h1>
<h3>
What does Jesus mean?
</h3>
<p>
What does Jesus mean when He says, <font color= "blue">“Blessed are those who are persecuted ... “Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you, and say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake.”? (Matt 5:10-11)</font></p>
<p>
We should first look at what Jesus doesn’t mean.<br>

Do you have a bucket list? A bucket list is a list of things you want to do before you kick the bucket. People have created lists with all kinds of goals: to own a Ferrari, to visit exotic locations, to parachute, and more.<br> 

So here’s what Jesus isn’t saying. He isn’t saying that we should add “experience persecution” to our bucket list. This is not a command from Jesus to go out and look for persecution. So rest easy: I will not be telling you to go out tomorrow and try to look for ways to be persecuted at work and at school. <br>I won’t be telling you that unless your neighbours hate you, you’re obviously doing something wrong. That’s what He’s not saying.</p>
<p>
But don’t get too comfortable, because this Beatitude hints at something that Jesus says repeatedly elsewhere: We may not aim to experience persecution, but those who are part of His kingdom will experience it. So don’t look for it, don’t aim to experience it, but know that it’s coming. Jesus said, for instance:
<p><font color= "blue">
"You will be hated by all for My name's sake". (Matt 10:22)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Remember the word that I said to you: A servant is not greater than his master. If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you. If they kept My word, they will also keep yours also. (John 15:20)</font></p>
<p>
<font color= "blue">
These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.” (John 16:33)</font></p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul later wrote:
<font color= "blue">
For to you it has been granted on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake, (Phil 1:29)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.<br> (2 Tim 3:12)</font></p>
<p>
Jesus’ kingdom has arrived and is breaking into history here and now.<br> As His kingdom breaks into this world, there is a clash of two kingdoms.<br> And as those two kingdoms clash, members of Christ’s kingdom will inevitably get caught up in the clash.

If you have come under the kingship of Jesus, you’ve fallen into a larger story. And that story is the story of a clash of kingdoms. So Jesus isn’t saying that we should go looking for persecution, but He says that we will experience it as citizens of His in-breaking kingdom.</p>
<h3>
Why we will be persecuted
</h3>
<p>
In fact, Jesus gives us the reasons we’ll be persecuted. It will be for righteousness sake. But He also says that people will say false things about us. When persecuted, they probably won’t say, “I’m persecuting you because you are such a good, righteous person.” Early Christians were charged with being immoral, atheists, and enemies of the state. They were charged with being immoral because they kept talking about loving their brothers and sisters. <br>They were charged with being atheists because they refused to worship the Roman gods. They were charged with being enemies of the state because they said that Jesus, not Caesar, is Lord. None of the charges were true.<br> When persecuted, the charge will always be something else.<br> You won’t be charged with being righteous, but you may be accused of being intolerant or disloyal or not a team player.</p>
<p>
This is actually an important part of what it means to be on mission.<br> If you’re not on mission, you probably won’t be persecuted.<br> You’re not persecuted for retreating from the world; you’re only persecuted as you engage it.<br> Sri Lankan missionary Ajith Fernando said this a couple of years ago:<br>
The West is fast becoming an out of reach region. The Bible and history show that suffering is an essential ingredient in reaching out of reach people.<br> Will the loss of a theology of suffering lead the Western church to become ineffective in evangelism? ... Christians in both the East and the West need to have a firm theology of suffering if they are to be healthy and bear fruit.</p>
<p>
This message is especially relevant for us as we think about God’s call to join Him on mission. That mission entails suffering. The suffering may not be as severe as it is in other parts of the world, but it will happen. We may face rejection and hatred as we tell others about Jesus.<br> We may be fired because we refuse to follow dishonest practices that are routine at work. We may face hostility because people think we’re intolerant. <br>The more we are on mission, the more likely it is that we’ll experience persecution.</p>
<p>
Jesus isn’t saying that we should go looking for persecution, but He is saying that we will experience it. And when we do, He’s saying that we can consider ourselves blessed. <br>I love how N.T. Wright puts it: it’s a “summons to live in the present in the way that will make sense in God’s promised future, because that future has arrived in the present in Jesus of Nazareth.” Jesus is saying we can live in line with His kingdom even when it leads to a clash with rival kingdoms, and we can consider ourselves blessed even when persecuted. That’s what He is saying: we can be blessed even when persecuted. That’s what it means.</p>
