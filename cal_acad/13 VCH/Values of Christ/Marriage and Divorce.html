Marriage and Divorce

<h3>
The Bible Alone Is the Ultimate Standard of Truth
</h3>
<p>
Jesus clearly taught that the Bible is ultimate and only standard of truth and of right and wrong. Jesus said that we are to live by <font color= "blue">"every word that  proceeds from the mouth of God"> (Matt. 4:4,Deut 8:3)</font> and by no other words. <br>In John 17 Jesus prays to His heavenly Father: <font color= "blue">"Sanctify them by Your truth. Your word is truth." (John 17:17)</font> Jesus did not say: "Your word is true" instead He said that God's Word is truth itself. Thus the Bible does not conform to a higher standard of truth but rather is truth itself, the very expression of the nature, character, and will of God because it is the very words of God <br>(2 Tim 3:15-17). What the Bible says, God says. So the Bible is the measuring stick by which every other claim to truthfulness is to be measured.<br> Teachings that conform to Scripture are true; those that do not are false. <br>Truth is what God says, not what men think (Col 2:20-23).</p>
<p>
Jesus condemned the Pharisees for teaching their own opinions and laws as if they were God's (Matt 15:9). He called their teaching "heavy loads," which they tied up and put on men's shoulders (Matt 23:4), thereby unduly burdening them. Those who accepted such extra-biblical laws were considered to be under the yoke of the Pharisees teaching and thereby their disciples (Acts 15:5, 10). Those who try to impose such a yoke are said to "test God" (Acts 15:10). Therefore Jesus invites all people who labour under the yoke of extra-biblical rules and regulations to come to Him so He can give them two things: rest and a new yoke—His way of discipleship—which is easy and light because the rest He provides is the supernatural, divine rest of intimacy with Him that refreshes <br>(cf. Jer. 6:16) and strengthens (Matt 11:28-30) those who like Jesus approach God with meek and humble hearts. Jesus' words "I will give you rest" echo the words <font color= "blue">"My Presence will go with you, and I will give you rest" in Ex 33:14</font>.</p>
<p>
So what we need to do is find out what the Bible teaches about divorce and remarriage. Are there biblical grounds for divorce? If so, what are they?<br> Does the Bible permit divorced people to remarry? If so, under what conditions? These are the pertinent questions.</p>
<h3>
Are There Biblical Grounds for Divorce?
</h3>
<p>
According to Jesus, God's intention is for a marriage to last until, as we would say, "death do you part." Divorce is not part of God's original plan for marriages (Matt 19:3-8). Jesus narrowed the Old Testament grounds for divorce from petty fault finding (Deut 24:1-4) to a single condition (Matt 5:31-32; 19:7-9).</p>
<p>
According to Jesus, the one and the only legitimate ground for divorce is physical marital unfaithfulness, that is, any sort of physical sexual immorality, including but not restricted to adultery (Matt 5:32). <br>I say "physical" to distinguish what Jesus is saying from the sort of sexual immorality we can commit in our hearts. Sinning in our hearts is not a biblical ground for divorce. According to Jesus, for a man to divorce his wife for any reason other than sexual immorality (for example, incompatibility, "falling out of love") makes her an adulteress and her new husband an adulterer <br>(Matt 5:32; 19:9). The assumption behind these words is that the divorced wife will remarry and have sexual relations with her new husband, even though in God's eyes she is not legitimately divorced from her first husband.</p>
<p>
Jesus gives what is called His famous "exception clause" here<font color= "blue"> whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality,... (Matt 19:9)</font>. <br>What is the meaning of porneia ("marital unfaithfulness"; "fornication")? <br>Some relate it to incest. Others have argued that it refers to premarital sex: <br>if a man discovers his bride is not a virgin, he may divorce her. <br>Still others hold that it means "adultery" here, no more and no less. </p>
<p>
It must be admitted that the word porneia itself is very broad.<br> Occasionally it can refer to a specific kind of sexual sin, but only because the specific sexual sin belongs to the larger category of sexual immorality.<br> Porneia covers the entire range of sexual sins and should not be restricted unless the context requires it.</p>
<p>
Consequently, what Jesus seems to be saying is that divorce and remarriage always involve evil; but as Moses permitted it because of the hardness of human hearts, so also does He—but now on the sole grounds of porneia (sexual sin of any sort).<br> Admittedly, Jesus would appear to be abrogating something of the Mosaic prescription; for whatever the general "something indecent" refers to in <br>Deut. 24:1, it can hardly refer to adultery, for which the prescribed punishment was death. But porneia includes adultery as a sexual sin, even if not restricted to it. Jesus' judgements on the matter are therefore both lighter (no capital punishment for adultery) and heavier (the sole exception being some form of sexual sin) than Moses. </p>
<p>
Thus Jesus permits but does not require divorce in the case of adultery.<br> In the case of adultery, it is not wrong for the offended party to divorce the offending party (Matt 5:31-32; 19:9). But forgiveness, reconciliation, and continuing love are a higher and better way to resolve the problem—a way that mirrors the Lord's own faithfulness to us despite the untold ways we are unfaithful to Him (see 1 Cor 13:4-8a).</p>
<p>
In 1 Cor 7:10-16 Paul presents a second ground for divorce, one that has to do with mixed marriages. <font color= "blue">If the unbeliever departs, let him depart; a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases." (1 Cor 7:15)</font>. What do "departs" and "not under bondage" mean? "Departs" refers to wilful desertion or abandonment that cannot result in reconciliation because of the wishes of the deserting party. According to Paul, like adultery, this also breaks the marriage contract. <br>In the case of desertion, the believer is not putting away the unbeliever, which would be a breach of Matt 19:3-9, but is being deserted by the unbeliever.<br> For the meaning of "not under bondage," see below under "Does the Bible Permit Divorced People to Remarry?"</p>
<p>
But there will sometimes be relationships in which one partner or the other will not respond to love and will reject commitment to the other. <br>In such cases, in which heart commitment to covenant love is consistently rejected, a legal divorce may follow. In such cases it is not the divorce that is the sin, but the sin that necessitates the divorce. God, then, has provided divorce for those whose marriages have already been destroyed by the hardness of a human heart ... The inability to give and receive love—something that may be imposed by a loveless childhood home—is probably the greatest destroyer of marriages today. </p>
<h3>
Does the Bible Permit Divorced People to Remarry?
</h3>
<p>
The Bible counsels younger widows "to marry, to have children, to manage their homes and to give the enemy no opportunity for slander" (1 Tim 5:14).<br>Thus in the case of widows (and one assumes by analogy, widowers), remarriage not only is permitted, it is encouraged.</p>
<p>
Elsewhere regarding widows, Paul said: <font color= "blue">"But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they remain even as I am;" (1 Cor 7:8)</font>.<br> He said this <font color= "blue">because of the present distress" (1 Cor 7:26)</font>—perhaps a pending persecution and accompanying curtailment of freedom to witness—because he wanted to spare people suffering by encouraging singleness (1 Cor 7:28), because <font color= "blue">"the time [for doing the Lord's work] is short" (1 Cor 7:29)</font>, because the present <font color= "blue">form of the world is passing away (1 Cor 7:31)</font>, and because he wanted them to be free from cares so <font color= "blue">he may please the Lord (1 Cor 7:32)</font>. Unmarried people can concentrate with undivided interest on pleasing the Lord, rather than their marriage partner, and devote themselves to the Lord in body and spirit (1 Cor 7:32-35). However in 1 Cor 7, Paul does not forbid widows to remarry. Although for the sake of doing God's work it is good for them not to remarry, Paul does not say it is wrong for them to remarry. In fact he says if their sexual urge is uncontrollable, they should marry, <font color= "blue">"for it is better to marry than to burn with passion" (1 Cor 7:9)</font>.<br> Both Jesus (Matt 19:11-12) and Paul (1 Cor 7:7) note that celibacy is a divine gift, not a requirement. Like celibacy, marriage also is a gift (1 Cor 7:7).<br>God gifts different individuals in different ways (Rom 12:6).</p>
<p>
If it is permissible for widows to remarry, what about divorcees? <br>Some people have argued that Mark 10 (cf. Luke 16:18) forbids remarriage after divorce on the grounds that such remarriage is adultery: <font color= "blue">"Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her. And if a woman divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.” (Mark 10:11-12)</font> Some have taken these verses to mean that unlike Matthew's quotation of Jesus in Matt 19:9, Mark quotes Jesus in such a way as to prohibit remarriage after divorce for any reason. But Mark's reporting of Jesus words about divorce draws attention to something unique in the annals of Jewish teaching. <br>Unlike the Old Testament or the Rabbis, Jesus taught that a man could commit adultery against his wife.</p>
<p>
In rabbinic Judaism a woman by infidelity could commit adultery against her husband; and a man, by having sexual relations with another man's wife, could commit adultery against that other man. But a man could never commit adultery against his wife. Jesus, by putting the husband under the same moral obligation as the wife, raised the status and dignity of women. Furthermore, Jesus went on to recognise the right of a woman to divorce her husband (Mark 10:12), a right not recognised in Judaism. Matthew, writing for Jews, omits Mark 10:12; but Mark, writing for Romans, includes it." 
Thus unlike Matt 19:9, Mark 10:11-12 does not reflect on the legal situation created by adultery but on the abrogation of the Mosaic provision for divorce (Deut 24:1ff) and the practice of divorce among Jews and Gentiles.</p>
<p>
Some people have argued that Paul declares any remarriage after divorce to be adultery, and therefore wrong, citing Rom 7 as proof: <font color= "blue">"So then if, while her husband lives, she marries another man, she will be called an adulteress;" <br>(Rom 7:3) </font>This is a misinterpretation of this text. To establish the pivot point for his analogy about Christians' relation to the law (Rom. 7:4ff.), Paul states that women in Jewish society were bound by law to remain married to their husbands, for women in this society had no legal right to divorce (Rom 7:2). <br>The only way out of a marriage for a woman in Jewish society was through the death of her husband (Rom 7:2, 3b). Thus when Paul says: "if, while her husband lives, she marries another man, she will be called an adulteress" <br>(Rom 7:3) he does not imply that a divorce has taken place, since the wife could not divorce her husband. He is simply saying that if a married Jewish wife marries another man while her husband is alive, she is committing adultery because she still is married to her first husband.</p>
<p>
As we have seen, Jesus' words in Matt 5:32 and 19:9 permit divorce for the cause of adultery. For a husband to divorce his wife for any reason other than adultery makes her an adulteress should she remarry, and vice versa should the wife divorce the husband for adultery (Mark 10:12). The clear inference is that to divorce because of adultery does not make the other partner an adulteress or adulterer should he or she remarry because the original marriage relation has legitimately been dissolved in God's eyes. In such a situation both the divorced husband and the divorced wife are free to remarry, regardless of who committed adultery. The same logic applies to Matt 19:9.</p>
<p>
In 1 Cor 7 Paul says: <font color= "blue">"But if the unbeliever departs, let him depart; a brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases." (1 Cor 7:15)</font><br> In this verse "departs" means wilfully deserts—abandons, and "not under bondage" means the partner who is left no longer is legally obligated to the marriage contract. Thus God sanctions divorce in cases where an unbelieving partner leaves the believer. And in these cases, Paul does not prohibit the unbeliever who has left or the believer who has been left from remarrying. <br>And what God does not prohibit, he permits.</p>
<p>
Additionally, the sharp contrast between 1 Cor 7:12, where no divorce is allowed, and 1 Cor 7:15 strongly suggests that in the case of desertion, the believing partner is free to remarry.</p>
<p>
Finally, in 1 Cor 7 Paul says: <font color= "blue">"Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? Do not seek a wife. But even if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned"<br> (1 Cor 7:27-28)</font> Paul's guiding principle in this section (1 Cor 7:25-28) is stated in:<font color= "blue">"because of the present distress—that it is good for a man to remain as he is:" (1 Cor 7:26)</font> In other words, because of the situation Christians in Corinth were facing, Paul thought it best for them not to make any life-altering changes in their marriage relationships (see the second paragraph in this section for more detail). What Paul is encouraging, not commanding, is that if you are married, do not seek to be "loosed", that is, divorced.</p>
<p>
Conversely, he says if you are "loosed", that is, divorced, don't seek to be married. <font color= "blue">But even if you do marry, you have not sinned;" (1 Cor 7:28)</font> <br>In other words, if you choose not to follow his suggestions, you have not sinned. The "you" in this verse (1 Cor 7:28) clearly refers to divorced people.<br> Paul is saying divorced people can remarry, presumably if they meet the biblical requirements for having a legitimate divorce (see above).</p>
<h3>
Some Conclusions
</h3>
<p>
(1) Death dissolves the marriage contract and leaves the remaining partner free to remarry.</p>
<p>
(2) Sexual immorality by one partner gives the other partner a legal right, but not an obligation, in God's eyes to divorce the unfaithful partner. Both partners then are free to remarry.</p>
<p>
(3) If an unbelieving marriage partner deserts the believing partner and refuses to be reconciled, the believing partner is free to divorce.<br> Then both partners are free to remarry.</p>
<p>
(4) All Christians who have been properly divorced, that is, for one of the two biblical reasons, are free to remarry. </p>
<p>
(5) Something we have not discussed in this note but that nevertheless should be stated is that Christians are only to marry other Christians. <br>A Christian is not to marry a non-Christian. 1 Cor 7:39; cf. 2 Cor 6:14ff.</p>
<p>
(6) God values love, mercy, and forgiveness in us far above the dissolution of relationships, especially marriage, and the legalistic exacting of punishment:</p>
<p>
A. 1 Cor 13: <font color= "blue">"Love suffers long and is kind; love does not envy; love does not parade itself, is not puffed up; does not behave rudely, does not seek its own, is not provoked, thinks no evil; does not rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth; bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. <br>(1 Cor 13:4-7</font>)</p>
<p>
B. Matt 9: <font color= "blue">"But go and learn what this means: "I desire mercy, and not sacrifice". For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance." (Matt 9:13)</font></p>
<p>
C. Matt 18: <font color= "blue">"Then Peter came to Him and said, “Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?” Jesus said to him, “I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven." (Matt 18:21-22)</font></p>
<p>
D. James 2: <font color= "blue">"So speak and so do as those who will be judged by the law of liberty. 13 For judgement is without mercy to the one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgement." (James 2:12-13)</font> </p>
<p>
E. Prov 19: <font color= "blue">"The discretion of a man makes him slow to anger, and his glory is to overlook a transgression" (Prov 19:11)</font></p>
<p>
F. 1 Peter 4: "<font color= "blue">And above all things have fervent love for one another, for “love will cover a multitude of sins." (1 Peter 4:8)</font></p>
<p>
G. Col 3: <font color= "blue">"Therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, put on tender mercies, kindness, humility, meekness, long suffering; 13 bearing with one another, and forgiving one another, if anyone has a complaint against another; even as Christ forgave you, so you also must do. 14 But above all these things put on love, which is the bond of perfection." (Col 3:12-14)</font>
