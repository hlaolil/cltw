Saving Zacchaeus 
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Then Jesus entered and passed through Jericho." (Luke 19:1)</font>
Jesus had no plans to stay in Jericho. But it lies on the way to His final destination -- Jerusalem. </p>
<h3>
Zacchaeus, the Wealthy Tax Collector 
</h3>
<p>
Luke, the storyteller, first introduces the chief character, Zacchaeus, and then goes back to Jesus who is entering the city. This quick shift of scenes helps the reader get acquainted with Zacchaeus so that the full significance of the story is appreciated at its climax.</p>
<p>
"there was a man named Zacchaeus who was a chief tax collector, and he was rich. And he sought to see who Jesus was, but could not because of the crowd, for he was of short stature. So he ran ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see Him, for He was going to pass that way." (Luke 19:2-4)</font>
We meet a small man, too short to see over the crowd. His name is Zacchaeus, an abbreviation of Zechariah, meaning "the righteous one" -- a big name to live up to.</p>
<p>
The name was incongruous for Zacchaeus, since he was the chief tax collector in Jericho, and tax collectors were notorious for cheating the general public to fatten their pockets. They would assess a tax, and if the person refused to pay or called it unfair, Herod's soldiers would threaten him. Regions of a kingdom would be divided up into districts, and a tax collector would become responsible for collecting a certain amount of tax and passing it up the chain to the government. Whatever he collected over the amount required was his to keep. A chief tax collector would employ tax collectors under him to collect taxes in various parts of the district.</p>
<p>
As chief tax collector, Zacchaeus was probably was responsible for collecting tolls on goods coming into Judea from Perea, a main trade route. This business had made him rich. The word for "wealthy" is Greek plousios, "pertaining to having an abundance of earthly possessions that exceeds normal experience, rich, wealthy." But despite his riches, or perhaps because of them, Zacchaeus was hated by the people. They saw him as a crook and a traitor, who worked as a spy for the Roman oppressors in order to take their money and give it to the occupation government, and on to Rome.</p>
<p>
Zacchaeus was short, wealthy, and hated. But he was also curious. He heared that Jesus was coming through town and was determined to see Him. One evidence of his earnestness and purpose is the fact that he ran ahead to where he knew Jesus would pass. He found a large tree, and therein established a reconnaissance outpost where he would be able to see Jesus without attracting unwanted attention. The sycamore-fig tree (Ficus sycomorus) is a robust evergreen tree that grows to about 12 meters high, with branches spreading in every direction. Their many branches make them easy to climb. It was springtime, and new leaves had appeared among the old foliage on the tree. Zacchaeus was ready.</p>
<h3>
Jesus Invites Himself to Dinner 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"And when Jesus came to the place, He looked up and saw him, and said to him, “Zacchaeus, make haste and come down, for today I must stay at your house.” So he made haste and came down, and received Him joyfully" (Luke 19:5-6)</font>
I am always fascinated when I read this. Jesus is walking along, mobbed by townspeople. But all of a sudden He looks up and sees Zacchaeus in the tree above Him and stops. Does He know he'll find Zacchaeus in the tree that day? We don't know. It wouldn't surprise me. And more remarkable, He calls Zacchaeus by name. Does He know Zacchaeus' name ahead of time, or does He pick it up from angry whispers in the crowd about the man Jesus was peering up at.</p>
<p>
He called out to Zacchaeus by name: "Zacchaeus, come down immediately. I must stay at your house today." 
Jesus says He "must" come to dinner! Now! Immediately! We might think of this as presumptuous and rude. But Zacchaeus is overjoyed. Here he was, a social outcast being offered the opportunity to host one of the most famous men in the country. Of course, he is happy. He scrambles down the tree and welcomes Jesus. </p>
<p>
Jesus isn't the first prophet to be sent by God to an individual who would feed him. God tells Elijah the Prophet:
<font color= "blue">“Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and dwell there. See, I have commanded a widow there to provide for you.” So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, indeed a widow was there gathering sticks. And he called to her and said, “Please bring me a little water in a cup, that I may drink.” And as she was going to get it, he called to her and said, “Please bring me a morsel of bread in your hand.”" (1 Kings 17:9-11)</font></p>
<p>
Jesus has invited himself for dinner at this man's home. Out of hunger? No. But because he knows something about the desire and earnestness in this man's heart. Jesus can see that he is wealthy. His clothes betray that easily. Be he can also see the man's longing and his faith. Jesus has spiritual sight.</p>
<p>
And I believe that is what Jesus had that day in Jericho; it accounts for him inviting himself to Zacchaeus' home for dinner. Elijah's presence was instrumental in feeding the destitute widow and her son. Jesus' presence was responsible for providing salvation and forgiveness to a wealthy man who is starving for spiritual life.</p>
<h3>
Guest of a Sinner 
</h3>
<p>
But Jesus' choice of dinner companions didn't make him popular in Jericho.

"But when they saw it, they all complained, saying, “He has gone to be a guest with a man who is a sinner.” (Luke 19:7)</font>
Aren't you glad that Jesus loves you whether or not others approve? Perhaps the people are jealous that the honor of Jesus' presence goes to such an unworthy citizen. And perhaps they think less of Jesus for associating with people like Zacchaeus</p>
<h3>
Zacchaeus Repents (19:8)
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Then Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord, I give half of my goods to the poor; and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore fourfold.” (Luke 19:8)</font>
Look at Zacchaeus' reaction to the criticism and shame he is bringing on his guest. First, he stands up, indicating probably that he had fallen to his knees before Jesus. Next, he offers to give half his possessions to the poor. The rich young ruler (who evidently was richer than Zacchaeus) has trouble disposing of his wealth, but not Zacchaeus. In one stroke he pledges half his possessions to help the poor. 50% of one's possessions goes far beyond the 20% that might be considered generous by the rabbis. Here is a fledgling disciple who does not love money, but has his priorities in the right place.</p>
<p>
Finally, he offers restitution to any he has wronged -- four times the amount he cheated them. Our English translation "if I have cheated anybody" might indicate that Zacchaeus isn't taking responsibility for cheating, and making it only hypothetical. This conditional clause doesn't put in doubt the fact of the extortion, only its extent. Marshall translates it, "From whomsoever I have wrongfully exacted anything ..."</p>
<p>
It is wonderfully refreshing to see such repentance by a man who realises that his life must change or it will bring discredit upon his guest. These days it is common to see people wearing a cross -- the symbol of Jesus' death for our sins -- and be involved with all kinds of sin and degradation. 
<br>King David, who committed adultery, murder, and deceit, was heartbroken when the Prophet Nathan reminded him, "<font color= "blue">because by this deed you have given great occasion to the enemies of the Lord to blaspheme, the child also who is born to you shall surely die.” ..." (2 Sam 12:14)</font>. It is so vital to repentance that we recognise, as David did, that "Against You, and You only, have I sinned and done this evil in Your sight" (Psa 51:4). Our sins against others discredit the God with whom we identify ourselves, and we owe Him a huge apology.</p>
<p>
Zacchaeus' acts of repentance were both genuine and required if he was to remove from Jesus the shame of associating with him. Isn't it wonderful that Jesus takes our shame upon Himself willingly, waiting, hoping that we will understand and repent. What grace! What mercy! Love changes people. Jesus' love changes us. Our love for others can bring change to them.</p>
<h3>
Son of Abraham 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"And Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham;" (Luke 19:9)</font>
Now Jesus moves to reconcile Zacchaeus with the townspeople who despise Him. They view tax collectors as worse than infidels, banish them from their synagogues, and disown them as Jews. But Jesus insists that Zacchaeus has received salvation. His actions evidence repentance, a change of heart. And Jesus reaffirms that Zacchaeus is indeed a Jew, a son of Abraham. He calls on the man's neighbours to welcome and accept him.</p>
<h3>
Seeking the Lost 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"For the Son of Man came to seek and to save that which was lost." (Luke 19:10)</font>
The final passage of this section of Luke's Gospel contains Jesus' mission -- that of a Shepherd, to seek and to rescue the lost and straying. It is a servant's role. There is little glorious about this kind of work. It may look spectacular in mass meetings where the converted stream from the stadium seating to a place of repentance on the infield, but it involves working with slimy people who have committed grievous sins and whose lives are both miserable and misery-filled.

Those people are in our churches, in our neighborhoods, at our jobs, in our schools -- hurting people whose lives are messed up and who need Jesus' mercy and grace. These people need our willingness to love them rather than judge them, our willingness to go out of our way to extend ourselves in love.</p>
<h3>
Lessons for Disciples
</h3>
<p>
I see a number of lessons in this story for modern-day disciples:

No one is beyond redemption and repentance, even those whom we see as gross sinners. They are all susceptible to sensing Jesus' love for them.
Love changes people. Acceptance and openness which were Jesus' modus operendi and must become ours, too.
We disciples must not be overly concerned about tarnishing our reputation. Yes, we are to be wise and discrete and avoid the appearance of evil. But we must not be more concerned about ourselves than we are for the lost. We need to be willing to take the shame of their sin upon us, as it were, so that we might bring Jesus' love to them.
Our Master's mission is active, not passive. He doesn't wait for people to come to him. He actively seeks the lost in order to save them.
God can give us both natural and supernatural insights into people so that we might help them.
Our ministry to others may require a boldness, an edginess that calls on us to invite ourselves for dinner if that is what is required.
Disciples of Jesus are no longer enamoured with money, but with Jesus and his righteousness.
Perhaps you can see some more lessons. In this story I see Jesus as the Great Shepherd, relentlessly seeking and relentlessly saving one lost person after another. And you and I are his assistants, his disciples, his co-workers. His mission is our mission. His clients are our clients. His sorrows, our sorrows. And the joy in Jesus eyes as he watches an enthusiastic, short sinner, scramble down from a tree and be changed in an instant into a saint -- that joy, too, is ours to share.</p>
<h3>
Prayer
</h3>
<p>
Jesus, as I read about Zacchaeus, I think of my own selfishness. Sometimes I am impatient with people, despairing of people for whom you died. Forgive me for my lack of vision. Help me to see you at work in people around me. Help me to be willing to risk whatever reputation I have to join in your search and rescue campaign. I long to see your salvation shine more brightly through me. In your holy name, I pray. Amen.</p>
