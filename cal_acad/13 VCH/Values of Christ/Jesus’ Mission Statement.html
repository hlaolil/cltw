Jesus’ Mission Statement
</h1>	
<h3>
Nazareth
</h3>
<p>
We find Jesus’ Mission Statement in the first message He preached in 

Nazareth when He said,<font color= "blue"> “The Spirit of the Lord 

God is upon Me, because the Lord has anointed Me to preach good 

tidings to the poor;
He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the 

captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound;
To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord"<br> (Isa 61:1-2)
</font></p>
<p>
(In his excellent work, The Life And Times Of Jesus The Messiah, 

Alfred Edersheim makes a strong case that the year Jesus began His 

public ministry was the Year of Jubilee, a year of celebration and 

liberation when all debts were cancelled, all slaves set free. If 

this be the case, Jesus’ message would be especially fitting, for He 

was about to set people free from religious domination as well.)</p>
<p>
When Jesus read from the Book of Isaiah the prophecy concerning 

Himself, there were 613 commandments which the Pharisees had 

determined were embedded in the Scriptures. Consequently, those who 

heard His words struggled under a heavy burden of what they were 

told constituted true religion and holiness. No wonder, then, that 

they marvelled at the gracious words Jesus spoke to them (Luke 

4:22).</p>
<p>
But as He continued speaking to them of their need for Him, their 

marvel turned to wrath. ‘How dare He give a word of correction to 

us?’ they asked. ‘We know Him. He grew up here. This is just 

Joseph’s boy.’ Jesus caught these people off guard because quite 

possibly there were boys in the town who were much better candidates 

to be Messiah than He. After all, the other boys wore phylacteries — 

boxes worn on the forehead or around their wrists which contained 

Deut 6:8. Jesus, evidently, never did (Matt 23:5).</p>
<p>
Jesus, however, modelled something entirely different. As they 

watched Him grow up, the people in His home town didn’t say of Him, 

‘Now there’s a spiritual young man.’ No, they wanted to kill Him 

(Luke 4:29). You wouldn’t want to kill a man you thought was 

qualified to be Messiah.</p>
<h3>
Jesus travelled light
</h3>
<p>
Not only did Jesus not carry a Bible, but He evidently never gave a 

formal Bible study to His disciples.<br> That’s what the Pharisees 

did. Endlessly. They unrolled the scrolls. They had discussions. 

They prodded and pontificated. But although Jesus knew the Word 

better than all of them by the age of 12 (Luke 2:47), His approach 

to spiritual life and Bible study was entirely different.</p>
<p>
And because Jesus was able to move about without a big Bible in 

hand, impressing people with His knowledge, He was able to do 

incarnational ministry which was completely non-intimidating — as 

when He would derive a succinct lesson on spiritual life simply from 

seeing a man casting seed into a field <br>(Luke 8:5).</p>
<p>
Jesus was succinct, when Thomas was 

doubting, Jesus didn’t say, "Let Me give you five reasons why the 

Resurrection is true, fifteen Old Testament prophecies which shed 

light on what is happening before you". No, He simply said, <font color= "blue">"Touch 

My wounds," (John 20:27)</font>.</p>
<p>
It’s not that He didn’t know the prophecies. It’s not that He didn’t 

have a grasp on Scripture. But it’s as though He had distilled them 

to the point where the people He cared about could be effectively 

reached without being intimidated by His knowledge. His was an 

incarnational ministry which amazes me.<br>

Jesus did this on one occasion though — on the road To Emmaus.<BR> This is the only time such teaching is recorded, it was the 

singular exception rather than the rule — and even then, it was 

given to two individuals who were outside of His inner circle of 12.<br>

Not only do we find an absence of recorded Bible study in the Word, 

but there is not one recorded instance in the New Testament where 

Jesus prayed with His disciples, not one time where He said to His disciples "Let’s talk to the Father together."</p>
<h3>
Jesus and prayer
</h3>
<p>
Finally, after a year and a half, His disciples said, "Lord teach us 

to pray. John does. The Pharisees do." Indeed the Pharisees did pray 

in the open lot, on the street corner, in the marketplace, they 

loved to give long prayers. </p>
<p>
But what did Jesus do? In response to His disciple's request to 

teach them to pray, He not only repeated the simple prayer He had 

taught them a year and a half earlier in the Sermon on the Mount, 

but He shortened it by five words.

Jesus’ disciples knew prayer was the foundation of His ministry. 

Seeing Him slip away before the break of day morning by morning (Isa 

50), they knew He was a man of passionate prayer. And yet He didn’t 

necessarily pray with them.<br> Even in the Garden of Gethsemane, He 

said, <font color= "blue"> “Sit here while I go and pray over there.” (Matt 26:36)</font>.</p>
<p>
Why? I suggest it was because, although prayer is a glorious 

privilege, it can also be very intimidating to people. <br>Jesus reversed the 

entire order. He talked about a prayer closet, about praying in 

secret, as if to say, "Forget the outward expression because it 

intimidates people. They’re burdened by your seeming spirituality, 

but I came to set them free."</p>
<p>
As a result, common people heard Him gladly (Mark 12:37). They were 

drawn to Him like moths to a flame not because He was well groomed 

or well-attired <br>(Isa 53:2), but because there was evidently 

something in His eyes which welcomed them, something in His voice 

which warmed them. <br>The Pharisees were 

the best-dressed men of their day, they came across as very polished 

and sophisticated. But they also came across as stern and 

unapproachable.</p>
<h3>
Jesus made wine
</h3>
<p>
Not Jesus. So easy was He to be with that for His inaugural miracle, 

He made wine for a wedding party. History tells us that in Jesus’ 

day, when a baby girl was born into the family, her father would 

annually make a batch of wine for himself and one for his daughter’s 

marriage celebration. Therefore, if the bride at Cana was fifteen or 

sixteen, there would have been presented to the happy couple 16 

years worth of wine. But after drinking all 16 years worth, the 

wedding party in Cana ran out of wine.<br>

So what did Jesus do? Did He give them a lecture on the danger of 

overindulgence? Did He make a bottle or two? No, 

instead, He made 180 gallons (John 2:6) saying, "Here’s a little bride and groom who are 

embarrassed. I want to help them." He gave no teaching; He got no 

glory. He simply provided wine with no strings attached.<br> In fact, in 

studying His miracles, very rarely do we see Jesus make application 

to the people He touched or healed or helped. With the exception of 

a couple of occasions, no tract was given out, no teaching given.</p>
<h3>
The rich young ruler
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Jesus said to him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.” <br>

(Matt 19:21)</font>. But when he couldn’t do this, Jesus simply let His invitation stand.

I’m intrigued by the Reformers. Reformers are intense, single-

minded, committed. Yet the fire in their eyes, and the determination 

on their faces can cause people to be intimidated, to back away, to 

feel bad. Reformers can be uptight. Not Jesus. Why? He trusted the 

Father, that in due time the rich young ruler would see the truth of 

His words, the depth of His love and come back.</p>
<h3>
Jesus cleared the Temple
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
 When He had made a whip of cords, He drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen, and poured out the changer's money and overturned the tables. And He said to those who sold doves, “Take these things away! Do not make My Father’s house a house of merchandise!” (John 2:15-16)</font>. <br>

Jesus cared about one thing: His Father’s will.

That’s all. That is how He was able to move around with serenity, 

focus, and a complete lack of busyness.<br><font color= "blue"> My yoke is easy and My burden is light.” (Matt 11:30)</font>. And He lived this out in such 

a way that no one ever once suggested or implied He was busy.</p>
<h3>
Jesus kept company with sinners to Pharisees
</h3>
<p>
Jesus truly breaks the mould of what we perceive holiness and 

spirituality to be. Although we think this is seen in the fact that 

He hung around publicans and sinners, I believe it is seen more 

clearly in the fact that He dined with Pharisees. To be sure, He 

spoke harshly to the Pharisees because He knew that’s what it would 

take to get through to those about whom He genuinely cared. <br>But when 

they invited Him to their gatherings, He went.

You see, at the home of Simon, Jesus ministered to the Pharisee and 

prostitute alike (Luke 7:36-39).<br> 

Jesus was completely not interested in who you were. Pharisee, prostitute, 

woman, man, old, young — He loved anyone and everyone the Father 

sent His way.</p>
<h3>
Jesus on love and the law
</h3>
<p>Jesus' were disciples picking wheat on the Sabbath Day
<font color= "blue">And when the Pharisees saw it, they said to Him, “Look, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!”
But He said to them, “Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, he and those who were with him: how he entered the house of God and ate the show bread which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests? (Matt 12:2-4)</font><br>
Jesus asked this question, as if to say: <br>"There are laws and there is love. But 

when love and the law collide, love always has precedence."
There’s something a whole lot more important than rules. <br>

It’s people.</p>
<h3>
The woman at the well
</h3>
<p>
Jesus dealt with the woman at the well without ever directly dealing 

with the issue of her living with a man who was not her husband. <br>But in 

recording the story, the Holy Spirit seems to say to any who 

question this, "That’s none of your business. You don’t need to know 

whether Jesus dealt directly with that issue or not."

Could this be because, knowing this woman had had five husbands and 

was living with a man to whom she was not married, she would have 

obviously been branded as an immoral woman whose only option to 

survive financially was through prostitution? <br>Could it be that Jesus 

was saying, "What the religious are concerned about, I’m not all 

that concerned about and what the religious aren’t concerned about, 

namely love, concerns me to the utmost?<br>

"I am anointed to preach the gospel to the poor, to heal the 

broken hearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, to give sight 

to the blind, and to set at liberty those who are bruised," <br>Jesus 

said this in the most magnificent Mission Statement ever conceived.<br> And 

He fulfilled it perfectly, exquisitely, completely.</p>
<p>
Jesus blows apart every idea we have about spirituality and ministry 

and in so doing He sets us all free from the burdens and baggage of 

grumpiness and condemnation, of fear and intimidation.<br>

Revisit Jesus — this laid-back Lover of people Whose intensity was 

private and personal, Who didn’t put pressure on people.

Re-acquaint yourself with the Friend of sinners, the Man Who spoke 

gracious words continually, Who healed unconditionally, Who loved 

sacrificially — for although He is unrecognised by most religious 

people, He alone defines true holiness.
