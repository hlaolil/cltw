The Peacemakers <br>Seventh Beatitude
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God. (Matt 5:9)</font> </p>
 <p>
Christ blesses not peace, but peacemakers. Peacemakers are not pacifists. Peacemakers are warriors, but they are spiritual warriors, warriors against war. Sometimes war can be conquered only by war. Everyone speaks highly of peacemaking. How, then, is that counter cultural, except to terrorists?<br> Because the peace that Christ blesses is the peace the world cannot give.<br> It is peace with neighbour, self, and God; not with the world, the flesh, and the devil. It not a peace with greed, lust, and pride, but the peace that comes through poverty, chastity, and obedience, three most counter cultural virtues. <br>These two kinds of peace are in fact at war with each other.</p>
<p>
Our world's peacemakers will embrace Christ's peace, but only if they do not have to give up the world's peace and only if they do not have to fight for it. Thus, paradoxically, we lack true peace because we are reluctant to war against the enemies of peace, and also because we do not put the three ingredients of Christ's peace in the proper order. We preach incessantly about peace with neighbour, but seldom about peace with God.<br> Thomas Merton reminds us of this necessary order in three wonderfully simple sentences when he says, "We are not at peace with each other because we are not at peace with ourselves, and we are not at peace with ourselves because we are not at peace with God." Christ does the same in putting the first table of the law first, as Moses did. We need to relearn lesson one.</p>
<p>
Christ blesses peacemakers, but when you are at war, you can make peace only by waging and winning war. Christianity is judgemental and repressive and negative. For Christianity says to us that we are at war, ever since a certain incident in Eden, and war judges the enemy (that's why a war is fought: because a judgement is made about an enemy) and represses the enemy <br>(that is what defence is: repressing the enemy's offence) and negates the enemy, destroys the enemy (that is what offence is, destroying the enemy's defence).<br> Our enemies are real, just as real as flesh and blood; they are principalities and powers. They are not men; they are demons. And they are also our own sins.</p>
<p>
Our Lord told us that He came into the world to bring a sword to wage and win this war. The sword is a cross. Happiness does not consist in pacifism; happiness consists in peace, and peace can be obtained only by waging and winning a war to make peace. The cross is like a syringe; it gives us a blood transfusion.<br> It is the opposite of a normal sword. What Christ does is exactly the opposite of what Dracula does. Dracula, like the demons, takes our blood, our life. <br>Christ gives us a blood transfusion. We are on a battlefield between Christ and Dracula.<p>
<p>
When Christ says that peacemakers are blessed because they "will be called the sons of God," He does not mean that peacemaking is the cause and being a son of God is the effect. The other way around: only the sons of God can make God's peace, do God's work. Peacemaking is the effect. But peacemakers are called sons of God. They are known to be sons of God because we recognise the cause by the effect.<p><img src="../../../images/content/Adobe-Photoshop-Old-icon.png" width="30" height="30" hspace="25" vspace="0" border="0" align="right"alt="> </p>
