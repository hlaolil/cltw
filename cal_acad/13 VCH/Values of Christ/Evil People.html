   <h1>
Evil People
</h1>
<p>
The Sermon on the Mount is part of what's can be called “The Jesus Curriculum”, the things that Jesus wanted us His followers to know.</p>
<p>
First Jesus talked about the character of the people who are in the kingdom. Then He talked about the code of the kingdom: the way Jesus wants His followers to be.
He tells us that our righteousness must be genuine—not just external actions, but internal attitudes. In Jesus’ day, (not like The Pharisees)
But Jesus wants both our external actions and our internal attitudes to match His character.</p>
<p>
For example, everyone agrees that murder is wrong. That’s obvious. <br>But murder is merely the external evidence of an internal attitude.<br>
Jesus said that it is also wrong to harbour unresolved anger in your heart—whether or not it leads to murder.</p>
<p>
Likewise, nearly everyone recognises that adultery is wrong.
But Jesus says that it’s also wrong to nurture sexual desire in your heart for someone other than your spouse.</p>
<p>
God permits divorce because when a marriage has failed, it’s wrong to just abandon your spouse and leave them unable to remarry.
But Jesus says that it’s wrong to capriciously divorce your spouse just because you’re tired of being married to him or her.</p>
<p>
Lastly, we saw that it’s wrong to go back on your word.
But Jesus says that the important thing is to be a truthful person, inside and out.</p>
<h3>
Sweet Revenge
</h3>
<p>
As we turn to this passage in Matt 5:38, we find that the next few verses are about justice and revenge. God has given us some legitimate avenues for justice here on earth, but Jesus warns us that personal revenge is something completely different. Revenge may taste sweet, but it’s wrong.</p>
<p>
As as John Milton wrote in Paradise Lost:<br>
<i>Revenge, at first though sweet, bitter ere long back on itself recoils.</i></p>
<p>
This passage is a very confusing one that has often been misunderstood in several different ways. It’s led to all kinds of sloppy thinking about what kind of a person Jesus was and what He taught.
This passage is also the source of four very well-known sayings that almost everyone has heard or used before, but not everyone understands:</p>
<p>
An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.</p>
<p>
whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.</p>
<p>
Go the second mile.</p>
<p>
Give him the shirt off your back, let him have your cloak also</p>
<p>
So let’s take a look at what Jesus teaches about revenge:</p>
<p>
<font color= "blue">"You have heard that it was said, "An eye for eye, and a tooth for a tooth."<br> (Matt 5:38)</font></p>
<p>
Anti = instead of (same word used of Jesus dying instead of us)
A replacement.</p>
<p>
This was meant to restrain revenge, to make sure that the punishment did not exceed the crime. There was room for grace and alternative punishments.<br> But this kept people from going too far in their punishments.<br>
When someone hurts us ... our natural tendency is payback.
We want them to hurt like we were hurt. We talk about getting even, and settling the score.<br>The idea is that because they hurt us we now owe them some hurt in return. And that’s one debt we’re only too glad to settle. In fact, usually it’s not enough to “get even”. We usually want to add just a little more.<br> Like playing poker: I see your insult and I raise you a poke in the eye!</p>
<p>
This policy, written into the OT, was actually designed to prevent personal vendettas from inflicting a harsher punishment than the criminal deserved.<br> If somebody blinded someone, they shouldn’t be killed for it. They should be held accountable for only an eye. Many times these debts were paid with a cash settlement—whatever amount an eye or a tooth was worth.<br> The Bible supports measured justice.</p>
<p>
But even if we stay within the bounds of inflicting reciprocal pain, we’re still missing the point. Because our external conformity to the demands of justice is often masking an internal problem: we want revenge.<br>And revenge is sin. So Jesus says,
"You have heard that it was said, An eye for eye, and a tooth for a tooth."  But I tell you, Do not resist an evil person.<br>(Matt 5:38-39)</p>
<p>
When we are hurt, we want payback.

But Jesus says, “Don’t fight back.”<br>

The word “resist” means “to oppose, set one’s self against”

Stand plus Anti. <br>“To be hostile towards”<br>

The idea is not so much about non-resistance as it is about not facing off.<br>

This is not pacifism (a refusal to meet evil with violence or war).<br>

There seems to be plenty of room in the Bible for self-defence.

But this is clearly not aggressive, either.<br>

This verse is a specific warning not to take personal retribution.

Don’t escalate the situation by “getting even”.

Rather, de-escalate. Diffuse. Lower the stakes.

Pacify. Endure. Forgive.<br>

This is not a natural response.</p>
<p>
—Nikita Khrushchev, Soviet statesman, wrote in 1971

“We had no use for the policy of the Gospels: if someone slaps you, just turn the other cheek. We had shown that anyone who slapped us on our cheek would get his head kicked off.”</p>
<p>
Jesus calls us to respond counter-intuitively. Instead of meeting evil with equal or greater force, He urges us to meet evil with a completely different force: with good. Instead of paying back in kind, we are called to pay back with kindness.

There’s a parallel passage in Rom 12 that explains how this works.
<p><font color= "blue">
Repay no one evil for evil. Have regard for good things in the sight of all men. If it is possible, as much as depends on you, live peaceably with all men. Beloved, do not avenge yourselves, but rather give place to wrath; for it is written, “Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,” says the Lord. Therefore
“if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in so doing you will heap coals of fire on his head.” Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.(Rom 12:17-21)</font></p>
<p>
Don’t do evil just because someone did evil to you.

They did the wrong thing. You do the right thing.

Doesn’t that sound like something you tell your kids?<br>

The younger one hits the older one. So the older one hits them back.<br>

Then the younger one complains to mom and dad.

“Mom, Jimmy hit me.”<br>

Mom says, “Jimmy, did you hit your little sister?”

“Yes.”

“Why would you do such a thing?”

“Because she hit me first.”<br>

And she wants so badly for them to get it. Don't retaliate!<br>

“Look, you take care of you and I’ll take care of your little sister. Believe me, you’ve got your hands full taking care of you. You just concentrate on making sure that you’re doing the right thing and don’t worry about what your sister is doing. I’ll take care of her.”</p>
<p>

That’s exactly what God is trying to say to us. Don’t get involved in the business of trying to get even—making sure everybody gets what they deserve.<br> That’s God’s job and He’s really good at it. Instead, we’re supposed to try to get along as much as possible.</p>
<p>
(Rom 12:18) If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with all men.</p>
<p>
It may not be possible, but we should do whatever we can on our side.<br>

But if we do that, if no one stands up to the aggressor, if we don’t give him what he deserves, then he’s just going to keep on doing it! If he gets away with it this time, he’s just doing to do it to someone else. Where does that leave justice?

God has an answer for you:</p>
<p>
(Rom 12:19) Do not take revenge, my friends, but leave room for God's wrath, for it is written: "“Vengeance is Mine, I will repay," says the Lord.</p>
<p>
God will take care of justice. It may not be when we want it. It may not be how we want it. But He will make sure that justice is done.<br>

This policy is not a lack of justice. It is a call not to take personal revenge in order to get justice. Leave justice and revenge to God.<br>

Some of that justice we won’t see until we get to heaven. But some of that is going to happen here on earth. In fact, God has a special agent he uses for that very purpose.<br> No, it’s not me ... or you. It’s the French. That is, it’s the French government ... and the American government and the South African government and the Iraqi government. The Bible says that God uses government to bring a measure of justice to the world. It’s not perfect justice and it’s not enough. <br>But while we’re waiting for the perfect justice of the Kingdom, the governments of the world at least hold back evil and bring some modicum of justice to the world. They are God’s justice agents, God’s instruments.
<p><font color= "blue">
For he is God’s minister to you for good. But if you do evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God’s minister, an avenger to execute wrath on him who practices evil. (Rom 13:4)</font></p>
<p>
The sword = the power of execution and waging war.</p>
<p>
A legitimate, biblical function of government is to punish those who do wrong. And when they do, they function as God’s agents to punish evil. That is part of how God administers justice. It’s not perfect. But one day, God’s going to fix all that, too, and there will be perfect justice. So in the meantime, we’re supposed to keep out of it and let God do His thing. We’ve got a different job to do.<br> Paul goes on in Rom 12:</p>
<p>
Do not take revenge ... On the contrary:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">"If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink. For in so doing, you will heap coals of fire on his head." (Rom 12:20)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good. (Rom 12:21)</font></p>
<p>
We are to answer evil with good. The trap is to be overcome by evil, to be so hurt, so wounded that we too choose an evil path by personally trying to settle the score. But God says, try paying back evil with good. What happens is even more devastating to the person who hurt you.</p>
<p>
Everybody understands tit for tat. That’s the way the world works.<br> But they have a really hard time with paying back evil with good.<br> It makes their conscience burn. It drives them to rethink their approach because it’s not producing what they expected. That’s the way to overcome evil.<br> Not by fighting it. Not by punishing it. Not by stamping it out.<br> But by smothering it with kindness and generosity until it can no longer breathe.</p>
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
Jesus says, I know that justice is important to you. I know that it hurts when you’ve been wronged. But be careful. There’s a danger here.<br> Never let your thirst for justice turn into a quest for revenge. Don’t get even. You’ve been attacked and cheated and forced and taken advantage of. <br>But answer the evil with kindness and generosity. And then leave everything else to God.</p
