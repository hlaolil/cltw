   <h1>
Are You Good Enough
</h1>
<p>
You’ve probably heard this question before:<br> If you were to die tonight and stand before God and He said to you, “Why should I let you into heaven?” What would you say to Him?<br>

When I ask people that question, a large part of the time the answer I hear back is, “I would tell Him that I think I’ve lived a pretty good life. Hopefully the good I’ve done will outweigh whatever bad I’ve done.”<br>

Maybe some of you feel the same way. Here’s the problem: Just how good is good enough? How good do you need to be to get into heaven?<br>

What exactly is the cut off point?<br>

It is not just a question that we ask today. It was also a question that people in Jesus’ day were very interested in. Knowing that, He answered it very clearly so we’re going to look at His answer.
<h3>
The Jesus Curriculum
</h3>
<p>
The Sermon on the Mount, a lesson that Jesus taught to His followers. It’s a kind of handbook for the Kingdom of God. </p>
<h3>
The Kingdom Code
</h3>
<p>
Jesus said to His followers they should let the world see their goodness and that will have a profound effect on the people of the world. Next, Jesus goes on to describe what goodness looks like.<br> Exactly what did Jesus mean? What kind of goodness was He looking for? <br>And exactly how good was good enough?
<p><font size="+1">
The code is still in place</font></p>
<p>
Jesus begins by saying that He’s not starting all over from a blank slate.<br>
<font color= "blue">
“Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to destroy but to fulfil". (Matt 5:17)</font><br>

“Law and Prophets” was typical way of referring to the Scriptures, what we call “The Old Testament”. 

Jesus is trying to head off any misunderstanding.

Someone might think that if the spiritually bankrupt belong to the kingdom of God, then Jesus must be saying that it doesn’t matter if you’re good—that it doesn’t matter if you obey the law.<br>

But Jesus is saying, “I am not doing away with it, I am fulfilling it.”

It means that the OT points to Him and by His life, His teachings, His death, His resurrection, and His return He completes the OT—He makes it happen, He brings it into reality. Jesus is not setting it aside and starting over with something different. He’s finishing the incomplete masterpiece that was begun in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>
Several things in the Old Testament are radically changed by the coming of Jesus Christ. In the completed masterpiece, there are temporary measures that are no longer needed, like sacrifices. But that is like removing the scaffolding. <br>It is far different than erasing the masterpiece.<br>
<font color= "blue">
For assuredly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, one jot or one tittle will by no means pass from the law till all is fulfilled, (Matt 5:18)</font><br>

Not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.
Basically, He’s saying that no part of the Old Testament, no matter how small, no part can be set aside without being fulfilled, as it is being fulfilled right now in the life and teachings of Christ.<br>
Since that is true, it is important that we keep to the code.
<p><font size="+1">
The code is to be practised and taught</font></p>
<p>
<font color= "blue">
Whoever therefore breaks one of the least of these commandments, and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does and teaches them, he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. (Matt 5:19)</font>
<p><font size="+1">
The code requires perfection</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven. (Matt 5:20)</font><br>

The Pharisees were theological conservatives. They believed God. They believed His word. They wanted to live lives that demonstrated their devotion to God. So they were very careful about their behaviour. They went to great extremes to make sure they were not disobeying God’s law. To the people of the day, there was no one more righteous than the Pharisees. But Jesus says, “If you aren’t better than them—the most righteous people you know—then you will certainly not enter the kingdom of heaven.</p>
<p>
In essence what that means is that no one is good enough to enter the Kingdom of heaven. How good is good enough? Perfect. 100%. Better than you are. More righteousness than you have. Even the most righteous people are not qualified to enter the kingdom.

If you’re thinking that when you’re standing at the entrance to heaven, you’ll be hoping that you’ve been good enough to get in, then Jesus says here in these verses that you’re in for a big disappointment. No matter how good you are, it’s not good enough. That leaves us all in a tough spot. It means that no one is qualified to enter God’s kingdom.

So, where does that leave us?

After reading these verses, it means that we need something. These verses tell us four things that we need when it comes to being good.
<p><font size="+1">
Righteousness</font></p>
<p>
I’m not righteous enough to enter the kingdom. Correct.
You need someone else’s righteousness.<br>
<font color= "blue">
Therefore by the deeds of the law no flesh will be justified in His sight, for by the law is the knowledge of sin. But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, even the righteousness of God, through faith in Jesus Christ, to all and on all who believe. For there is no difference; (Rom 3:20-22)</font>
<br>
This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who believe.

When we put our trust in Jesus, He gives us His righteousness.<br> In God’s eyes, He makes us completely righteous.<br>
<font color= "blue">
What the law was powerless to do ... God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. (Rom 8:3-4)</font><br>

The law has not been abolished. It’s still there and it still reveals God’s will.<br> But through Jesus, I have met all its requirements.<br>

There’s a second thing from these verses that we know we need.
<p><font size="+1">
The Old Testament</font></p>
<p>
<font color= "blue">
All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work. (2 Tim 3:16-17)</font><br>

This is speaking of the Old Testament.<br> It is still God’s guide for us.<br> It is still a revelation of His righteous character.<br>

A third thing Jesus says that we need:
<p><font size="+1">
To do right</font></p>
<p>

We don’t need to do the right thing in order to win God’s love and acceptance. We already have that. God’s love and acceptance are based not on what we do, but on what Jesus did for us.<br>

We don’t need to do the right thing in order to look good to others. It doesn’t matter what other people think of us.

There are three good reasons why we need to do the right thing.</p>
<p>
First, the best reason to do the right thing is because it is good for us.<br>

We often think of sin as a restriction from something good. “Keep away from that!” But sin is not a candy; it’s a poison. The reason God tells us to keep away is because it will kill us. So doing right is good for us.</p>
<p>
Second, doing right is what we were made for. Good is what we were meant to be. He gave us righteousness (that means He forgave us and declared us righteous) so that His righteousness would change who we are, effecting every area of our lives. Christ saved us so we could become like Him, not just in right behaviour, but also in right thinking and believing.</p>
<p>
Third, and perhaps most important, when we do right, we are preparing a gift to bring pleasure to the most important person in our life, Jesus. If you have been forgiven and you understand what Jesus has done for you, how can you not love Him and want to show Him that love? We often show love to people by giving them gifts. Do you know how we show our love for God?
<font color= "blue"><br>
For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome. (1 John 5:3)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Therefore we make it our aim, whether present or absent, to be well pleasing to Him. For we must all appear before the judgement seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad. (2 Cor 5:9-10)</font><br>

Reading this verse, it’s easy to think of this judgement as a trial.<br> We immediately feel guilty (like getting called into the principals office).<br>

But that’s not what this judgement seat of Christ is like. 
One day we are going to stand before God at a celebration in His honour. By the way we live our lives we are preparing a gift for Him, the one who created us, forgave us, rescued us, cared for us and brought us back to life forever. On that day, the gifts will be opened and the contents revealed. What will you be giving the King at His celebration?</p>
<p>
I believe that is the situation with our gift for Jesus. Only while we are here on earth do we have the opportunity to prepare our gift for Him—a gift designed to bring Him pleasure—our obedience.<br>

(I know right now, heaven seems a long way off. Maybe you don’t really feel like preparing a gift for Jesus—you’d rather please yourself. I know. I often feel that way.)<br>

But when we all stand before Him on that day, I think we will suddenly realise fully the extent of what Jesus has done for us. On that day, we’ll finally get it. And we will want to be able to give Jesus everything. We’ll want to show Him our love, our complete devotion and allegiance. But at that point, all the shopping days will be over. Whatever gift we have prepared is the only one we will have to present.<br>

On that day, when all the gifts are opened, we might want to give Jesus more, but we will only be able to honour Him with what we have already done with our lives here on earth. That is why it is so important to do what is right. <br>Because of God’s grace, our relationship with Him will never be threatened, but at His celebration, we will want to please Him with the way we have faithfully followed Him.</p>
<p>
This verse also gives us another reason to do right. At that same celebration to honour Jesus, after we have honoured Him by opening our presents, the Bible says that we will be rewarded for what we have done. <br>

But let’s go back to our list. After reading these verses, I realise that I need:
<p><font size="+1">
To be genuine</font></p>
<p>

Jesus said, “Your righteousness must be greater than that of the Pharisees. Although Pharisees were on very good behaviour, Jesus criticised the Pharisees and scribes for being hypocrites.<br>
<font color= "blue">
"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you cleanse the outside of the cup and dish, but inside they are full of extortion and self-indulgence. <br>(Matt 23:25 )</font></p>
