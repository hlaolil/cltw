The man at the Pool
</h1>
<p>
Much has been said by way of comment and speculation concerning the poor man in this miracle of Jesus.  Many note how Jesus asked the man that all important question, <font color= "blue"> “Do you want to be made well?” (John 5:6)</font>. <br> All of us probably know people in our life experiences who really don’t want to be well for one reason or another.  It is almost impossible for one in such a frame of mind to actually get well.  Even miraculous cures may not last in such cases.  Also for some Jerusalem beggars with good locations it appears that they may make a pretty good living doing nothing.</p><p>

<p>
Various commentators have noted that the story of this man is a sort of parable or allegory picturing Israel and her lame condition. <br> The man had been an invalid for 38 years.  In their thinking this corresponds to the 38 years Israel was in the wilderness (Deut 2:14) and unable to enter the Promised Land.  </p><p>In fact, at that very hour Israel was still an invalid, unable to enter into the good things God had in store.  Some have suggested that the five porches represent the law while the waters represent baptism and salvation
in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>
It is interesting that the man does not appear to show much faith.<br>  This miracle seems to almost be one of grace alone.  Clearly the man continues to think in near magical terms of the angel stirring the waters. <br> Incidentally, John 5:3-4 which speak of the angel stirring the water are missing in all early manuscripts of the Bible before AD 400.  Thus they are omitted in many newer translations.  It may well have been that this account was an early oral tradition carried on by believers although not included in the earliest copies of the Bible.</p>
<p>
Others have pointed out that this man never seemed to show much gratitude for being healed.  He did go immediately to the Temple where Jesus later found him and that was a good sign.  This trip to the Temple was surely one he had not been able to make on his own for 38 years. Still it is of note that he didn’t face the immediate persecution that the blind man of John chapter 9 faced, since the latter was excommunicated for his belief in Jesus.</p>
<p>
In the man’s Temple exchange with Jesus we see that his condition was apparently the result of some specific sin in his life.  Obviously all sicknesses and even death are caused indirectly by sin and the fact that we have inherited these things from Adam.  It is clear in scripture that certain sins cause specific problems in our lives.<br> For instance, the sin of <font color= "blue">envy is rottenness to the bones (Prov 14:30)</font>. <br> The sin of pride <font color= "blue">goes before destruction (Prov 16:18)</font>. <br> The sin of greed <font color= "blue">takes away the life of its owners (Prov 1:19)</font>. <br> We do not know what his specific sin was but Jesus gave him a sharp command <font color= "blue">"Sin no more, lest a worse thing come upon you.” (John 5:14)</font>.</p>

Some Applications from Bethesda
</h3>
<p>
It may be appropriate that we ask ourselves if we have some 38-year-old problem that always lingers with us.  This miracle tells us that there is still grace for us and that the Messiah may actually be seeking us out for a special miracle.  But we must quickly ask ourselves “Do I really want to be delivered from this problem?”  Some sins and problems tend to get pretty comfortable after a few years, to the point that we cannot even bear the thought of losing them.</p>
<p>
Then there is the matter of gratitude.  We are instructed in Phil 4:<br> <font color= "blue">“In everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God;” (Phil 4:6)</font>
</p>
<p>
Ingratitude is one of the most dangerous sins in that it literally locks the door against God’s future miracles and blessings in our lives.  As with the children of Israel long ago ingratitude sentences us to years of futility and wilderness wandering.</p>
<p>
Last of all it can be said that the poor helpless man did obey the command of Jesus.  It must have sounded crazy to him but he began to stand up and pick up his mat.  All miracles seem to start this way.  God begins from where we are and with what we have, and then He works His miracle around these things.</p>
