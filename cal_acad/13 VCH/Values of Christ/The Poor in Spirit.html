   <h1>
The Poor in Spirit
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of 

heaven. (Matt 5:3 )</font></p>
<p>
The “poor in spirit” are those who cast themselves on God's grace.<br> 

We personally acknowledge our spiritual bankruptcy before God. <br>It 

is the tax collector in the temple, beating his breast and 

saying,<br><font color= "blue">“God, be merciful to me, a sinner” 

(Luke 18:13)</font>.<br> It is an honest confession that we are sinful 

and utterly without moral virtues needed to please God. It is the 

opposite of arrogance. In its deepest form, it acknowledges our 

desperate need for God. Jesus is declaring that it is a blessing 

to recognise our need to be filled by God’s grace.</p>
<p>
Thus, at the very beginning of the Sermon on the Mount, we learn 

that we don’t have the spiritual resources in ourselves to put 

Jesus’ teachings into practice. We can't fulfil God’s call by 

ourselves. Blessed are those who realise they are spiritually 

bankrupt, for this realisation turns them to God, without whom 

they cannot fulfil what they are created to do and be.<br> Much of the 

rest of the sermon rips away from us the self-delusion that we are 

capable of acquiring a state of blessedness on our own. It aims to 

produce in us a genuine poverty of spirit.</p>
<p>
What is the practical result of this blessing? If we are poor in 

spirit, we are able to bring an honest appraisal of ourselves to 

our work. We don't inflate our résumé or boast about our position. 

We know how difficult it is to work with people who cannot learn, 

grow, or accept correction because they are trying to maintain an 

inflated picture of themselves. So we commit ourselves to honesty 

about ourselves. We remember that even Jesus, when He started 

working with wood, must have needed guidance and instruction. At 

the same time, we acknowledge that only with God at work within us 

can we put Jesus’ teachings into practice on the job. We seek 

God’s presence and strength in our lives each day as we live as 

Christians where we work.</p>
<p>
In the fallen world, poverty of spirit may seem to be a hindrance 

to success and advancement. Often this is an illusion. Who is 

likely to be more successful in the long run? A leader who says, 

“Fear not, I can handle anything, just do as I say,” or a leader 

who says, “Together, we can do it, but everyone will have to 

perform better than ever before.” If there was ever a time when an 

arrogant, self-promoting leader was considered greater than a 

humble, empowering leader, that time is passing, at least within 

the best organisations.<br> For example, a humble leader is the first 

characteristic mark of companies that achieve sustained greatness, 

according to Jim Collins’ well-known research. <br>Of course, many 

workplaces remain stuck in the old kingdom of self-promotion and 

inflated self-appraisal. In some situations, the best practical 

advice may be to find another workplace if at all possible. In 

other cases, leaving the job may not be possible, or it may not be 

desirable, because by staying a Christian could be an important 

force for good.<br> In these situations, the poor in spirit are all 

the more a blessing to those around them.</p>
