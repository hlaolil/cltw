Now a woman, having a flow of blood for twelve years, who had spent all her livelihood on physicians and could not be healed by any, came from behind and touched the border of His garment. And immediately her flow of blood stopped. (Luke 8:43-48)</font></p>

This healing event is about a women with a flow of blood who interrupted Jesus on his way to heal Jairus' daughter (Luke 8:41). We do not know if this woman had a genetic blood disorder such a haemophilia or a female condition that produced a flow of blood. But we do know this healing event stopped Jesus in route to heal Jairus' daughter. Jairus was a ruler of the synagogue whose daughter was at the point of death (Luke 8:41). Jesus went with Jairus to heal his daughter and a large crowd followed and pressed around Jesus. Large crowds pressing on Jesus was nothing new for the ministry of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>
This woman with an issue of blood, came behind Jesus in the crowd and touched His garment (Luke 8:43-44). Jesus immediately turned around in the crowd and said, <font color= "blue">"Who touched Me?" (Luke 8:45)</font> <font color= "blue">But His disciples said to Him, “You see the multitude thronging You, and You say, "Who touched Me?” (Luke 5:31)</font> Numerous people touching Jesus for healing was common. What was so significant that Jesus stopped, turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched My clothes"? (Mark 5:30)</p>
<p>
The woman with the issue of blood, demonstrates how to obtain the healing power of God by the grace of Jesus Christ through faith that produces wholeness. The scripture states, <font color= "blue">"When she heard about Jesus" (Mark 5:27)</font>. Someone told her about Jesus. She was obviously told the right things about Jesus (Luke 5:15). She would not been looking for Jesus if she was hearing, "Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?"; or "He is a Samaritan, and has a devil"; or "He deceives the people"; or "He casts out devils through Beelzebub the chief of the devils"; or "he breaks the Sabbath by healing" (John 1:46, John 8:48, John 7:12, Luke 11:15, Luke 13:14). In many churches today they are not preaching Jesus. They preach certain aspects about Jesus in accordance with their man-made doctrines. But multitudes of people have never hear about the saving, delivering, and healing Jesus.</p>

How then shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? (Rom 10:13-14)</font>
This woman could have stayed home when she heard about Jesus. She had many reasons to be discouraged and depressed. The scriptures states that she <font color= "blue">had a flow of blood for twelve years ... (Matt 9:20)</font>. She had suffered many things from many physicians and was not better, in fact, she was worse. She <font color= "blue">had spent all her livelihood on physicians and could not be healed by any, (Luke 8:43)</font>. She felt weak and tired. Maybe she didn't want to fight through the crowds to reach Jesus. Under Jewish law, she was considered unclean [Lev 15:19, 25-27]. She was to be "separated" and cry "unclean" (Lev 15:7, 10, Num 5:2, Lev 13:45). The scripture states in the Old Testament, that if you will "serve the LORD your God, He will bless your bread and your water, and take sickness away from the midst of you" (Ex 23:25, Ex 15:26). Maybe this woman felt God was punishing her for some sin. Perhaps she felt God was cursing her with this disease. This woman probably felt very depressed and dejected. But when she had heard of Jesus, she went looking for Him (Mark 5:27).</p>
<p>
The Woman with the issue of blood, didn't have any influential advocates like the Roman Centurion did. She wasn't able to ask the Jewish elders to go to Jesus on her behalf. There were no Jewish Elders beseeching Jesus that he should heal her for, unlike Jairus who <font color= "blue">"loves our nation and has built us a synagogue" (Luke 7:3-5),</font> she had nothing to offer. The Roman Centurion was not Jewish but he had gained favour with Jewish leaders by building a synagogue. This woman had spent all her money on physicians but only grew worse (Luke 8:43). At this point she is destitute without the resource of money (Eccl 7:11).<br>
No one was advocating or beseeching Jesus on her behalf. The bible doesn't even give the woman's name. We only know her by the condition that she suffered with for 12 years.</p>
<p>
Let's also look at the difference between the woman with the issue of blood and Naaman the leper. Naaman wanted someone to come and heal him (2 King 5:11). But the woman with the issue of blood went looking for Jesus. She pressed through and overcame obstacles. She pressed through the crowd. She wouldn't take no for an answer. She fought the good fight of faith. She kept her focus on Jesus. She demonstrated her faith or confidence in Jesus by her determination.</p>
<p>
The woman with the issue of blood was using her faith (her confidence in Jesus) by "saying". Jesus said, "If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say" (Matt 17:20). Real biblical faith is believing what God has already done by grace through Christ Jesus. Real faith only appropriates what Jesus has already provided. In this woman's case, Jesus hadn't provided physical healing through His atoning work at Calvary. But she knew this:

For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had plagues [Mark 3:10]. And the whole multitude sought to touch him: for there went virtue out of him, and healed them all [Luke 6:19]. Wherever He entered, into villages, cities, or the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged Him that they might just touch the hem of His garment. And as many as touched Him were made well [Mark 6:33].
But she believed one thing, if she touched Jesus she would be whole. Remember the woman's faith did not move God. Faith does not move God, it moves us. Jesus had already demonstrated over and over that he would heal all. Jesus demonstrated over and over that He was both willingly and able to heal all. The woman's faith was only appropriating what Jesus was willingly to give. Faith is not something that you do but something that you believe Jesus will do.

The Bible states, faith is the substances of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen (Heb 11:1). Her new faith talk, filled her hope with faith. Her faith produced a new faith image of being whole, not growing worse. What is your inner faith image? Do you see yourself growing worse or whole? What is your inner self talk? What are you saying to yourself about God and His Word? What are you saying about the finished work of Jesus at Calvary? What is your statement of faith? This woman's statement of faith was, "If I may touch but his clothes, I shall be whole" (Mark 5:28). Jesus said, "whosoever shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass; he shall have whatsoever he saith" (Mark 11:23).
Jesus is your source for eternal salvation, physical healing, deliverance, prosperity, and everything that you need (John 10:9). God wants you healed and he has provided many options for you to receive what Jesus has already provided.
This woman illustrates important concept that God is not a respecter of persons and will not show partiality or favouritism (Acts 10:34, God is Not a Respecter of Persons). If Jesus healed all that came to Him for physical healing in the Bible, will he not do the same for you? The Scripture states that Jesus, "healed them that had need of healing" (Luke 9:11).</p>

However, if you are born-again believer, Jesus has already provided this grace to you. You are already complete in Jesus. Jesus is already inside of you. The Life of God is already in you. You don't have to press through a crowd to reach Jesus like this woman. You don't have to get God's attention. This woman did because, Jesus had not yet died and provided the atonement for sin which causes disease. Jesus has already accomplished your salvation, healing, prosperity, and deliverance and placed it in your born-again spirit, new creation. Believers aren't waiting on God to move in the New Testament. We are looking back to the Cross where Jesus said "it is finished". Just make a demand on the healing power and minister the healing power to your body. Faith is not something you do that makes God move. God has already done all that He is ever going to do through Jesus Christ. Studying the Bible, confessing the Word, acting on the Word, etc, are all involved in the faith process, but in themselves they aren't "faith". Faith doesn't make God do anything. Faith just appropriates what Jesus has already done.
