<h1>
The Discipline of Fasting

"When you fast, do not look sombre as the hypocrites do, for they disfigure their faces to show men they are fasting. (Matt 6:16) </font></p>
<h3>
Ostentatious Fasting
</h3>
<p>
Jesus uses a couple words here to describe the way these showoffs were fasting. First the word “sombre” means simply that they put on very sad faces. They looked terrible. It also says they “disfigured” their faces which sounds like they cut themselves or something. But literally the phrase means that they made their faces “invisible”. You know what that’s probably talking about is the ashes that often accompany mourning and fasting. In other words, they smeared ashes all over their faces, which made their faces invisible, but made their fasting very visible. It was obvious to everyone what they were doing. And that’s the point. They wanted it to be obvious they were fasting, so that people would notice them and recognise what wonderfully spiritual people they were.</p>
<p>
But Jesus says, they are completely missing the point of fasting:<br>

I tell you the truth, they have received their reward in full.

When people noticed them fasting, that was the only reward they got. They wanted the recognition of men and that’s what they got. That’s all they got. Their fasting was not sincere worship; it was ostentatious. They were showoffs. And that’s not the kind of worship God desires.
That is ostentatious worship, religious acts designed to impress people instead of serving God. Notice the key elements in this type of fasting:

Ostentatious fasting</font></p>
<p>
Action: It is public suffering: visibly sad and pitiful.

Motive: It is done for man’s praise.

Result: The reward is paid in full. You receive human praise.
<h3>
Secret Fasting
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, so that you do not appear to men to be fasting, but to your Father who is in the secret place; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you openly. (Matt 6:17-18)</font></p>
<p>
The point here is the opposite of letting everyone know you’re fasting. The oil he’s talking about here was just a regular part of hygiene in that day.

It means basically that when you fast, wash your face and comb your hair. Don’t try to make sure that everyone knows you’re fasting. Are you fasting to concentrate on God? Great! Then it’s really just between you and Him. No one else needs to know. So don’t be obvious about it.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Always “in secret”?</font></p>
<p>
Does that mean that you must keep all fasting a secret? I don’t think so. I don’t think this verse means that all fasting must be done in private. There are examples in the New Testament of groups fasting together. And as we saw earlier, Jesus doesn’t mean that there’s anything wrong with people knowing that you give, that you pray, or that you fast. The problem is when you do those things so that people will know you’re doing them.</p>
<p>
Jesus is not saying that you have done wrong if people know you’re fasting. He’s not saying it’s wrong if people are impressed by your fasting. What He’s saying is that it is wrong to fast for the purpose of impressing people. It’s not an issue of who knows about it or what they think about it. It’s all about your motive. Why did you do it? For people? Or for God?</p>
<p>
So, even if you’re fasting with other people, keep your fasting a personal thing, just between you and God, and then your motives won’t be in question. God sees even what no one else can see.

The reason it’s so important to guard our motives in fasting is because the reason why we fast will determine how it effects our lives. Jesus urges us to fast in secret, so that our motives will be completely pure.

and your Father, who sees what is done in secret, will reward you.

Those who fast from pure motives will be rewarded by God.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
What “reward”?</font></p>
<p>
Just what is this reward? The Bible doesn’t promise a specific reward for fasting. But I think we can make a pretty good guess. In the Bible, the thing that drives people to fast is their deep concern, their profound need for God to hear them and act. Perhaps that is the reward of fasting. If you are so intent on connecting with God that you skip a meal or two, then you will connect with God. It’s not because you were fasting. It’s because you were sincerely seeking God. And those who really seek him will find him. However, those who pretend, those who put on a show of seeking God, just so that people will admire them, they won’t connect with God. All they get is human admiration. The one who fasts will be rewarded. But that reward is only for those who fast with a pure motive.</p>
<p>
Now we can see the complete contrast between ostentatious fasting and secret fasting:
<p><font size="+1">
Secret fasting</font></p>
<p>
Action: is not a public performance, but a private discipline. 
You are so focused on God that you’re not thinking about eating. It’s fasting for an exclusive audience of one.

Motive: The reason for fasting is not to get recognition from 
men, but rather to honour God and concentrate on him.

Result: The result is not praise from men, but rather
a reward from God. You really do connect with him.

Conclusion
</h3>
<p><font size="+1">
Kingdom worship</font></p>
<p>
This last act of worship, fasting, is a little bit different than the other’s we’ve talked about: giving or praying. God wants you give and He wants you to pray. Those are commands. But you know what, I don’t think God really cares if you fast or not. What He wants is your complete devotion. And at times, that devotion may be so focused that you don’t care about eating. And that honours God—not because you went hungry, but because you evidently cared so much about Him that food—something you need to survive—was just not that important to you.</p>
<p>
So if that’s why you’re fasting—because you desperately want to worship God—then go ahead and skip your meals. God is honoured by that kind of devotion.

That’s why it’s so important that you fast with the right motives. You can go without food for 40 days for all the wrong reasons—so that people will praise you—but then that’s all you will get—people’s praise.

On the other hand, you can skip a single meal—only because you truly want to honour God—and for that God will reward you. The question is not, “Are you fasting? The important question is, “Why are you fasting?”</p>

Notes</font></p>
<p>
The other idea about fasting is that it helps to exercise the spiritual muscles that allow us to refuse to indulge the desires of the flesh. The desire for food is a bodily desire (though not forbidden). Saying “no” to that bodily desire may help us learn the discipline of saying “no” to other bodily desires that are forbidden. I think in practice this works. However, there is no biblical support for this purpose in fasting unless there is a deeply veiled allusion to fasting in 1 Cor 9:27, “I beat my body and make it my slave.” In the same way, fasting may indeed have a health benefit. But that does not make it either a biblical or a legitimate reason to fast.

The other popular idea, that fasting supercharges prayer, is based in part on a textual variant of Matt 17:21 and Mark 9:29 which says some exorcisms can only be accomplished “by prayer and fasting”. This idea is not in the autographs. There is no biblical support for fasting in order to empower your prayers. Once again, in practice this may work. God may indeed be more likely to answer the prayers of those who fast. The reason, however, is not because they are fasting, but because they are sincerely and wholeheartedly seeking God. That kind of seeking—with or without fasting—is going to get God’s response.</p>
