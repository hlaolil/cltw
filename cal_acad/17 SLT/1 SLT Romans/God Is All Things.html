God Is All Things
</h1>
<h3>
Praising God
</h3>
<p>
As Paul reflects on the God of mercy and grace and the plan that He has for the redemption of a people, he is simply overwhelmed with praise.  He overflows with adoration for the God about which he has been writing.  And of course, such a response is quite appropriate.  How else can one respond to the God of all grace?  After giving us several reasons to praise God, Paul closes with this thought: To Him be glory forever.</p>  
<p>
My hope is that as we reflect on the reasons that Paul lists for praising and adoring God we will say with Paul: all glory to Him, all glory to Him!! <br> Again, keeping in mind what Paul has been teaching us about God and His plan for redemption, what specific reasons does he give for worship?  <br>Even though I could break them into three groups, let me just walk through the list and as I do, let me encourage you to be amazed at our glorious God.
<h3>
The Depth Of His Riches
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! <br>How unsearchable are His judgements and His ways past finding out! <br>“For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has become His counsellor?” “Or who has first given to Him and it shall be repaid to him?” <br>For of Him and through Him and to Him are all things, to whom be glory forever." (Rom 11:33-36)</font><br>
Paul is praising God for the depth of the riches both of His wisdom and knowledge. So what does Paul mean by the depth of His riches?  I think he helps us to understand each of these words with the rhetorical questions that he quotes from the Old Testament in Rom 11:34-35.</p>  
<p>
The question that parallels the depth of God’s riches is found in Rom 11:35. <br> Paul quotes from God’s speech to Job:<br> <font color= "blue">Who has preceded Me, that I should pay him? (Job 41:11).</font>  <br>What could a person ever give to God that he has not first received from God?  The depth of God?'s riches is untold.  He needs nothing from us.  There is nothing we could give to add to Him.  No, we are the recipients.  In light of what Paul has written in Rom 9-11, we can easily see how this applies to our salvation.  <br>What could we offer to God for our salvation?  Nothing.  Our salvation bears witness to the depth of His riches and kindness toward us in Christ.  <br>Praise Him for the depth of His riches.</p>
<h3>
The Depth of His Wisdom
</h3>
<p>
God is infinitely wise.  We see this clearly displayed in His plan for the salvation for both Jews and Gentiles.  His plan is perfectly wise.  The question that parallels His wisdom is found in:<br> <font color= "blue">"or who has become His counsellor?" (Rom 11:34; Isa 40:13).</font>  <br>God does not need any advice or counsel from us.  His plan for our salvation is wise in every way, even if we cannot understand or explain all of the details. <br> We should praise Him for the depths of His wisdom.</p> 
<h3>
The Depth of His Knowledge
</h3>
<p>
Some group wisdom and knowledge together since they are so similar, but I think a distinction can be made.  God’s knowledge refers to the fact that absolutely nothing escapes Him. He knows all things. His wisdom refers to His perfect application of what He knows.  He knows all things and He knows what to do with that knowledge.  The parallel question is found in:<br><font color= "blue"> "For who has known the mind of the Lord?" (Rom 11:34; Isa 40:13).</font> <br> We cannot even begin to comprehend the extent of God’s knowledge.<br> As Isaiah notes <font color= "blue">“For My thoughts are not your thoughts," (Isa 55:8-9),</font> <br>His thoughts are way above our thoughts.  Some might say it is like comparing the mind of the smartest human to the mind of an ant, but even that is not even close.  Not only do we not know what He knows, we cannot even begin to grasp the difference between our knowledge and His. <br> O praise Him for the depths of His knowledge.</p>
<h3>
His Unsearchable Judgements
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God!<br> How unsearchable are His judgements and His ways past finding out!" <br>(Rom 11:33b).</font>  <br>Both of these reasons describe God’s actions. Paul mentions God’s unsearchable judgements.  This is not simply a reference to God’s judicial decisions (right and wrong, innocent and guilty, etc.).  No, Paul is most likely referring to all of God’s decisions.  His decisions are unsearchable, meaning that they simply cannot be brought into question.  He is the Creator and His judgements for the creation are above reproach.  This reminds us of what Paul has already said about God in Rom 9:19-24.</p> 
<p>
God has absolute rights over the creation since He made it.  He is the Potter and we are the clay.  Yet, we need to note the connection with God’s wisdom and knowledge and goodness.  His judgements are unsearchable because He has all wisdom and all knowledge.  We can trust His every decision.  Even as we struggle with some of the difficult teaching of Paul, we can still trust in the Lord and His goodness.  We can praise Him for His unsearchable judgements.</p>
<h3>
His Inscrutable Ways
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways," (Isa 55:9).</font>  <br>God’s thoughts are higher than ours and His ways are higher than ours. <br> Paul describes them as inscrutable, or untraceable.  Let’s just be honest with ourselves, when we look at certain circumstances, we cannot always figure out what God is doing.  His ways are beyond us.  We cannot get our heads around everything that is happening (or has ever happened or will happen) all at once.  We cannot see the complete picture.  But God does.  He sees it all.  He has a plan for it all.</p>
<p>
Schreiner notes: “Human beings see the bare events as they transpire, but they do not perceive the saving plan of God that is being accomplished in and through these events.”  Of course, we need to note that God has revealed the broad strokes of His plan to us through His Word and the Word who became flesh.  His plan for His people is to use all the circumstances and situations in their lives to conform them to the image of His Son. <br> O praise the Lord for His inscrutable ways!</p>
<h3>
All Things Are From Him
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"For of Him and through Him and to Him are all things, to whom be glory forever." (Rom 11:36)</font><br>
Paul gives us more reasons to praise the Lord.  Look at that verse. <br> We are to praise God because all things are from Him. <br> Everything that is owes its existence to Him. <br> He is the Creator and the Sustainer of all things. <br> You belong to Him for your existence, every breath you breathe, is from Him.</p>
<p>
Not only is He the source of all things, but He is the means of all things.  Everything we have is through him.  In particular, in light of what Paul has written thus far in the letter, we can surely say that our redemption is through His work.  His plan to send Christ, Christ’s work on the cross, the Spirit’s conviction in our hearts, all demonstrate that our salvation is through Him. <br> We could never save ourselves, but through Him we have new life in Christ. <br> O praise Him for all things are through Him.</p>
<p>
Not only is He the source of all things and the means of all things, but all things exist for Him.  His glory is the goal of all things.  The old confession gets it right: the chief end of man is to glorify Him and enjoy Him forever.  The point of your life is God’s glory.  The reason for your existence is to bring Him praise.<br>  Again, our salvation is ultimately for God’s glory and nothing proclaims the greatness of our God like His redemption of a people through the death of His Son.  May everything we are and everything we do bring glory to His Name.  Praise Him for all things are to Him!</p>
<h3>
Be Amazed At What God Does
</h3>
<p>
Again, Paul closes with these appropriate words: To Him be glory forever.  Amen.  Paul is amazed.  He is overwhelmed.  He scarce can take it in.  God’s plan to save a people has left him breathless.  And so should it leave us.  But let me be frank and simply confess: I am not as amazed as I should be.  And my problem is not that it takes too much to amaze me.  I am impressed with athletes and artists all the time.  I get excited over smaller things constantly.  No, my problem (and maybe it is yours) is that I am far too easily distracted.  I know that my salvation is glorious.  I know that God sending His own Son to redeem a wretch like me is unbelievably amazing.</p>  
<p>
We just so often get sidetracked by other things.  As Rich Mullins so aptly put it: “The stuff of earth competes for the allegiance I owe only to the Giver of all good things.”  <br> Maybe you know this struggle.  Maybe it has been a long time since you truly stood amazed before God and His plan to redeem your soul. <br> Let me encourage you today: be still and know the Lord. <br> Meditate on the love that God has shown us in Christ.  Focus on His work on the cross. <br> Remember the Lord’s plan to conform you to His image and respond with praise. <br> Say with Paul:  Oh, the depth ... Oh, the depth ... to Him be glory forever.</p>
