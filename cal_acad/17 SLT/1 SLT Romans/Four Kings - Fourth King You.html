 <h1>
Four Kings - Fourth King You
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Rom 8:37-39)</font></p>
<p>
The victory is ours through Christ. Through the unquestioned, total victory that comes with His death, resurrection, and His on-going intercession, we become super-conquerors—more than conquerors. We take a vast spoil through the conquering efforts of Christ. He made the sacrifice; we take the prize.</p>
<h3>
Other Witnesses
</h3>
<p>
Carrying on this thought, let us notice a few other scriptures:<br>
<font color= "blue">
"Now thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and through us diffuses the fragrance of His knowledge in every place." (2 Cor 2:14)</font><br>

Paul here starts out by thanking God “who always leads us in triumph in Christ.</p>
<p>
Let us notice some Old Testament witnesses to God’s struggle to conquer for us. We will start in Micah 7, a particularly beautiful millennial passage, but one with meaning for God’s people today.<br>
<font color= "blue">
"Who is a God like You, pardoning iniquity and passing over the transgression of the remnant of His heritage? He does not retain His anger forever, because He delights in mercy. He will again have compassion on us, and will subdue our iniquities. You will cast all our sins into the depths of the sea. You will give truth to Jacob and mercy to Abraham, which You have sworn to our fathers from days of old." (Micah 7:18-20)</font><br>
Did you catch it? It is God who “subdues our iniquities.” The Hebrew verb subdue here means, “to bring into subjection.” It is often used of people being conquered and brought into slavery.</p>
<p> 
It may be instructive to notice more where God covenants with David in <br>1 Chron.<br>
<font color= "blue">
"Moreover I will appoint a place for My people Israel, and will plant them, that they may dwell in a place of their own and move no more; nor shall the sons of wickedness oppress them anymore, as previously, since the time that I commanded judges to be over My people Israel. Also I will subdue all your enemies. (1 Chron 17:9-10)</font><br>
We understand the spiritual meaning behind this passage. God subdues our spiritual enemies.</p>
<p>
Let's take notice of three verses from the Psalms. First, Psa 60 where David confidently acclaims God’s commitment to give us the victory.<br>
<font color= "blue">
"Through God we will do valiantly, for it is He who shall tread down our enemies." (Psa 60:12)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"As far as the east is from the west, so far has He removed our transgressions from us." (Psa 103:12)</font></p>
<p>
Now in Psa 130, the Psalmist again points out God's role in conquering sin:<br>
<font color= "blue">
"And He shall redeem Israel From all his iniquities." (Psa 130:8)</font></p>
<p>
Finally, notice Isa 38:<br>
<font color= "blue">
"... But You have lovingly delivered my soul from the pit of corruption, for You have cast all my sins behind Your back." (Isa 38:17)</font></p>
<p>
In all these cases we have looked at, this point is clear: God takes action first, carrying the victory, while others follow on to take the prize.<br> Notice the sequence, as the Apostle Paul states it in Rom 5:<br>
<font color= "blue">
"But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him." (Rom 5:8-9 )</font></p>
<p>
No wonder we love Him—<font color= "blue">“because He first loved us,” (1 John 4:19)</font> <br>The Apostle John clearly states there the sequence: 
God acts first—wins first; we later enjoy the prize of His victory.</p>
