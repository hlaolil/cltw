Justified - Romans 5

<h3>
Religion
</h3>
<p>
It surprises many well meaning Christians to find out that the Law brings death. We learn the Ten Commandments as children and society as a whole believes in the golden rule, <font color= "blue">"whatever you want men to do to you, do also to them," (Matt 7:12)</font> Both Christians and society understand the need for law and order in order to function. However what religion has done is take the very thing that was given to destroy us and has made it into a vehicle whereby to obtain salvation. This is misleading and destructive in every way. What religion fails to tell you is that this is impossible to obtain the righteousness required by the law through works the law. Paul said <font color= "blue">"for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life." (2 Cor 3:6)</font> In other words, the law brings about death and the only way to live is by the Spirit.
<h3>
Justified by Faith
</h3>
<p>
Paul supports this revelation in today's passage giving us clarity to why the law was given. The law was given so that trespasses might increase. Remember up until the time the law was given, sin was not taken into account nor held against man. (Rom 5:13). But humankind mistook God's forbearance with sin as His acceptance of it, so the law was given to show mankind the contrast between their sin and God's holy standards. In the same way, the sole purpose of the law was not to fulfil it in order to get to God, but instead it pointed towards faith in Christ as our Saviour. He was only one who could fulfil the letter of the law breaking the curse of death, providing the means to be reconciled to God.</p> 
<p>
Paul makes this very clear, <font color= "blue">"What purpose then does the law serve? It was added because of transgressions, till the Seed should come to whom the promise was made;" (Gal 3:19)</font> The laws sole purpose was to point us to Christ. The law requirements in stark comparison to our sin and good deeds shows us how utterly unobtainable fulfilling it is. That is why we must have faith. Faith in Jesus who provided that precious payment for our sins. Through Him we are made perfect thus fulfilling the law. Paul summarises this most profoundly,<font color= "blue"> "Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from the deeds of the law." (Rom 3:28)</font> Which means the only way to be justified is by faith in a Saviour and that Saviour is Jesus.</p>
<h3>
Alive in Christ's Grace
</h3>
<p>
So trespasses increased under the law. The law brought death.<font color= "blue"> "so that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord" (Rom 5:21)</font> So through Jesus we received abundant grace and abundant life. And if we are alive in Christ, then death as the result of sin has no hold on us. And if we have been forgiven and cleansed of all sin, then we no longer are in need of the law, which brings death. </p>
<p>
Col 2 is a powerful passage of scripture, it says,<font color= "blue"> "And you, being dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He has made alive together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses, having wiped out the handwriting of requirements that was against us, which was contrary to us. And He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross. Having disarmed principalities and powers, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in it. So let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or Sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ." (Col 2:13-17)</font> 
So knowing that we have died to the old man, or sinful nature we are free to live in Christ, reigning in righteousness. Christ has cancelled the written code that stood opposed to us calling for death and has made us alive in Him through faith.</p>
<p>
Today, remember that you are freed from the law in order to live to the Lord. His spirit gives us freedom to celebrate eternal life. Today I celebrate His grace and thank Him for freedom in His beautiful name!</p>
