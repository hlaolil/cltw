<h3>
The Problem of Indwelling Sin
 </h3>

What shall we say then? Is the law sin? Certainly not! On the contrary, I would not have known sin except through the law. For I would not have known covetousness unless the law had said, “You shall not covet. (Rom 7:7)</font></p>
 <p>
Rom 7:7 begins a train of thought which extends to Rom 8:11. The one continuous thread in these verses is how the law affects man’s behaviour, and how its fulfilment changes man’s outlook and character.</p>
 <p>
Paul was not attempting to mollify those who had been practising law as a means of justification, but he did want them to understand the proper place of law. He began with two questions: "What then shall we say? Is the law sin?"</p>
 <p>
Some had accused Paul of saying that the law was sin. He was not saying that at all, but he did say that sin uses the law against those who subject themselves to it in order to increase its (sin’s) own power. The body of the sin is increased by those who attempt to please God by their own power (keeping the law), because law is the strength or power of sin.</p>
 <p>
Paul answered his own questions negatively: "God forbid," or may it not be! Then he continued by saying he did not know sin except by law. In other words, law was for the express purpose of exposing sin. No one likes having their sins exposed to view, but Paul was going beyond the simple issue of exposure. Therefore, Paul was saying he would not have experienced either the act or the knowledge of sin unless, or except, for the law.</p>
 <p>
Remember, sin takes the power God intended for good and perverts that power to its own purposes through the willingness, or the deception, of men. Law is sin’s strength, sin receives its power from the law. How can this be? Where God intervenes, sin rises up against him. Those who live in the sphere of the Adamic nature, or flesh, help supply the power for sin to operate, both in their own lives and the lives of others in the community.</p>
 <p>
Have you ever thought, or said, that you want to raise your children in a good community? Well, have you dedicated yourself to God? Or, are you still living in the strength of your own desires, walking in the wisdom of your own mind instead of seeking wisdom from the word of God? Have you dedicated yourself to a separated walk, or do you walk as the world around you walks? Paul was saying that the law actually empowered sin in his life. Think about what he said! He used the absolute no, when he said he absolutely would not have known sin except by the law.</p>
 </p>
Paul said that if the law had not made him conscious of the sin of covetousness in his life that he would not have known about it otherwise. But "I would not have known sin except through the law, ... unless the law had said, You shall not covet." This was enough to cause the Adamic nature, or flesh, to rise up in rebellion against God and His law.</p>
 <p>
The effect of preaching law cannot be overemphasised because of the devastation such preaching causes. Law prods into action all the rebellion inherent in our fleshly natures, while God wants service based upon love. Men naturally offer service based upon their own doing, or fleshly service. Even worse, some consider this the epitome of Christianity.</p>
 <p><font color= "blue">
But sin, taking opportunity by the commandment, produced in me all manner of evil desire. For apart from the law sin was dead. ((Rom 7:8)) </font></p>
<p>
The first part of verse 7:8 makes a tremendous statement about the power sin derives from the fleshly nature involved with law. Paul said that the law, God’s commandment, can itself be a reason for sin. From opposition to the law, sin receives an impetus to lead men out of the way into covetousness. By his own admission, Paul said that sin produced in me all manner of evil desire. (Rom 7:8)</p>
 <p>
Law not only reveals sin, but sin uses it to work out its way in those who know not, or care not, about the sacrifice of Jesus Christ and the grace of God. Is it the fault of law? Of course not! Did the tree of knowledge of good and evil cause Adam and Eve to sin just because it was there? Of course not! Did the coming of Christ cause the sin of those who rejected Him? No!</p>
 <p>
God’s commandments represent the power of God, and thereby invite the rebellion of those who are not submissive to their creator. Paul was definitely pointing out how sin uses law to draw strength for misleading those who teach keeping of the law for their justification before God.</p.
 <p>
Even those who consider themselves followers of Jesus Christ often put themselves back under law. In Paul’s day, a major issue concerned circumcision. Some said circumcision was still required in spite of Christ’s sacrifice. Paul said that if they were circumcised then Christ was of absolutely no effect to them. Today, we must also watch that we do not fall into the same trap and provide power to sin.</p>
<h3>
Under the Law 
<h3>
 <p>
The last part of verse Rom 7:8 is a startling statement: "For apart from the law sin was dead." Sin lives by the law. It derives its very strength from the law. If God had not forbidden Adam and Eve to eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil there would have been no sin in their eating. But He did forbid it; therefore, when they ate, death entered into the world by their disobedience. Sin became the sting of death, and law became its strength.</p>
 <p>
Every impulse of the old nature is toward sin. Paul chose coveting as an example. Until the law revealed that coveting was sin, this knowledge was hidden from him and his conscience. But as soon as there was law, it pitted Paul’s old nature against the commandment of God which said not to covet. It aroused the rebellion, which until disturbed by law, lay dormant and quiescent in the flesh. If there were no law, there could be no rebellion, and therefore sin would be dead. Please keep this point in mind throughout the rest of this chapter.</p>
 <p><font color= "blue">
I was alive once without the law, but when the commandment came, sin revived and I died. (Rom 7:9)</font></p>
 <p>
At one point, Paul was unaware of God’s commandments (Rom 7:9). Being innocent, the commandments did not arouse any rebellion of the carnal nature within him. This verse is repetitious, but the lesson that law arouses sin and is the strength of sin bears much repeating. Do not ever put yourself under law in an attempt to satisfy God. The flesh can only be controlled by the spirit, never by law.</p>
Paul said that when he was under the commandment to not covet, he died. Only God’s grace brings life, not the law.</p>
<p> <font color= "blue">
And the commandment, which was to bring life, I found to bring death. (Rom 7:10)</font></p>
 <p>
God had said that the man who perfectly kept the law would live in it, or by it. In this sense, law was "to bring life" (Rom 7:10). But, no one except Jesus could keep the law perfectly. All others, no matter how hard they tried, could only live it partially. The flesh was too rebellious against the restraint imposed by law. Sin was therefore too powerful for anyone to overcome without the help of God.</p>
 <p>
Because the carnal nature is very deceitful, Paul repeated again that the effect of his attempt to keep the law was death. Paul admitted that he could not keep the law, and neither could anyone else.</p>
 <p>
In the Greek, a writer used the first person pronoun when he wanted to use himself as an example of a larger group. This is one of those examples. Paul, by saying "I," was using himself to represent all mankind. What was true of him, was also true of any other person who ever lived, with the exception of Jesus Christ. Paul said that he, as well as all others, were completely impotent to obey the law.</p>
 <p><font color= "blue">
For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me. (Rom 7:11)</font>
 </p>
First, Paul said that sin deceived him (Rom 7:11). By using the first person pronoun, that meant that all men were also deceived by sin. Paul thought his attempts to keep the law by the power of the flesh were pleasing to God, but he discovered that sin had deceived him.</p>
 <p>
People today are still deceived into thinking they are keeping the law by their own strength. They say, "Well, I am doing the best I can, and I am sure God will accept that."  They may be sure, but they are also mistaken. God accepts only the work of Jesus Christ for the salvation of all men. For anyone to retain the salvation God has bestowed, it must be on the basis of faith, not morality, or law works as Paul called it.</p>
 <p>
Second, Paul said that sin slew him. Paul was not only deceived by sin, but he realised how dead he really was when he met Jesus on the road to Damascus. Paul never again espoused keeping the law as a means for salvation. He had met his salvation face to face and there was no longer any doubt about the part sin played in deceiving and killing him. His religion had fooled him into elevating law to a place God never intended.</p>
