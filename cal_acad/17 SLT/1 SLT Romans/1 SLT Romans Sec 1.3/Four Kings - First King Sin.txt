Sin
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Therefore, just as through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned— (For until the law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law. Nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who had not sinned according to the likeness of the transgression of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come. But the free gift is not like the offence. For if by the one man’s offence many died, much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many. And the gift is not like that which came through the one who sinned. For the judgement which came from one offence resulted in condemnation, but the free gift which came from many offences resulted in justification. For if by the one man’s offence death reigned through the one, much more those who receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ.)
Therefore, as through one man’s offence judgement came to all men, resulting in condemnation, even so through one Man’s righteous act the free gift came to all men, resulting in justification of life. For as by one man’s disobedience many were made sinners, so also by one Man’s obedience many will be made righteous.
Moreover the law entered that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace abounded much more, so that as sin reigned in death, even so grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. (Rom 5:12-21)</font></p>
<p>
Adam was the head of a fallen race; Christ became the head of a redeemed race. Adam's one act of sin brought ruin on his race; Christ's one obedience brought blessing on all that are His. Death was the result of Adam's sin; Eternal life is the fruit of Christ's death.</p>

"Until the law, sin was in the world: but sin it not imputed where there is no law." (Rom 5:13-17)</font> The law made sin transgression, and charges specific acts on the person, but sin and death are plainly seen from Adam to Moses, even where there was no law to sin against,-no transgression.</p>
<h3>
Grace
</h3>
<p>
But if the offence brought death, the grace of God in Christ, brings life.<font color= "blue"> "But the free gift is not like the offence. For if by the one man’s offence many died, much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abounded to many." (Rom 5:15)</font> The judgement was of one to condemnation, but the act of favour, or grace, called "the free gift," is of many offences to justification. </p>
<p>
Rom 5:18 connects with Rom 5:12. So then as it was by one offence towards all men to condemnation, so by one righteousness towards all men for justification of life. All connected with Adam were involved in his ruined condition; and all connected with Christ, constituted those associated with Him, righteous, and puts them in that state and condition before God.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Moreover the law entered that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace abounded much more," (Rom 5:20)</font> So as sin has reigned to death, so does grace reign through righteousness to eternal life by Jesus Christ, our Lord.</p>
<p>
Grace reigns. God's righteousness without Christ's death, would have condemned us, but Jesus Christ, our Lord, has died and risen again, and we have died with Him. We are made the righteousness of God in Him. We believe on Him, and share His victory. We shall reign in life by Him.</p>
