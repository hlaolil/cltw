<h1>
Four Kings - Third King Jesus
</h1>
<h3>
How Does Jesus Christ Show He Is King?
</h3>
<p>
While many of us could give a good answer, perhaps not many of us would include the profound and powerful testimony of Scripture to Christ as King in His humiliation. This is the period described in the Apostles' Creed: He "suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead and buried; He descended into hell." Thinking through this time of earthly humiliation for Jesus, we might wonder whether His Kingship was evident at all.</p>
<p>
In the Old Testament's prophetic descriptions of the coming Messiah, we see that a number of these refer to His Kingship immediately alongside His suffering:  Jesus' sufferings (Psa 22:1-24) side by side with his Kingship (v.27-31).  refers to the entry into heavenly glory of the ascended King, who has conquered triumphantly (Psa 24:7-10). Psa 110 also refers to Christ's conquest as the Priest-King. The prophet Isaiah, in the suffering servant songs, speaks of Christ the suffering servant who is also the Redeemer-King. We see that <font color= "blue">"it pleased the Lord to bruise Him; He has put Him to grief." (Isa 53:10),</font> <font color= "blue">"Therefore I will divide Him a portion with the great, ... Because He poured out His soul unto death," in accomplishing redemptive victory.  (Isa 53:12)</font></p>
<p>
Turning to the gospels, it is clear from the beginning that Jesus is the long promised Messiah King, the Redeemer King. Matthew opens with a genealogy of patriarchal and royal lineage, and then shows the prophecies of the coming King fulfilled: <font color= "blue">"But you, Bethlehem, ... for out of you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel." (Matt 2:6)</font> Throughout His earthly ministry in the gospels, Jesus displays His Kingship in His authority and power over all creation, in His authoritative word, declared in grace and warning, in His sovereign saving work, and in His judgements and justice.</p>
<h3>
Jerusalem 
</h3>
<p>
But His kingship is also clear as He heads up to Jerusalem, into His sufferings to death. Jesus is kingly in His purpose as He does so. He is fully intentional in His direction. As Matthew recounts <font color= "blue">"Now Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples aside on the road and said to them, <font color= "blue">“Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes; and they will condemn Him to death, and deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock and to scourge and to crucify. And the third day He will rise again" (Matt 20:17-19)</font></font> As they went along their way the two blind men along the road cried out to Jesus as King, <font color= "blue">"Have mercy on us, O Lord, Son of David!" (Matt 20:30)</font> He displays His divinity and kingly power as He touches them and they receive their sight and follow Him.</p>
<p>
There is the triumphal entry into Jerusalem: <font color= "blue">"your king is coming to you, lowly, and sitting on a donkey, a colt, the foal of a donkey." (Matt 21:5)</font> 
Now preaching and teaching again within the temple, Jesus warns of the day He will return in glory and judgement: <font color= "blue">"they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they will gather together His elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other." (Matt 24:31-32)</font> This was spoken with the cross before Him.</p>
<p>
Through the last supper we see Jesus as King protecting and preserving His people. After the meal, Jesus intentionally goes to Gethsemane, knowing that this is where He will easily be arrested by Judas and the soldiers. In each case it is Jesus who is leading, his Kingship shining through his actions. Seeing Judas and the crowd come to arrest him approaching, <font color= "blue">"Jesus therefore, knowing all things that would come upon Him, went forward and said to them, “Whom are you seeking?” They answered Him, “Jesus of Nazareth." Jesus said to them, “I am He.” And Judas, who betrayed Him, also stood with them. Now when He said to them, “I am He,” they drew back and fell to the ground. (John 18:4-11) </font> The Covenant name of God, was in itself a display of divine sovereignty. As Christ, the King of all creation responds, the soldiers, for a moment encounter His glory and majesty, and fall to the ground. (John 18:4-6)</p>
<p>
There are other indicators that reveal Christ as King here as well: Jesus tells them that He is coming willingly.<font color= "blue"> Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the high priest’s servant, and cut off his right ear. The servant’s name was Malchus.
So Jesus said to Peter, “Put your sword into the sheath. Shall I not drink the cup which My Father has given Me?" (John 18:10-11)</font></p>
<h1>
Jesus and Pilate
</h1>
<p>
Jesus kingship is revealed in his encounters with Pilate and through the ensuing mockery by the soldiers. These occasions display the wickedness of the human heart and the spite of Satan as they seek to disparage the very kingship that is being confirmed through His sufferings to death. Pilate, the leading regional Roman authority, declares "Behold your King!" The crowds would rather have personal pursuit of sin, under the rule of sinful men, than the kingship of Christ. "We have no king but Caesar." Pilate who continued to publicly proclaim Him king, <font color= "blue">"wrote a title and put it on the cross. And the writing was: "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews." (John 19:19)</font></p>
<h3>
On the Cross
</h3>
<p>
Christ's kingship is also revealed throughout His cross sufferings. Christ's "office of king" includes His sovereign work of saving people from their sin (from regeneration to glorification), and His preservation and protection of them. Even from the cross, in the depth of His suffering as the Lamb who is being slain, He is the Lion of the Tribe of Judah, exercising His kingship. In the courtyard, He preserves Peter from self-destruction in deceit with a look that breaks His heart, and profoundly convicts Him and brings Him to repentance. From the cross He protects and cares for Mary as He calls on John to care for her. He saves the thief on the cross, preserves him spiritually through his sufferings--which still include having his legs broken in order to make him die. Jesus preserves him bringing him safely to be with Him in paradise that very day. Commentator William Perkins sees this is a powerful display of the virtue and power of Christ's death, and a sign of His glorious kingship, even in the midst of His humiliation and suffering.</p>
<p>
In pursuing the suffering to death, bearing the full weight of the penalty of the sin of His people, Christ actively accomplishes His work as the Redeemer-King. When He satisfied the full measure of the wrath of God against their sin on the cross, <font color= "blue"></font>"He said, “It is finished!” And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit." (John 19:30)</font> The curtain temple is torn in two, the earth shakes. "The power of the Lord who was dying and the extraordinary wonder of His death" was displayed. Dead believers are raised in the city---a sign of Jesus' kingly power even in His death: "Christ by His death upon the cross vanquished death and the grave; the raising of these saints testified that He is the resurrection and the life. <font color= "blue">"So when the centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God, saying, “Certainly this was a righteous Man!” (Luke 23:47)</font></p>
<h3>
Jesus Before Resurrection
</h3>
<p>
Even the burial is noble: Jesus' body is buried by Jewish nobles (Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimethea), with humble, quiet dignity, at great cost, in a never-used tomb of the City of David.</p>
<p>
Some churches, through a misreading of 1 Peter 3:18-19 in conjunction with a misinterpretation of the Apostles' Creed, argue that Jesus descended into hell after His death. A more scriptural understanding stands in harmony with Jesus' statement to the thief on the cross: <font color= "blue">"today you will be with Me in paradise," (Luke 23:43)</font> and His statement <font color= "blue">"Father into your hands I commit my spirit." (Luke 23:46)</font> Jesus, as the Redeemer-King, experienced separation of body and soul just as we do. </p>
<p>
Yet upon death, rather than descending to hell, His soul entered heavenly glory. He experienced what we call "the intermediate state" prior to His resurrection. The phrase "He descended into hell" summarises His suffering unto death itself, including the burial of His body, and its remaining in the state of death until the third day. The reference to hell particularly includes His bearing of the full weight of the Father's wrath and penalty for the sin of His people. This is hell: experiencing the full weight of the active wrath of God against sin, while being separated from His love, grace, and mercy. That is the descent, the ultimate humiliation, that Jesus made for His people.</p>
<h3>
Jesus After Resurrection
</h3>
<p>
In accomplishing our redemption, Christ, the Redeemer-King, gains victory over Satan. Satan's scheme to stop Christ was utterly undone, as was gloriously displayed in the resurrection. In paying the penalty that sin deserves from God, Christ the King delivered His people from the kingdom of this world. He delivered them from Satan's rule--from the charge and claim Satan can lay against the people of God, as "the accuser." Satan's power to subjugate humanity comes from the guilt of their sin; Christ broke the devil's power precisely by making satisfaction to divine justice. The place of payment is the place of triumph. From atonement arose the power to set the captives free. The sufferings of Christ "abolish the kingdom of sin and Satan, and establish His own kingdom throughout the whole world." Christ is the perfect Redeemer-King.</p>
<p>
The New Testament epistles further reveal the reality and significance of Christ's kingship in His sufferings and death telling us,<font color= "blue"> "And you, who once were alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works, yet now He has reconciled in the body of His flesh through death, to present you holy, and blameless, and above reproach in His sight—". (Col 1:21-22)</font>
Through His victorious cross work, Christ <font color= "blue">"... "having forgiven you all trespasses, having wiped out the handwriting of requirements that was against us, which was contrary to us. And He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross. Having disarmed principalities and powers, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in it." (Col 2:13-15)</font></p>
<h3>
Jesus Our Saviour and King
</h3>
<p>
Understanding Christ's kingship in suffering, through death itself, to complete victory brings us to these verses: <font color= "blue">"Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has prevailed to open the scroll and to loose its seven seals. ... stood a Lamb as though it had been slain, ..." "You are worthy ...,... for you were slain, and have redeemed us to God by Your blood Out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation," (Rev 5:5-9)</font> If He was faithful as king through suffering and death, we have every reason to be assured that He is the faithful and good king now: <font color= "blue">"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever." (Heb 13:8)</font></p>
<p>
Christ's kingship in His sufferings and death, and burial should deepen our faith, our trust in Him, as our Saviour and King. He has shown Himself powerful and willing to deal with our sin and its penalty; He has conquered sin and Satan, and in dying for us, has removed the sting of death. It should comfort us to see His kingly sovereignty and grace displayed even in the deepest intensity of His suffering. It should comfort us knowing that as the Captain of our Salvation (Heb 2:10) He has gone before us, making the way for our salvation. He is victorious. He has gone through the hostility and persecution of this world before us. He has gone through, borne the holy justice and wrath of the Father against our sin for us. He has led the way, and has done so for our salvation. </p>
<p>
We have a High Priest and King who can sympathise with us in all our weakness, and who will powerfully preserve us as we take up our cross to follow Him. He will bring us safely into the fullness of His kingdom; and vindicate the right in His holy justice to come. Christ's kingship in His sufferings and death, and burial should lead us to joyfully serve Him. It should also lead us to hate sin and forsake it, because it is displeasing to him. We should live with awareness of the great offence of sin against our Holy God: the eternal Son of God, Christ the King, had to suffer to death itself for our redemption.</p>
<p>
Understanding more of Christ's kingship displayed through His sufferings and death should profoundly deepen our love for Him. As His children we desire to obey His good commands, pursuing holiness by His grace to His glory. Where it would be a sheer wonder to simply become servants of Christ the King, through Him we are made sons and daughters of God: <font color= "blue">"a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvellous light; who once were not a people but are now the people of God, who had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy." (1 Peter 2:9-10)</font> Christ's kingship in His humiliation, particularly in His sufferings and death should lead us to awe, wonder, and humble worship.</p>
<p>
The eternal Son of God, the King of glory ...: <font color= "blue">"who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bond servant, and coming in the likeness of men. And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross. Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father." (Phil 2:6-11)</font></p>
