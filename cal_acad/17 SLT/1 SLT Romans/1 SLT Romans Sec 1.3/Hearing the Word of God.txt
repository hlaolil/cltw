Faith

"So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God." (Rom 10:17) </font></p>
<p>
We all have faith in something, but what our faith is in depends on what or who we're listening to. If we listen to the world then chances are we have faith in the world's system. We will let it dictate our thoughts, our actions and even our bodies. However, if we depend on the word of God and what He has spoken to determine our present reality then we operate in an entirely different realm, the realm of victorious faith.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"But without faith it is impossible to please Him,(God) ..."</font>  so on this basis we can deduct that faith is what pleases God. The verse goes on to say, <font color= "blue">"for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him. (Heb 11:6)</font>). Believing in Jesus takes faith. In today's passage Paul tells us that faith comes through hearing the Word of God. Paul is talking about saving faith. The message of Christ is the only thing that can produces this type of faith. We must hear it, receive it, believe it and lastly confess it. <font color= "blue">"But what does it say? “The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart” (that is, the word of faith which we preach): that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved." (Rom 10:8-9).</font> This marvellous miracle happens when you humbly receive the word of God planted in you that has the power to save you (James 1:21).</p>
<h3>
Building Faith
</h3>
<p>
The Word of God is a faith builder. The more you hear it, the more encouraged in your faith you become. The word of God is likened unto a seed that is sown into our hearts. If we receive and cultivate the soil in which it is planted, the seed will yield proportionally to what was sown (Matt 13:23, Mark 4:14-20, Luke 8:11-15). This is the law of harvest, what is reaped is not a 1:1 ratio of seed to fruit. One seed will bear much fruit if the conditions are right. And the fruit will contain more seed regenerating itself. In the same way, the word of God planted in your heart will bring its abundance into your life proportionally to what has been sown. And the fruit of these blessings will regenerate into the lives of others.</p>
<p>
Planting the word of God into your heart is so important. Peter said, <font color= "blue">"His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by glory and virtue, by which have been given to us exceedingly great and precious promises, that through these you may be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust" (2 Peter 1:3-4).</font> Through Christ we have great and precious promises but these come through the knowledge of him who has called us. If we don't know what these promises are then we will never escape the corruption in the world. Paul told Timothy,<font color= "blue"> "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work" (2 Tim 3:16-17).</font> The word of God equips us for this life. It is the breath of God and it is everything we need to live. Jesus said, <font color= "blue">"The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life." (John 6:63).</font> Above all else, we need the word of God planted in our hearts otherwise we will not grow in faith, because faith comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God (Rom 10:17).</p>
<h3>
Hearing and Reading the Word
</h3>
<p>
Are you listening to the world as your basis for living? Or, are you listening to God? Faith comes by hearing and if you are only hearing the negativity of the news then that's the faith you will have. If you're only taking in the chaos on the television, set then you will have disorder in your life. The seed determines the crop not the soil. If you don't like what's growing in your garden, then plant something else.<font color= "blue"> "The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control" (Gal 5:22-23).</font> These fruits come by planting the word of God in your heart and letting it grow.</p>
<p>
Reading the Bible and hearing the Word is a wonderful adventure. It is my prayer that you take these seeds of life and starting planting them. Meditate on today's verse until God makes it alive in your heart.  When you do you will see your crops grow, first the blade, then the head, then the full grain in the head then you will know that the harvest has come. (Mark 4:28-29). </p>
