<h3>
The Futility of Walking In the Flesh 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, nor indeed can be. So then, those who are in the flesh cannot please God. (Rom 8:5-8)</font></p>
<p>
The futility of walking according to the flesh is spelled out in these verses. The conclusion to Paul’s argument, developed in Rom 8:5-8, is stated in verse 8:</p>
<h3>
Being Set On the Flesh Cannot Please God.
</h3>
<p>
The basis for this conclusion is developed in Rom 8:5-7. Here, Paul gives us three reasons why it is impossible for those in the flesh to please God. Let us consider each of these reasons:</p>
<p><font size="+1">
First</font></p>
<p>
Those who are “according to the flesh” have their minds set on the flesh. They have a one-track mind. They are like an AM radio which can receive only signals on this band. FM signals are not received and cannot be. The spiritual dimension of life—that unseen realm which is only grasped by the enablement of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor 2:6-16) and which can only be believed by faith (Heb 11:1)—is only perceived by those who are in the realm of the Spirit, by faith in Jesus Christ. Those who are “according to the Spirit” have their minds tuned to the things of God and to His Spirit.</p>
<p>
If a Christian is walking “according to the flesh,” his mind will not be on spiritual things but only on earthly things. When Peter rebuked our Lord for speaking of His death on the cross, our Lord rebuked him for having his mind set on the flesh:<br>
<font color= "blue">“Get behind Me, Satan! For you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men” (Mark 8:33).</font><br>
Jesus' words here also make it evident that Peter’s fleshly mindset was a reflection of Satan’s views and values.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Second</font></p>
<p>
In Rom 8:6 Paul gives the reason why those who are in the flesh cannot please God. “For the mind set on the flesh is death, while the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace.” It took me a long time to take the verb is seriously. Elsewhere Paul tells us that sin leads to death, and righteousness leads to life. Here Paul says that the mind set on the flesh is death. There is a significant difference between that which leads to death and that which is, in and of itself, death. God’s wrath is both present (Rom 1:18) and future (Rom 2:5). God’s salvation likewise has a past, present and a future dimension (Rom 5:1-11). So too death is both present and future. Death is much more than physical death. Death is separation from God. The fleshly mind is so alienated from God that those whose minds are set on the flesh are dead, alienated from God, limited only to the physical world and their distorted perception of it.

Third</font></p>
<p>
Those who are in the flesh are not merely ignorant of God and unaware of His existence; they are actively hostile toward God and toward His Law (Rom 8:7). Fallen men hate God, they reject His authority, and they resist His Word:
<font color= "blue">
And you He made alive, who were dead in trespasses and sins, in which you once walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit who now works in the sons of disobedience, among whom also we all once conducted ourselves in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, just as the others. (Eph 2:1-3).</font></p>
<p>
Those who are unsaved are “in the flesh,” and as those in the flesh they serve Satan, in mind and body. They may not consciously serve Satan, but they do consciously seek to indulge their flesh, fulfilling its lusts. And in so doing, they reject God and rebel against Him.</p>
<h3>
You Can't Please or Obey God 
</h3>
<p>
No wonder it is impossible for anyone to please God by walking according to the flesh. The flesh cannot and will not comprehend the things of the Spirit. The mind set on the flesh is death. The flesh hates God and rebels against His authority and His Law. And even if unsaved men wished to do right, they could not do so.</p>
<p>
Consider these illustrations. Serving God in the flesh is like trying to manufacture sophisticated silicon computer chips in a garbage dump, rather than in a “clean room.” Pleasing God in the flesh is as impossible as trying to train a wolf to be a sheep dog. Being righteous in the power of the flesh is like trying to teach a corpse to dance. It simply cannot be done.</p>
<p>
Now we know why Paul was not able, in the flesh, to keep God’s Law, even though in his mind he agreed with it and desired to obey it. Now we know why those who would fulfil the requirement of the Law cannot do so by walking “according to the flesh.” </p>
