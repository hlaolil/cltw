Four Laws - Third Law
</h1>
<h3>
The Death of Sin
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.<br> For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit. For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace." (Rom 8:1-6)</font></p>
<p>
How is "the righteous requirement of the law fulfilled in us". <br>
The just requirement of the law is met in His curse-bearing death, is in itself accurate theology. Christ did bear the required penalty of a broken law, however, I do not think it is what Paul is meaning here by "the righteous requirement of the law". I believe he is referring to the life of loving God and neighbour that the law required. Let me explain why.</p>
<h3>
Flesh to Spirit Living
</h3>
<p>
Various signals in the immediate text point to "the righteous requirement of the law" being Spirit-filled living rather than Christ’s sin-bearing death.<br> In Christ’s death sin was condemned in order that the just requirement of the law may be fulfilled in us. Christ’s sin condemning death is not said to fulfil the just requirement of the law but was necessary for the requirement of the law to be fulfilled in us. Note, it is in us, not in Christ, that the righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled. It seems too that it is fulfilled in us because due to Christ’s sin condemning death, we are no longer living in the flesh where sin reigned but in the Spirit where sin has no authority.</p>
<p>
In a sense, this text is a compressed version of what Paul has already said in Romans 6, though the difference between the two humanities is now more clearly defined as flesh and Spirit.
Notice, the death of Christ has so dealt with sin that it no longer has dominion over us; because we are justified from sin we are no longer slaves of sin but have become slaves of righteousness<br> (we are acquitted of sin that we may be free of it).  <br>Romans 8 echoes this with its added reference to law and Spirit arising from issues introduced in Romans 7. But more about Romans 7 connection shortly.</p>
<p>
Firstly, let me back up my contention that the reference in Rom 8:4 is to fulfilling the righteousness of the Law in our lives by citing similar reasoning from other Scriptures. Romans 13 is a strong parallel.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Owe no one anything except to love one another, for he who loves another has fulfilled the law. For the commandments, “You shall not commit adultery,” “You shall not murder,” “You shall not steal,” “You shall not bear false witness,” “You shall not covet,” and if there is any other commandment, are all summed up in this saying, namely, “You shall love your neighbour as yourself.” Love does no harm to a neighbour; therefore love is the fulfilment of the law. (Rom 13:8-10)</font><br>
The parallel is not exact, love, not the Spirit, is the subject. However, this love is only possible through life in the Spirit.<br> Galatians makes a similar point with a more explicit context of two states of humanity, flesh and Spirit, as in Romans 8.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
For you, brethren, have been called to liberty; only do not use liberty as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this: “You shall love your neighbour as yourself.” But if you bite and devour one another, beware lest you be consumed by one another! (Gal 5:13-16)</font><br>
These parallel texts,and others (James 2:8), demonstrate that the fulfilling of the law in the life of the believer by the Spirit In Romans 8, is a reasonable, even probable, interpretation of "that the righteous requirement of the law may be fulfilled in us who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit".</p>
<h3>
Living Under Grace and In the Spirit
</h3>
<p>
Finally, a comment on the more immediate surroundings to this text from which the issues of Rom 8:1-4 immediately flow.</p>
<p>
In Romans 7, Paul demonstrated that being "under law" is a fruitless marriage in terms of righteous living. The reason being, the law addresses man in the flesh and makes demands that the flesh (powerless as it is) cannot meet.  Thus the law can only produce death. <br>A new marriage is required, a marriage to Christ, that places us "under grace" (Rom 6:14,15) and "in the Spirit" (Rom 7:6), if we are to produce fruit for God (Rom 6:22;7:4).  <br>This change of marriage partners is only possible through death, our death with Christ upon the cross (Rom 7:1-6). <br>The fruit to God the law demanded, ironically can only be realised if we are no longer under law. In a word, we must be delivered from the law before we can fulfil the law.</p>
<p>
Against this background we read into Rom 8:1, "For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death". The "law of sin and death" is probably not a reference to the Mosaic Covenant but to "the law/principle of sin that dwells in our members" (Rom 7:21-24).<br> Be that as it may, the principal point is that the hopeless slavery to sin and death to which the flesh is captive, is broken by "the law/principle of Spirit of life".
In chapter 7, there is only wretchedness, not simply because of the guilt of sin but because of powerlessness in the face of it (Rom 7:18-24).<br> Paul finds hope that this slavery to sin and death is broken through Jesus Christ our Lord (Rom 7:25).</p>
<p>
How? Jesus death in the flesh to sin has dealt with sin and freed us from the flesh  (in His death we died to sin and to the flesh) so that the righteousness the law required will be fulfilled in us as we walk according to the Spirit.<br> Believers do not stand impotent and wretched before the requirement of righteousness, rather, by the Spirit, righteous living becomes the air that they breathe. They are slaves of righteousness. The kingdom of God is not for them food and drink but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit <br>(Rom 14:17. Cf. 2 Cor 3:7-11). <br> Of course, this righteous living that the law demanded is realised not according to the letter of the old code but to its spirit, to its eschatological fulfilment in a New Covenant, in Christ.</p>
