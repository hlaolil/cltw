Justified
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
I tell you, this man went down to his house justified, rather than the other; (Luke 18:14)</font></p>
<p>
Jesus did not say that this man’s prayer was answered, but that he went home “justified.” Thus, the parable is about justification – being declared righteous by God. How to be justified to God is an extremely important concept and we need to get it right. Martin Luther wrote that justification “is the chief article from which all our other doctrines have flowed.” John Calvin called it “the very hinge and pillar of Christianity.” So what made the Pharisee, an example of good behaviour in Jewish culture, not right with God, but the tax collector, a symbol of dishonesty and oppression, right with God? Let’s look at what they did.
<h3>
The Pharisee's Self-righteous Prayer 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, "God, I thank You that I am not like other men—extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector. I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I possess.” <br>(Luke 18:11-12)</font><p>
<p>
On the surface, it may seem that the Pharisee had the right attitude.<br> He thanked God and mentioned that he had fasted and gave tithes of all that he received. What was wrong with this? There are at least two things I would like to point out about the Pharisee’s prayer that show he was not right with God:</p>
<p><font size="+1">
1. The Pharisee Trusted in His Own Righteousness</font></p>
<p>
The Pharisee’s prayer was self-righteous. He was not really praying to God as much as he was telling God about himself, as if God needed to know that. <br>He might have been really praying to himself, not to God. The Pharisee’s prayer could have been acceptable if he were thanking God for protecting him from situations that would lead him to become a thief, an unjust man or an adulterer, but he did not do that. He saw his not having succumbed to those sins as his own doing. There was no thanks for what God had done but rather a list of what he had done. He mentioned “I” five times in this prayer – I am not like this person, I did this and I did that. Rather than thanking God for what God had done for him, the Pharisee bragged to God about who he was and what he had done.</p>
<p>
In fact, this Pharisee believed he had done more than God required. <br>He had not only kept the law and did not need to ask for God’s forgiveness, he had also fasted twice a week and tithed everything he received.<br> He went beyond the requirement of God’s law and tithed of all that he made.<br> He might have well said to God, “Look at me! Look at what I have done.”<br> This is dangerous and wrong!</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
There is a generation that is pure in its own eyes, yet is not washed from its filthiness. (Prov 30:12)</font></p>
<p>
The Pharisee’s self-righteousness was really self-delusion. He had self-esteem but not much God-esteem. It does not matter what we think of ourselves, but what God says about us. Scripture tells us that even on our best day, our good deeds are nothing more than dirty garments. We must have a proper view of our sinfulness, our standing with God, if we are to ever approach the throne of grace.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
2. The Pharisee Looked for Validation</font></p>
<p>
The second indicator that the Pharisee was not right with God was that he thanked God that he was not like others. He compared his righteousness with that of others, even the tax collector nearby. What is wrong with that?<br> What is wrong with looking at others and saying, “Well, at least am not like that person?” The problem is that you are looking at the wrong person. <br>It is like one piece of dirty garment comparing itself to another piece of dirty garment, when in fact they are both soiled. It is the pot calling the kettle black. We are not to look down at others thinking we are better because we do not do the exact same sins as they do. You and I are just as sinful as the next person.</p>
<p>
The only person to whom we ought to compare our righteousness is Jesus Christ. Now, I know someone will say, “Didn’t Paul tell others to look at him?” Yes, he did. But who was Paul modelling? Jesus Christ! If you look at other people to form a judgement about how good you are or how right you are before God, you are missing the mark. The standard you need to compare yourself is God’s Word and the Person you ought to compare yourself is Jesus Christ. Beware lest you read this parable and produce a sigh of relief, saying to yourself, “Thank, God, I am not like that Pharisee.” The moment you do that, you become the Pharisee.</p>
<h3>
The Tax Collector’s Prayer of Humility
</h3>
<p>
Jesus' audience at that time would have seen the Pharisee as someone to aspire to and the tax collector as someone they should not be like. <br>Jesus gave a surprise ending, though. He said the tax collector left the temple that day “justified,” being declared right before God.<br> What did he do differently from the Pharisee that made him right before God? <br>We see it in his short but very profound prayer:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
And the tax collector, standing afar off, would not so much as raise his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, "God, be merciful to me a sinner!” <br>(Luke 18:13)</font>
</p>
<p>
In what might be the shortest prayer in the Bible, we see that the tax collector did three things that made him right with God.</p>
<p>
He Humbled Himself before God</p>
<p>
He Acknowledged His Sin</p>
<p>
He Asked for Forgiveness</p>
<p><font size="+1">
1. The Tax Collector Humbled Himself before God</font></p>
<p>
To be right with God we must first humble ourselves before Him. We must never arrogantly presume that we have arrived, that we are better than anyone else, or that we deserve God’s goodness. The tax collector stood at a distance indicating that he sensed a personal unworthiness to stand close to the sanctuary. He would not even look up to heaven. He felt unworthy to be in the presence of God. He was right! God is a holy God and cannot be in the presence of sinful humanity. I do not grasp this fully, but I believe it. We are separated by a great chasm of sin that rises with a stench so offending to God that He cannot even be in our presence. If we are to approach the throne of grace of our holy God, we must put aside any sign of pride or accomplishment and humble ourselves.
<p><font size="+1">
2. The Tax Collector Acknowledged His Sin</font></p>
<p>
The second thing the tax collector did was he acknowledged his sin. <br>When Job came into the presence of God, though he was an upright man, he said, “I am unworthy. How can I reply to you?” <br>When the prophet Isaiah saw God seated high and exalted, he said, “Woe to me. I am ruined. For I am a man of unclean lips.” <br>After Peter recognised the miracle Jesus performed in catching fish, he said,<br> “Go away from me Lord. I am a sinful man.” <br>Though he was the greatest missionary of the early church and wrote most of the New Testament, Paul called himself the greatest of all sinners.<br> Each of these godly men confessed their sin and knew they were unworthy. <br>So did the tax collector. He was so aware of his sin that he referred to himself not merely as a sinner, but literally as “the sinner.”</p>
<p>
This is extremely important. There are preachers out there who do not preach the judgement of God or man’s sinfulness. To them, people are basically good and just need a little help from God. You need to watch out for that preaching because it is a false gospel that does not tell the whole truth of God’s Word. <br>God did not send Jesus Christ to give you guidance to live a better life, and certainly not to make you prosperous. God sent Jesus Christ, Who is the Way, the Truth and the Life, the only Name by which we can be saved, to remove the penalty of sin and to give you a new life in Him. <br>We must be honest with ourselves and with God and realise like Jonathan Edwards once said, that we are “sinners in the hands of an angry God” and in need of a Saviour. The tax collector did this.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
3. The Tax Collector Asked for Forgiveness</font></p>
<p>
The third thing the tax collector did in his prayer was to ask for forgiveness.<br> He humbled himself to God, he realised he was unworthy and a sinner, and he then asked for God to have mercy on him. That is the kind of person that can come into the presence of God and leave restored and right with God. <br>God is angry and He has every right to be, but He is also loving and merciful and wants to extend that mercy to you. In order to receive it, we must humbly come to Him and and ask for it. The tax collector went home that day with a new standing with God. He had a new relationship with God because he had humbled himself, acknowledged his sin, and asked for forgiveness. He went to the source of true salvation (not himself!) and received the grace he needed. So can you!</p>
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
Do not be like the Pharisee who trusted in his own works to be righteous. <br>He looked to his good works to prove his righteousness. He trusted in his own self and not in God. To be declared righteous before God, we must put aside our pride and trust solely in the saving work of Jesus Christ. Anything less than that is worthless. The last verse of the parable summed up the attitude we must have:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted. (Luke 18:14)</font></p>
<p>
The Pharisee exalted himself. The tax collector, on the other hand, humbled himself and was declared right with God. No-one enters the kingdom of God on the basis of his own righteousness. Apart from Jesus Christ no human being is justified. It is by grace and grace alone that we can ever come into God’s presence. All of us stand guilty before Him, Pharisee and tax-collector alike.<br> The difference, however, between those two men was not that one was righteous and the other a sinner. They were both sinners. The difference was the tax-collector acknowledged it, and he repented of his sin.</p>
<p>
Will you go home today justified before God? Will you be declared right with Him? Do not look to yourself or your own accomplishments as validation for a right standing with God. Do not think that because you grew up in church, or said a simple prayer a long time ago, or have done much good that you are right with God. Look to Jesus Christ as the sole means for righteousness, for a right standing with God. We must first humble ourselves before Him.<br> We must acknowledge our sin and agree with God that we need Him. <br>Then we must ask God for mercy and forgiveness ... and He is just and faithful to forgive us our sins.</p>
<p>
This is good news. Thanks be to God</p>
