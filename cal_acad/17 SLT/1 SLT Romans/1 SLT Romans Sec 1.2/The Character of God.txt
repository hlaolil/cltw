The Character of God

<h3>
His Character Revealed
</h3>
</p>
“The world is in a mess!” Countless people around the world would agree with that statement. But why is it so? God has some answers. He used Paul to express in Rom 1 some good news and some bad news. The good news was that God has revealed His character through the good news of the Gospel message. Paul shares his appreciation for the gospel message which had led to his salvation, <font color= "blue">For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, “The just shall live by faith.” (Rom 1:16-17)</font> God in His mercy and love has made known to humans what He wants from them. The term “righteousness of God” in Rom 1:17 in its simplest definition can mean “what God wants.” The righteous are those who by faith always seek to do “what God wants.” The unrighteous don’t trust Him! Neither do they seek to do what He wants! The good news God has revealed is that He accepts all those who trust in Him by believing in the gospel of His redeeming and forgiving love. In response to His love they desire to always do what He wants, by trusting in Him for every moment of their lives.</p>
<p>
But there is another revelation to be found in the following verse. It also reveals something about the character of God. This time it is a revelation of His wrath. <font color= "blue">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, (Rom 1:18)</font>  How can God be characterised by love and also by wrath? It helps us to understand that “wrath” (<i>orgē</i> in the Greek New Testament) doesn’t mean anger out of control, as we often observe anger among humans. Rather it is His settled disposition against all that is evil. The tense of the verb confirms that. It is present continuous tense showing that this revelation of God’s wrath is an ongoing revelation. It is still being revealed. He knows how damaging sin is to the human race. That’s why He abhors it. That’s why it incurs His wrath</p>
<p>
Towards what is that wrath directed? Rom 1:18 tells us, the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men.  Instead of being godly, humans were ungodly, living in ways that did not reflect the character of God. Instead of being righteous, they were characterised by unrighteousness. They didn’t do what God wanted. But what was so heinous about that? Paul tells us, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth. If they had been godly and righteous as followers of God they would have shown forth the character of God in their human lives. But they didn’t. Instead of revealing what God was like in their character, and revealing what God wanted through the deeds, they “suppressed” the truth. </p>
<p>
This is a very strong word. It means here more than just being difficult towards people who want to live godly, righteous lives. Rather it means that God wanted to reveal Himself and His ways through human instruments but they suppressed the truth. They held it down, did not allow it to be revealed as they lived in ways opposed to God’s will and desire for humans. In the very descriptive words of AT Robertson, “Truth ... is out in the open, but wicked men, so to speak, put it in a box and sit on the lid and “hold it down in unrighteousness.” Their evil deeds conceal the open truth of God from men.” (Word Pictures in the New Testament).</p>
<h3>
Jesus Revealed the Truth
</h3>
<p>
There was a human who did in fact live the godly, righteous life that God wanted to be manifest in humans. His name was Jesus. His words and His life revealed the truth about God, <font color= "blue">And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. (John 1:14)</font> He didn’t suppress the truth; He revealed it! Just as every human is meant to do as a creature made in the image of God!</p>
<h3>
The Consequences of Suppressing the Truth
</h3>
<p>
If God’s wrath is being revealed against those who suppress the truth then who might those people be? As the writer to the Hebrews put it, rejection of God and of the truth of God has inevitable consequences, <font color= "blue">Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, counted the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing, and insulted the Spirit of grace? ... It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. (Heb 10:29,31)</font> God is never deceived. A life characterised by rebellion against God and the ongoing rejection of His will (what He wants) will not have a happy ending.</p>
<h3>
Good News and Bad News
</h3>
<p>
But praise God there are those who do repent of their rebellion against God and receive the truth in Jesus. These are seen as those who become righteous in the sight of God, for our sake <font color= "blue">He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. (2 Cor 5:21)</font> Good news for those who repent and believe in Jesus. Bad news for those who continue in their rebellion against God.</p>
