 <h1>
The Character of Man
</h1>
<h3>
Depravity
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil-mindedness; they are whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, violent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, undiscerning, untrustworthy, unloving, unforgiving, unmerciful; who, knowing the righteous judgement of God, that those who practice such things are deserving of death, not only do the same but also approve of those who practice them". <br>(Rom 1:29-32)</font></p>
<p>
We know that the heathen idolaters got what they deserved when God delivered them over to dishonourable passions, specifically, the vile, abominable sexual passions toward those of the same sex. God uses homosexuality as the prime example, or the most vile example, of immorality. He separates it from the rest of the sins that I'll be talking about. This shows just how low people can go in their behaviour and how low God can put people. But while we read these things, we always need to keep in mind that immorality is not the main evidence of total depravity.</p> 
<p>
We will see this as we go further through Romans. In naming some of the sins of immorality, Paul's intention was not to show that only immoral people are totally depraved. It was to show some of the outward manifestations of some of those who are totally depraved as part of an entire argument that goes through several chapters. So we need to always keep in mind that all immoral people are totally depraved, but not all who are totally depraved are immoral.<br> Rom 10:1-3 shows that even those who have a zeal for God, who are moral and dedicated, but who are ignorant of the righteousness of God revealed in the gospel, are totally depraved.</p>
<h3>
Immorality 
</h3>
<p>
Now let's get to the passage at hand, which is Rom 1:29-32. <br>The fact that not all totally depraved people are immoral does not minimise the heinousness of immorality. God lists these sins for a reason. <br>The antinomians (relating to the doctrine that by faith and the dispensation of grace a Christian is released from the obligation of adhering to any moral law) would like to just breeze on by these verses and just pass them off as the immorality that everyone commits, and go on to talk about other things. <br>But this list is here for our benefit. God lists these sins - these specific sins - for the good of His people. We had better take these things seriously, and we had better study them.</p>
<p>
The first thing we see in this passage are the words "being been filled with." These are important words. They show that these immoral acts are a way of life for these people. These people are characterised by these immoral acts.<br> So don't let the false preachers tell you that the list here describes everyone, including people who have been saved. This list is not describing saved people. Saved people are not characterised by such sins. This is not how saved people live. Now are saved people perfectly moral? No. None of us meet up to the standard of perfect righteousness. If we were to be judged based on our morality, we would be damned, because God demands perfection.<br> The only way we are acceptable to God is through the perfect righteousness of Jesus Christ.</p> 
<p>
Our morality plays no part in our ground of acceptance before God. <br>Having said that, it is also true that Christians are not immoral people. Christians love God's Law and desire to keep God's Law out of love and thankfulness to the God who saved us based on the atoning blood and imputed righteousness of Christ alone, our works of the law totally excluded. <br>So when we come to a passage like this, where specific sins are named, we, as God's people, hate and abhor such sin and walk in the opposite of such sin. <br>May this study be useful for us. And if anyone reading this is characterised by such sins, may God use this to show His unregenerate elect that they are in rebellion against God and are in need of a righteousness they cannot produce, and may God be pleased to cause them to believe in the gospel of salvation conditioned on the atoning blood and imputed righteousness of Christ alone.</p>
<h3>
Unrighteousness and Ungodliness of Men
</h3>
<p>
The first word used to characterise these people is unrighteousness. <br>This is the same word that was used in Rom 1:18, when it was said that God's wrath is revealed from heaven on all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. We saw that unrighteousness specifically referred to immorality.<br> So when Paul uses it here, it is as an introduction to the rest of the sins.<br> He says that they have been filled with all unrighteousness, and then he goes on to describe this unrighteousness. </p>
<p>
So the first specific sin is fornication. the Greek word is porneia, from which we get the word "pornography." fornication specifically refers to sexual immorality. </p>
<p>
The next sin is iniquity. This means mischief. Mischief is doing harm or injury to someone else.</p> 
<p>
Next is covetousness. This means greed. Greed is an unlawful desire, usually for money and riches. </p>
<p>
Next is malice. This means hatred, vengefulness, or ill will.</p>
<p> 
Next is envy. This means jealousy of the good things of others that leads to despising them. </p>
<p>
Next is murder. Murder is the unlawful killing of another human being.</p> 
<p>
Next is quarrels. This means strife or contention. </p>
<p>
Next is deceit. This means misleading by craftiness, subtlety, or guile.</p> 
<p>
Next is evil habits. The Greek word for this is related to the Greek word for malice. This speaks more of the personality. It is a personality of malignity or malevolence or malcontent. This includes an evil disposition toward authority.</p> 
<p>
Next is whisperers. Notice how the word forms change beginning with this word. Whereas before, God describes the sins these people are full of, now God calls them names. A whisperer is someone who secretly spreads rumours about someone. He is a slanderer - someone who deliberately lies about a person's character or conduct.</p> 
<p>
Next is God hater. A God hater is someone who despises God and His works.</p> 
<p>
Next is insolent. This means haughty or contentious or brutal in behaviour or language. </p>
<p>
Next is proud. This means arrogant or haughty, thinking more highly of oneself than one should.</p> 
<p>
Next is braggarts. This means boasters. They are those who tell others how much better they are than others.</p> 
<p>
Next is devisers of evil things. These are people who invent and scheme in order to do wickedness. They plan out their evil works. </p>
<p>
Next is disobedience to parents. This is self-explanatory. these are people who despise and rebel against the authority of their parents by disobeying them.</p> 
<p>
Next is without discernment. This is the same word that is translated "undiscerning" in Rom 1:21. It means without understanding, unintelligent, foolish. They cannot discern between good and evil. </p>
<p>
Next is perfidious. This means those who do not keep their word - those who are untrustworthy or treacherous. One can never trust that they will do what they say they will do.</p> 
<p>
Next is without natural affection. This means that they do not possess the affection for their family members that is natural. </p>
<p>
Next is unforgiving. This means that they are not able to be pacified after being wronged. They do not honour a truce. They continue to harbour resentment and will not forgive. They refuse to reconcile. The last word God uses to describe these people is unmerciful. This means that they do not show mercy toward others. They have no desire to help others or have compassion for others.<br> They just care about themselves.</p>
<h3>
Christians and Sins
</h3>
<p>
Now, as we went through this list, does any of this describe you as what is characteristic of your life? By "characteristic of your life," I mean, is your life, your personality, your way of living, defined by any of these things?<br> Are you filled with these things? Then you have not known the grace of God.<br> But I do not want this to put any doubt in any true Christian's mind. <br>Christians may fall into some of these sins. They may fall into the sin of being disobedient. They may fall into the sin of greed or slander or envy or resentment. But what distinguishes them from the people described in this passage is that they do not practice them as a way of life. They may fall, but they hate these sins and repent of these sins and abhor these sins.<br> Their life is not characterised by these sins. And the main difference, of course, is that their sins are paid for by the blood of Christ, and they have been made righteous by imputation. </p>
<p>
But we need to be careful not to make an excuse for sin when we say that our sins are paid for. I have heard over the past few years people who do just that. They say that the only difference between adulterers and Christians is not that Christians are not adulterers but is only that their sins are not charged to them. They say that a Christian's life can be characterised by such sins, but their sins have been forgiven, so, as they are habitually committing those sins, they are not guilty or defiled, because Christ has imputed His righteousness to them. These people do not understand the Christian life. If a professing Christian says, "Yes, I'm continuing to live in fornication with a woman to whom I'm not married, but my sins are not charged to me but have been charged to Christ," that professing Christian is an imposter. <br>Paul addresses this very thing. He asks a rhetorical question:<br><font color= "blue"> "How shall we who died to sin live any longer in it?" (Rom 6:2)</font> <br>The answer is, "We shall not live in it." And he goes on to explain the relationship between justification and one's personal walk.</p>
<h3>
Worthy of Death
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"who, knowing the righteous judgement of God, that those who practice such things are deserving of death, not only do the same but also approve of those who practice them." (Rom 1:32)</font></p>
<p>
Here, Paul says that these heathen, the ones who are practising all this lawlessness, know the righteous order of God. How can it be said that these people who have an undiscerning heart know the righteous order of God?<br> Well we saw that <font color= "blue">"what may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown it to them,"(Rom 1:19)</font>  which is the eternal power and Godhead.<br> And now we see in this verse that God has revealed something else to them. The next phrase shows what God has revealed to them: <br>"that those who practice such things are deserving of death," <br>God has shown natural, depraved man that those who practice the things mentioned above are worthy of death. They still have some conscience.</p>
