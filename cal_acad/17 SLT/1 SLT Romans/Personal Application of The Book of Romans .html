 <h1>
Personal Application of <br>The Book of Romans 
</h1>
<h3>
Paul’s Purpose of Writing 
</h3>
<p>
As with all Paul’s epistles to the churches, his purpose in writing was to proclaim the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ by teaching doctrine and edify and encourage the believers who would receive his letter. Of particular concern to Paul were those to whom this letter was written—those in Rome who were:<br> <font color= "blue">“beloved of God, called to be saints:” (Rom 1:7).</font><br> Because he himself was a Roman citizen, he had a unique passion for those in the assembly of believers in Rome. Since he had not, to this point, visited the church in Rome, this letter also served as his introduction to them.</p>
<h3>
Key Verses 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“I For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God to salvation for everyone who believes, for the Jew first and also for the Greek.” (Rom 1:16)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“What then? Are we better than they? Not at all. For we have previously charged both Jews and Greeks that they are all under sin. As it is written: "There is none righteous, no, not one; there is none who understands, none who seeks after God.” (Rom 3:9-11)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“But now the righteousness of God apart from the law is revealed, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets,” (Rom 3:21)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,” (Rom 3:23)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“But God demonstrates his own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” (Rom 5:8)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Rom 6:23)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His.”<br>(Rom 8:9)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose.” (Rom 8:28)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Rom 8:38-39)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation.” (Rom 10:9-10)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.” (Rom 12:1)</font></p>

<p><font color= "blue">
“Now I urge you, brethren, note those who cause divisions and offences, contrary to the doctrine which you learned, and avoid them.” (Rom 16:17)</font></p>
<h3>
Brief Summary 
</h3>
<p>
Paul was excited about being able to minister at last in this church, and everyone was well aware of that fact (Rom 1:8-15). The letter to the Romans was written from Corinth just prior to Paul’s trip to Jerusalem to deliver the alms that had been given for the poor there. He had intended to go to Rome and then on to Spain (Rom 15:24), but his plans were interrupted when he was arrested in Jerusalem. He would eventually go to Rome as a prisoner.<br> Phoebe, who was a member of the church at Cenchrea near Corinth (Rom 16:1), most likely carried the letter to Rome.</p>
<p>
The Book of Romans is primarily a work of doctrine and can be divided into four sections: <br>Righteousness needed,  Rom 1:18–Rom 3:20; <br>Righteousness provided, Rom 3:21–Rom 8:39; <br>Righteousness vindicated, Rom 9:1–Rom 11:36; <br>Righteousness practised, Rom 12:1–Rom 15:13.<br> The main theme of this letter is obvious of course—righteousness.</p> 
<p>
Guided by the Holy Spirit, Paul first condemns all men of their sinfulness.<br> He expresses his desire to preach the truth of God’s Word to those in Rome.<br> It was his hope to have assurance they were staying on the right path.<br> He strongly points out that he is not ashamed of the gospel (Rom 1:16), because it is the power by which everyone is saved.</p>
<p>
The Book of Romans tells us about God, who He is and what He has done. <br>It tells us of Jesus Christ, what His death accomplished. It tells us about ourselves, what we were like without Christ and who we are after trusting in Christ. Paul points out that God did not demand men have their lives straightened out before coming to Christ. While we were still sinners Christ died on a cross for our sins.</p>
<h3>
Connections 
</h3>
<p>
Paul uses several Old Testament people and events as illustrations of the glorious truths in the Book of Romans. <br>Abraham believed and righteousness was imputed to him by his faith, not by his works (Rom 4:1-5). <br>Paul refers to David who reiterated the same truth:<br> <font color= "blue">“Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered; blessed is the man to whom the Lord shall not impute sin." <br>(Rom 4:6-9)</font> <br>Paul uses Adam to explain to the Romans the doctrine of inherited sin, and he uses the story of Sarah and Isaac, the child of promise, to illustrate the principle of Christians being the children of the promise of the divine grace of God through Christ. <br>In Rom 9–11, Paul recounts the history of the nation of Israel and declares that God has not completely and finally rejected Israel (Rom 11:11-12), but has allowed them to “stumble” only until the full number of the Gentiles will be brought to salvation.</p>
<h3>
Practical Application 
</h3>
<p>
The Book of Romans makes it clear that there is nothing we can do to save ourselves. Every “good” deed we have ever done is as a filthy rag before God. So dead in our trespasses and sins are we that only the grace and mercy of God can save us. God expressed that grace and mercy by sending His Son, Jesus Christ, to die on the cross in our place. When we turn our lives over to Christ, we are no longer controlled by our sin nature, but we are controlled by the Spirit. If we make confession that Jesus is Lord, and believe that He is raised from the dead, we are saved, born again. We need to live our lives offered to God as a living sacrifice to Him.<br> Worship of the God who saved us should be our highest desire. Perhaps the best application of Romans would be to apply Rom 1:16 and not be ashamed of the gospel. Instead, let us all be faithful in proclaiming it!</p>
