 <h1>
Everyday Application of the Gospel
</h1>
<p>
Romans 12 is a turning point in the book of Romans. In the previous chapters the main emphasis in the book was why we need a Saviour and how we can accept Him. However, this chapter begins to deal with how a Christian ought to live out his salvation. There are many practical points to daily Christian living which begin in Rom 12 and continue to the end of the book.<br>
As you study through the book of Romans, and particularly Rom 12 and following, it is important to note that salvation is through God’s grace and not our works. However, a natural result of this salvation is to live a life pleasing to God. This is exactly where Paul picks up in Rom 12:1.
<h3>
Living Sacrifice 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.”(Rom 12:1)</font><br>
Paul says that because of the information that has been presented up to this point, he proposes that it is reasonable that one would be completely sold out to God as a sacrifice to be used in whatever manner God chooses. <br>It is natural to want to thank God for your salvation by turning your life over to Him.</p>
<h3>
God’s Plan for Your Life
</h3>
<p>
There are many practical points to daily Christian living which begin in Romans 12 and continue to the end of the book.<br>
<font color= "blue">
“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.” (Rom 12:2)</font><br>
Don’t allow the world to shape you. Allow God’s Holy Spirit to control. <br>Submit your thoughts to Him and the practical outworking of that will be to follow God’s plan that He has already designed for you. Of course, there is no obligation to obey God, otherwise our salvation would still be based on works. However, in light of Rom 12: 1-11, it is reasonable (Rom 12:1) to want to know this plan of God for your life.
Thankfully, we are not left wondering what God’s plan is. Paul begins to lay out some very practical ways we can obey God’s plan in the following verses.
<h3>
Spiritual Gifts 
</h3><p>
These gifts emerge when we display a right attitude towards others.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“For I say, through the grace given to me, to everyone who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, as God has dealt to each one a measure of faith. For as we have many members in one body, but all the members do not have the same function, so we, being many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another. Having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, let us prophesy in proportion to our faith; or ministry, let us use it in our ministering; he who teaches, in teaching; he who exhorts, in exhortation; he who gives, with liberality; he who leads, with diligence; he who shows mercy, with cheerfulness.” (Rom 12:3-8)</font><br>
Paul begins a treatise on how a mature Christian should live.<br> Again, we are not obligated to live this way because our salvation does not depend on it. Yet, because of gratefulness we should want to live a Christ-like life.</p>
<p>
Understand who you are. You are not the one who saved you, Christ is. <br>Each one of us have been placed by Christ into His body of believers.<br> We work together to form a good functioning body. This is done as a whole unit of Christians in the body of Christ, but also in smaller units we call the local church. A church functions properly when its members, with different spiritual gifts, exercise those gifts in a way that honours Christ. But it starts with an attitude of humility.</p>
<p>
The illustration which Paul uses is a physical body. This is further expanded upon in 1 Cor 12. Not all body parts accomplish the same purpose; or, as he says here not all have the same office. Not everyone can be the pastor of a church. There needs to be other teachers and people who care for the music and children and widows. Some people may have the responsibility of cleaning bathrooms in a church. While it may not seem glamorous, I can promise that if that job is not done, then at some point the pastor will not be able to effectively teach. Each person doing their part makes a church function.</p>
<p>
The same is true with the spiritual gifts. Everyone in the church needs to serve using the gift(s) they have been given by the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h3>
Guiding Principles for the Christian Life 
</h3>
<p><font size="+1">
Love</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil. Cling to what is good. Be kindly affectionate to one another with brotherly love, in honour giving preference to one another;” (Rom 12:9-10 )</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">
Godly Character</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“not lagging in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord; rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation, continuing steadfastly in prayer; distributing to the needs of the saints, given to hospitality. Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep.” (Rom 12:11-15)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">
Thoughtfulness</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Be of the same mind toward one another. Do not set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Do not be wise in your own opinion. Repay no one evil for evil. Have regard for good things in the sight of all men. If it is possible, as much as depends on you, live peaceably with all men.” <br>(Rom 12:16-18)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">
Dealing With Enemies</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Beloved, do not avenge yourselves, but rather give place to wrath; for it is written, “Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,” says the Lord. Therefore “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in so doing you will heap coals of fire on his head.” Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.” (Rom 12:19-21)</font></p>
<h3>
Gateway to Christian Living
</h3>
<p>
The first part of the book is the why and how of salvation. Starting in Romans 12 and continuing through the rest of the book you read about the why and how of the Christian’s life on earth. We call that sanctification.<br>
If you are seeking to do God’s will on a practical level today then choose one of the teachings in Romans 12 and put it into use before the day is done.</p>
<p>
It should be every Christian’s desire to live actively and intentionally for Jesus.  Our conduct reflects on our Lord; and we should want to be the best representatives for Jesus we can be.  He is worthy to be worshipped.</p>
