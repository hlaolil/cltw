<h3>
Why Jacob before Esau
</h3>
<p>
The word “election” is introduced with the story of  Rebecca’s two sons, Jacob and Esau. Paul took care to say that both sons were born of <font color= "blue"> “one man, even by our father Isaac.” (Rom 9:10)</font>  This means that both Jacob and Esau were physical descendants of Abraham.  Esau was the eldest; nevertheless God elected Jacob as the one through whom would come the Saviour. Please note that the election did not elect Jacob the man to salvation, but it did elect the nation of Jacob to bring the promised Seed–Jesus Christ.  </p>
<p>
Therefore, this passage does not say that the man Jacob was eternally saved, or that the man Esau was eternally damned.  Neither does it say that every descendant of Jacob would be saved, or every descendant of Esau would be damned.  It simply tells us that God elected that Jesus would be born through Jacob’s descendants rather than Esau's, proving that God can choose whomever He wants through whom to do His will.  God proved that He was not bound by the traditions of men to choose the eldest son (and Isaac’s favourite son), but He has authority to choose whomever He wishes according to His own will.</p>
<h3>
God’s Favour
</h3>
</p>
Remembering what Paul taught in the previous section, the right application of the example of the election of Jacob is this: Being physically descended from Abraham does not automatically entitle one to God’s favour. This was a vain hope that many Jews in Paul’s day were holding onto. They believed that being a physical “son of Abraham” made them automatically right with God.  This is why John the Baptist said to the unrepentant Jews:
<font color= "blue">
Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance, and do not think to say to yourselves, 
"We have Abraham as our father." For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.  And even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. (Matt 3:8-10)</font>

God has indeed raised up children to Abraham from the living stones who are no longer strangers and foreigners, but fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God,  having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief cornerstone. (Eph. 2:19-20)

Just as God, not choosing to be bound by the traditions of men, chose Jacob over Esau through whom to bring the Saviour, He was choosing to accept Gentiles as children of Abraham.  It was not “the works of the law” done by the cultural Jew that would save, but God had chosen to save all who met His conditions of <font color= "blue">repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ (Acts 20:21).</font></p>
<h3>
He Loved Jacob but Hated Esau 
</h3>
<p>
We have come now to the oft quoted phrase, “Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated.”  This sentence deserves extra attention, lest one mistakenly see in it a great injustice on God’s part.  Paul was quoting Old Testament Scriptures, and we must visit those verses if we want to understand the context.
<font color= "blue">
“I have loved you,” says the Lord. “Yet you say, "In what way have You loved us?" Was not Esau Jacob’s brother?” Says the Lord. “ Yet Jacob I have loved; But Esau I have hated, and laid waste his mountains and his heritage for the jackals of the wilderness.” Even though Edom has said, “ We have been impoverished, but we will return and build the desolate places,” Thus says the Lord of hosts:“ They may build, but I will throw down; they shall be called the Territory of Wickedness, and the people against whom the Lord will have indignation forever.” (Mal 1:2-4)</font></p>
<p>
First, it should be clear that the Lord was speaking of two nations — Israel and Edom (Esau’s descendants). God was not speaking of the two men Jacob and Esau; both men were long dead.  Nor is God saying He chose one race for salvation and another race for damnation. However, God did choose (elect) one nation through whom to bring the Saviour into the world (this had nothing to do with personal salvation.)  In this Malachi passage, God is reminding back sliding Israel how much He has loved them and favoured them as a nation.  He sovereignly chose this nation to be used by Him to bless the whole world, and yet the nation (as a whole) had turned against Him!</p>
<p>
When God says He hated Esau (the nation), we ought to keep in mind that Jesus also taught this:
<font color= "blue">
If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple. (Luke 14:26)</font>

Did Jesus mean that we should literally walk in hatred toward our earthly family members?–No. For we are called to love both our brethren in Christ and our enemies, doing good to all.  Obviously Jesus meant that we must esteem (and fear) other people so much less than we esteem Him;  we are to love Him with all our heart, soul, mind and strength.  We cannot be the servants of God while we are trying to please men.  In this case, “hate” can mean “to love less by comparison.”  In the same way, God did not bless the nation of Esau in the same way He blessed the nation of Israel. In the Malachi passage, God was calling the nation of Israel to account–for to whom much is given, much is required.  He had blessed them exceedingly, and they had repaid Him evil for His good.</p>
<p>
It is quite true that God had punished the nation of Esau (Edom) by laying waste his mountains.  Did God do this for no reason?
We see that the nation of Edom/Esau was destroyed by God for sin. (Amos 1:11) Esau was not “hated” by God–either as a man or a nation–due to some unchangeable “election to damnation” before time began.</p>
