 <h1>
Applying the Gospel 
</h1>
<h3>
Love your enemies
</h3>
<p>
When someone does wrong to you it is human nature to want to seek revenge against them. You may think about inflicting the same pain on them which they inflicted on you. You relish a sense of satisfaction when an harmful experience comes upon the person who had originally harmed you.

So if a person wants to live a Christian life how should he treat someone who he would perceive as his enemy?</p>
<h3>
The Advice of the Apostle Paul
</h3>
<p>
Paul was all too aware that just because a person was a Christian did not mean that they did not have enemies. So in his letter to those Christians who lived in Rome (and to all believers) he wrote these words:<br>
<font color= "blue">
"Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse. Rejoice with those who rejoice, and weep with those who weep. Be of the same mind toward one another. Do not set your mind on high things, but associate with the humble. Do not be wise in your own opinion. Repay no one evil for evil. Have regard for good things in the sight of all men. If it is possible, as much as depends on you, live peaceably with all men. Beloved, do not avenge yourselves, but rather give place to wrath; for it is written, “Vengeance is Mine, I will repay,” says the Lord. Therefore “if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for by so doing you will heap coals of fire on his head.” <br>Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good." (Rom 12:14-21)</font></p>
<p>
The follower of Jesus must not be weak. It requires your character to be strong and your purpose in life clear to be able to return good when you faced with evil. It requires strength to bless others when it is obvious that they hate you.</p>
<h3>
The Christian as a Peace-maker
</h3>
<p>
As we have seen, Jesus made peace by reconciling us to God through his death. But that is not the end of the peace-making. There is a requirement on us to live at peace with others around us.<br>

"If it is possible, as much as depends on you, live peaceably with all men."<br> (Rom 12:18)<br>

Paul knew the difficulty of always being at peace, and maintaining a conciliatory attitude to all. There is the example of Jesus publicly indicting the Pharisees in the court of the temple (Matt 23). So times do occur when, as a first priority, the word of God must be defended, before bowing to the wishes of men. However, as Paul says, as far as possible we must seek to live peacefully with all men. This preservation of peace requires us to willingly self-sacrifice our own needs to maintain the greater peace. In other words, we need to make sure that we are not the source of the discord.<br>
We must be peace-makers, not just the lovers of peace. In other words, this requires us to be active and not passive in creating peace around us</p>
<h3>
Agape Love
</h3>
<p>
The secret to this strength is found a few verses earlier in Rom 12 when Paul says:<br>
<font color= "blue">"Let love be genuine."  Rom 12:9</font><br>

The original Greek word for “love” in this verse, is the word “Agape”.<br> Agape is talking of a special kind of love – a sacrificial love. It is a sacrificial love that is controlled by the intellect of the person and not merely by emotions. <br>In some cases, rather than letting our emotions control who we love, we let our intellect (our mind) give us direction as to who we love. In the case of someone who hates us, our emotions tell us to not love that person, but if we implement “agape” love our intellect (mind) tells us that we should love that person because we know that is what God wants us to do. “Agape” has a mental and moral quality to it, as we love something which may not normally love. <br>So it aims to provide the greatest good for something.</p>
<p>
The ultimate example of agape love was when God offered His son for the sins of humanity. Humanity had broken the commands of God and did not deserve the love of Him. But God showed “agape” love and sacrificed His son so that there would be a way of forgiveness for those who sought it.<br>

As a man or woman who wants to live the life of a Christian, we need to learn “agape” love, so that we apply the principles of agape love to those (our enemies) who we would not normally want to associate with.</p>
<h3>
Getting Revenge v. Blessing your Enemy
</h3>
<p>
If someone does something against you then we need to stop and think rather than taking an instant reaction which we will later regret when we have calmed down.

The natural impulse would be for a man to retaliate against your attacker or at the very least hold a grievance against him for months (or perhaps years!).

But this is what the Bible says:
<font color= "blue">
"You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbour as yourself: I am the Lord." (Lev 19:18)</font><br>

God requires that a Christian will avoid these negative attitudes within us, and replace them with positive thoughts of doing good for your tormentor.<br> He requires us to apply the principles of agape love – sacrificial love where we do good for those who do not deserve it.<br>

As Paul says, bless those who persecute you. In this case, bless means to speak well about your enemy. This doesn’t mean empty praise of your enemy, but rather seeking the best for those who might be your enemy. It also means to not unduly condemn and criticise those who come up against us.</p>
<h3>
The Greater Judge
</h3>
<p>
When we faced with provocation from a enemy, we should remember that there is a Greater Judge who sees all things. It will be His decision whether He takes vengeance on our behalf in due course. Paul tells us this in Rom 12:19.</p>
<h3>
Forgiveness
</h3>
<p>
So the message is that believers should not demean ourselves by trying to get back at their adversary. We need to forget about the lawsuit and forgive them instead.<br>

There are three good reasons for forgiveness:</p>
<p>
1. Trying to get revenge on your enemy just hurts you as much as it does them &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;as you will experiencing huge amounts of stress and bitterness.</p>
<p>
2. By forgiving your enemy and actually being kind to them. This may make &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;them feel ashamed and change their ways.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat, and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink, for so you will heap burning coals on his head, and the Lord will reward you." (Prov 25:21-22)</font></p>
<p>
3. If you take revenge, then they may take further action against you, which will &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;lead to a never ending cycle of conflict. Your forgiveness of them may stop &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the cycle and lead to reconciliation with them.</p>
<p>
<font color= "blue">
"not returning evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing, knowing that you were called to this, that you may inherit a blessing."<br> (1 Peter 3:9)</font></p>
