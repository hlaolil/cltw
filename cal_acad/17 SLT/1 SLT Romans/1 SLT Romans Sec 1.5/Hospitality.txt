distributing to the needs of the saints, given to hospitality. (Rom 12:13)</font></p>
<p>
This verse shows that Christians have a responsibility to share what God has given them in two ways:<br>

1. Financially support Christians in need. Relieve all Christians that are in want.<br>

2. Pursue opportunities to show hospitality. Not only embracing those that offer, but seeking opportunities to exercise it.</p>
<h3>
Contribute To the Needs of the Saints
</h3>
<p>
There are times when Christians face financial difficulties. There is a point where it is important for fellow believers not only to share their spiritual blessings but also their material blessings (Rom 15:27).</p>
<p>
Let him who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches. (Gal 6:6)

Now you Philippians know also that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church shared with me concerning giving and receiving but you only. (Phil 4:15)</font></p>

Command those who are rich in this present age not to be haughty, nor to trust in uncertain riches but in the living God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy. Let them do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to give, willing to share. (1 Tim 6:17-18)</font></p>
<p>
The ideas of contributing to the needs of the saints and showing hospitality are closely linked—both involve giving to those in need.</p>
<h3>
A Lost Art
</h3>
<p>
Hospitality is a lost art in Christian circles. Despite the priority it has in the Scriptures and the wonderful picture we paint of God as we do it, hospitality is largely ignored by the people of God. Yet it is one of the great privileges, obligations, and joys of every Christian. Christ has invited us to be guests at his table. The Lord, who made heaven and earth, is an excellent host who feeds and cares for this world. (See Psa 104) As disciples of Christ and subjects of the Kingdom of God we are to imitate Christ by doing the same. Our tables are to be surrounded by guests. We are to wash the feet of the saints, which is a picture of hospitality. We are to entertain strangers. </p>
<p>
Paul says we are to be given to hospitality. (Rom 12:13) The word “given” means to pursue with all our heart. Hospitality is not something we get to if we can, but it is an essential part of our love for the Church and our witness to the world.  Below are a few verses, which provide the Scriptural foundation for hospitality. I would encourage you to “eat these verses.” We begin with what God has done for us in Christ and then move on the specific commands of Scripture.  There are many other verses we could add to the list. </p>

And Jesus answered and spoke to them again by parables and said: “The kingdom of heaven is like a certain king who arranged a marriage for his son, and sent out his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding; and they were not willing to come. Again, he sent out other servants, saying, "Tell those who are invited, See, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and fatted cattle are killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding.” But they made light of it and went their ways, one to his own farm, another to his business. And the rest seized his servants, treated them spitefully, and killed them. But when the king heard about it, he was furious. And he sent out his armies, destroyed those murderers, and burned up their city. 
Then he said to his servants, "The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy. Therefore go into the highways, and as many as you find, invite to the wedding." So those servants went out into the highways and gathered together all whom they found, both bad and good. And the wedding hall was filled with guests.(Matt 22:1-10)</font></p>

The issue in hospitality is not social interaction among friends but facilitating people in ministry. We are to “seek” this opportunity to serve others; that is, take initiative in this matter. The word “seek” is a very strong Greek word—to pursue.</p>

Many people today view hospitality as an inconvenience. However, God wants us to use our resources and homes as places of support. We are to take initiative in this pursuit.</p>
