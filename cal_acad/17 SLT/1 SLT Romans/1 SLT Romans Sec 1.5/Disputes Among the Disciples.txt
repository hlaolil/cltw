Disputes Among the Disciples

<h3>
Dealing With Disagreements
</h3>
<p>
In Romans 14, Paul addresses at length a specific problem in the first-century Roman churches — namely, that people had disagreements about different customs and religious convictions. Even though Paul had never been to Rome, he had heard about the controversies.</p>
<h3>
Disputable matters
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Receive one who is weak in the faith, but not to disputes over doubtful things” (Rom 14:1)</font></p> 
Here, we learn several important things:<br>

Some Christians are weak in the faith and, as Rom 14:2 explains, they are overly restrictive.<br>
Weak-faith Christians should be accepted, not ridiculed. People grow in faith through love and acceptance, not through ostracism.<br>
Christians who think they are strong are sometimes tempted to look down on others.
Some matters are disputable. The beliefs and practices that some Christians think are important are unimportant to others.<br>
Paul then addresses the dispute in Rome: <font color= "blue">“For one believes he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats only vegetables” (Rom 14:2).</font> Why did some people avoid meat? Perhaps they were influenced by ascetic philosophies, but more likely, the concerns came from Judaism. The terms “unclean” and “clean” (Rom 14:14,20) were important in Judaism, and as we have seen, the letter to the Romans repeatedly addresses Jews and Gentiles as the most significant divisions in the church.
Some (but not all) Jews avoided meat because they could not be sure that the animals had been properly killed (see Dan 1:8). Some Gentiles may have been just as cautious.</p>
<h3>
Accepting Sin
</h3>
<p>
Let’s see how Paul dealt with this situation:<font color= "blue"> “Let not him who eats despise him who does not eat, and let not him who does not eat judge him who eats; for God has received him.” (Rom 14:3).</font> The strong-faith Christian should not belittle the weak Christian, and the weak one should not condemn the more permissive Christian.</p>
<p>
What shocking advice! Imagine that you believe it is wrong to eat meat. Paul is not only calling you “weak,” he is also telling you not to condemn people you believe are sinning! Why? Because God accepts people on the basis of faith, not on works.</p>
<p>
Paul did not mean that we should accept idolaters, fornicators, thieves and drunkards (1 Cor 5:11). The New Testament clearly tells us to avoid certain behaviours. But it doesn’t address every situation and every behaviour, and because of that, there will be differences of opinion within Christianity.</p>
<p>
For example, if we are convinced that wine is bad, we should avoid wine. But we should not call all wine-drinkers sinners, nor should we separate from them. Wine is a disputable matter, and so are days and foods. These are matters for tolerance, not division and criticism.</p>
<p>
Paul asks: <font color= "blue">“Who are you to judge another’s servant? To his own master he stands or falls”.</font> The Lord has called us to serve, not judge. If he has been so merciful as to include us, we must let him be merciful to them, too. He will manage his own servants. <font color= "blue">“Indeed, he will be made to stand, for God is able to make him stand.”  (Rom 14:4)</font></p>
<h3>
Be Fully Convinced
</h3>
<p>
Paul then addresses another difference of opinion in the Roman churches: <font color= "blue">“One person esteems one day above another; another esteems every day alike. Let each be fully convinced in his own mind” (Rom 14:5).</font></p>
<p>
In a church composed of Jews and Gentiles, what days would be considered better than others? For some, it would mean weekly Sabbaths and annual festivals; for others, it might mean superstitions about other days. Paul describes it in such a way as to cover both situations. People should act from conviction, not from fear of what others might think.</p>
<p>
Astonishing! Paul is asking fully convinced Sabbath-keepers to be tolerant of people who ignore the Sabbath. They thought that Sabbath-breakers were unbelievers, but Paul says that they should be accepted. The Sabbath-keepers thought the Sabbath was essential, but Paul is saying that it is not.</p>
<p>
And on the other side, Paul tells those who are strong in faith to respect the weak. They do not have to adopt their restrictions or let them dictate church policy, but they should accept them.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“He who observes the day, observes it to the Lord; and he who does not observe the day, to the Lord he does not observe it. He who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks; and he who does not eat, to the Lord he does not eat, and gives God thanks” (Rom 14:6).</font> Sabbath-keepers are responding to God as best they know how. So are the others. Meat-eaters and vegetarians are both trying to obey God. When we are trying to please God, we must be gracious toward one another’s doctrinal errors.</p>
<h3>
Judged by Christ
</h3>
<p>
Our lives belong to Christ: <font color= "blue">“For none of us lives to himself, and no one dies to himself. 8 For if we live, we live to the Lord; and if we die, we die to the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we are the Lord’s” (Rom 14:7-8).</font> On the day of Judgement, after we die, we will belong to Christ — but we also belong to him now, while we live. A promise of salvation on the day of Judgement does not mean that we can live selfishly in this age.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“For to this end Christ died and rose and lived again, that He might be Lord of both the dead and the living” (Rom 14:9).</font> He is our Master both now and in our future.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you show contempt for your brother? For we shall all stand before the judgement seat of Christ” (Rom 14:10).</font> God will be the judge; we are not to usurp his role. We should not say, “They are too liberal to be real Christians”; nor should we say, “They are too legalistic to be real Christians.” We should let God decide that (see Matt. 7:1). We should not even look down on another believer.</p>
<p>
Paul then quotes Isa 45:23 to show that God will judge every person: <font color= "blue">“As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to Me, and every tongue shall confess to God” (Rom 14:11).</font> And Paul concludes, <font color= "blue">“So then each of us shall give account of himself to God” (Rom 14:12).</font> Since God will judge each person, Paul exhorts,<font color= "blue"> “Therefore let us not judge one another anymore,” (Rom 14:13).</font></p>
<h3>
Avoid Offence
</h3>
<p>
Paul now speaks to the strong, to those who eat everything, and encourages them to be careful about their freedom. <font color= "blue">“but rather resolve this, not to put a stumbling block or a cause to fall in our brother’s way” (Rom 14:13).</font> We are to be considerate of their beliefs.</p.
<p>
Paul makes his own position clear:<font color= "blue"> “I know and am convinced by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself;”.</font> The Torah declared many things to be unclean, but Paul is convinced that in the Christian era, those ritual categories are obsolete. They no longer matter to God — but some people do not yet have that understanding.
<font color= "blue">“but to him who considers anything to be unclean, to him it is unclean.” (Rom 14:14)</font> If people think it wrong to eat pork, they should not eat pork, and others should not pressure them into doing it, because for them, it is wrong.</p>
<p>
“Yet if your brother is grieved because of your food, you are no longer walking in love. Do not destroy with your food the one for whom Christ died. Therefore do not let your good be spoken of as evil;” (Rom 14:15-16). 
A Christian must balance two needs: <br>
1) Do not let someone else’s conscience dictate what you do and<br> 
2) Do not let your behaviour cause them to sin.</p>
<p>
Christ calls us to be considerate of others, without letting their conscience dictate how we live. We cannot become so afraid of offending others that we conform to every sensitivity everyone has. Just because one person in our church thinks it is a sin to drink wine, does not mean that everyone else has to abstain.</p>
<p>
Paul is talking about an offence so serious that the person would be spiritually destroyed — someone who might think, “If Christianity allows that, then I don’t want Christianity.”
<font color= "blue">
“for the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. For he who serves Christ in these things[a] is acceptable to God and approved by men” (Rom 14:17-18). </font>That is, be willing to abstain, because the kingdom does not require you to exercise all your liberties. Righteousness does not require eating, nor does it require abstaining, because it comes through faith in Christ.</p>
<p>
Good behaviour does not earn us a place in God’s kingdom, for we all fall short, but it is a good reflection of what God’s reign produces — and His kingdom does not have rules about what we eat and drink.</p>
<h3>
A Plea for Peace
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Therefore let us pursue the things which make for peace and the things by which one may edify another.” (Rom 14:19).</font> We are to teach one another what is true, and try to live peaceably with one another despite our differences. With peace and mutual acceptance, people will learn the truth about foods and days.</p>
<p>
Paul then warns the strong, who have the right doctrine but the wrong attitude: <font color= "blue">“Do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All things indeed are pure, but it is evil for the man who eats with offence. It is good neither to eat meat nor drink wine nor do anything by which your brother stumbles or is offended or is made weak” (Rom 14:20-21).</font> If you are too aggressive, you will drive the weak people away from Christ, and consequently “destroy the work of God” that is being done in their lives. Paul is not dealing with minor personal preferences, but major questions of faith and apostasy.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Do you have faith? Have it to yourself before God.” (Rom 14:22).</font> Paul did not keep his own position a secret (Rom 14:20) — but he did not badger the weak to eat and drink what he did. He did not pressure people to violate their own consciences.</p>
<p>
Paul is clearly on the side of liberty, but he also sounds a warning: <font color= "blue">“Happy is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves.” (Rom 14:22).</font> In other words, make sure that your freedom in Christ does not hurt others. Yes, you may eat pork, but if you pressure a weak person to eat pork and cause that person to fall away from Christ, you have sinned.</p>
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“But he who doubts is condemned if he eats,”</font> This reveals what the problem was. It was not that vegetarians were annoyed when others ate meat — rather, vegetarians were being pressured to eat meat themselves, even when they believed it was wrong. In their minds, they thought they were disobeying Christ, and the pressure was destroying their allegiance to him.
In such a case, <font color= "blue">“because he does not eat from faith; for whatever is not from faith is sin” (Rom 14:23).</font> The problem was not in the food, but in their perception. The conscience should be obeyed — but it should also be educated.</p>
<p>
On some matters, Christians may have different beliefs, but they should not push those beliefs onto others. People should not be tricked, shamed or coerced into behavioural change — they should be taught. It all comes back to faith. We are saved by faith, not by observing or avoiding certain days and foods.</p>
