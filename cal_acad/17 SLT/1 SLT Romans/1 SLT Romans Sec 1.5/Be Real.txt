Three Commands

Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil. Cling to what is good. (Rom 12:9)</font></p>
<p>
God must really believe in us to give us three commands in one verse. As much as I have confidence in my children, I would never tell them in one breath to clean their rooms, brush their teeth, and wax the kitchen floor. I would half expect them to wax their teeth, brush their rooms, and clean the kitchen floor with toothpaste. Yet, God created us and thus knows our limitations and capabilities. He believes in us more than we do, and He expects us to carry out all three parts of Rom 12:9.
<h3>
Love Must Be Sincere
</h3>
<p>
The Greek word <i>anupokritos</i> means “without hypocrisy (pretending; playing a part).” A stereotypical example of hypocrisy is the politician who campaigns for months on a false platform. He seems completely sincere as he kisses babies and addresses the concerns of the common people, all the while charming them with his toothy grin. Inevitably, the disillusioned masses are later faced with the fact that they were deceived, and the empty promises were merely stepping stones towards power and greed. It’s tempting to look at the disingenuous politician and say, “Wow, at least I’m not like that phony.”</p>
<p>
If I was the only person remaining on the face of the planet, I would be let off the Hypocritical Hook. Unless I had a personality disorder, I could always be true to myself and God in any situation. Since there are billions of other people in the world, however, hypocrisy is going to be a temptation.</p>
<p>
I can watch my children as they learn the art of being true to oneself. The Pope could be standing in our living room, and they would still probably have temper tantrums and make some embarrassing comment about his hat. They never change who they are because they never feel the need to impress someone.</p>
<p>
If I act differently at home, at fellowship, at work, at school, etc., then I am being hypocritical. I would have to ask, “Which one of those personalities is really mine? Will the real me please step forward?” Ideally the real me would be the one who imitates our Lord. Jesus never backed down from the truth just to please people. He endured harassment, persecution, and even torture, but he stayed true to himself and to the Word of God. He never wavered on the truth of the Word just to “feel good” or to promote himself.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Since you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit[a] in sincere love of the brethren, love one another fervently with a pure heart, (1 Peter 1:22)</font></p>
<p>
The preceding verse links sincere love without hypocrisy to obedience to the Word. If we want to love our brothers sincerely and deeply from the heart, then our relationships have to be grounded in the truth of God. Sometimes this means taking a stand for what is right and pleasing God rather than men. We are always to love people, but it is not really “love” if our relationship involves compromising the Word or backing down from the truth. To our heavenly Father, having sincere love involves the other two commands of Rom 12:9. Even though others may be offended by the truth, we still need to hate what is evil and cling to what is good. The only standard of measurement for evil and good is the perfect Word of God.</p>
<h3>
Hate (Abhor) What is Evil
</h3>
<p>
How could I teach my children to hate what is evil, if they didn’t even understand what the word means? “Hate” is really a strong word, but that’s what is so significant about the use of this word in Rom 12:9. The Greek word used here means “to shudder with horror.” We use the word so casually in conversations, such as “I hate seafood,” but I have never shuddered with horror at the sight of lobster bisque.</p>
<p>
When God tells us to hate evil, He doesn’t mean that we turn a blind eye from it or fast forward through it. He wants us to purge it from our hearts, minds, and homes. If we only “dislike” something evil or shake our heads in disbelief, it is like standing still–we go nowhere and accomplish little for our Lord. When we run in the opposite direction from evil, we can then sprint toward what is good.</p>
<h3>
Cling to What is Good
</h3>
<p>
1) Cling to God.<br>
2) Cling to Jesus.<br>
3) Cling to the Word.</p>
<p>
<i>Kollao</i>, the Greek word for cling, means “to stick like glue or cement.” The world, led by the Devil, is constantly barraging us trying desperately to prevent us from sticking to the Word. 
We need to cling to God and His Word like super glue.  If we are truly clinging to the Word, nothing will separate us – not people, temptations, trials, nor any cares of this world.</p>
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
The Basic Principles:<br>

1) Don’t be a Hypocrite<br>
2) Be true to yourself and others.<br>
3) Genuinely hate evil with a visceral disgust.<br>
4) Cling to the things that are good – God, Jesus, and the Word.</p>
<p>
Notice that God is the perfect embodiment of Rom 12:9. He is so sincere in His love that He gave up His only Son for the whole world (John 3:16). God does not show favouritism (Acts 10:34) and does not change like shifting shadows (James 1:17). He tells us that <font color= "blue">“The fear of the Lord is to hate evil; pride and arrogance and the evil way and the perverse mouth I hate.” (Prov 8:13)</font> Finally, He gives us the standard of clinging:<br>

For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Rom 8:38-39)</p>
