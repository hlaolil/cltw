 <h1>
Justified – Romans 8
</h1>
<h3>
Justification by Faith
</h3>
<p>
The term for our consideration is Justified. This, as we have seen, is always associated with belief and faith. The term has become familiar– Justification by faith only. That they are in a state of justification, or justified, is true of all who believe, who exercise faith. Christian people are often troubled and confused about foreknowledge and about the calling but no Christian should ever be in trouble concerning justification, for it is the foundation of our whole position and standing with God. The first four chapters of this Epistle to the Romans are devoted to this subject of justification by faith only. The apostle introduced it in the Rom 1:17; but because of the failure of the Jews to see it, and a corresponding failure on the part of the Gentiles, he had to argue it out in detail and demonstrate it with a multiplicity of proofs in those four chapters.</p>
<p>
Justification in its essence is a legal or forensic term, a term that belongs to the realm of the Law Court. It means to declare just, and to declare righteous.<br> It is the opposite of condemnation. The Christian has moved from a state of condemnation to one of justification. <br>For this reason the Apostle says, <font color= "blue">"There is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus," (Rom 8:1)</font> <br>He is taking up again the argument he had left off at the end of Rom 5, where he had been working out some of the consequences of justification. <br>His constant emphasis concerning this is that it is something which is done by God, <font color= "blue">"Moreover whom He predestined, these He also called; whom He called, these He also justified;" (Rom 8:30)</font> <br>In other words we do not justify ourselves before God. God justifies us, and He does it–and this is the argument of the first four chapters–entirely apart from us and our works.</p> 
<p>
It is not the result of any merit that is in us. This verse states this clearly and beyond any doubt: <font color= "blue">"But to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is accounted for righteousness," (Rom 4:5)</font> <br>God justifies the ungodly; not the righteous, but the ungodly.</p>
<p>
He again argues the same point: <font color= "blue">"For when we were still without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die. But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (Rom 5:6-8)</font> <br>It is the action of God, and exclusively the action of God. This is the central argument of this Epistle. It is the declaration made by God concerning those who believe in Christ. We are justified in Christ, but through faith and belief.<br> The belief is the instrument.</p>
<h3>
Made Just and Righteous
</h3>
<p>
Let us emphasise again certain other aspects of this doctrine. Justification does not merely mean forgiveness. It includes forgiveness, but it is much bigger than forgiveness. It means in addition that God declares us to be entirely guiltless; He regards us as if we had never sinned at all. He pronounces us to be just and to be righteous. In doing so He is answering any declaration that the Law may make with respect to us. It is the judge upon the bench not merely saying that the prisoner at the Bar is forgiven, but that he pronounces him to be a just and righteous person.</p>
<p>
In justifying us God tells us that He has taken our sins and our guilt, and has imputed them to, put them to the account of, the Lord Jesus Christ and punished them in Him. He announces also that, having done that, He now puts to our account, or imputes to us, the perfect righteousness of His own dear Son. The Lord Jesus Christ obeyed the Law perfectly; He never broke it in any respect. He gave a full and a perfect satisfaction to all its demands. <br>That full obedience constitutes His righteousness. What God does is to put to our account, to put upon us, the righteousness of Jesus Christ. In declaring us to be justified, God proclaims that He now looks on us, not as we are, but as clothed with the righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
