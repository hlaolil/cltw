 <h1>
Predestination
</h1>
<h3>
The Overall Design of Our Salvation
</h3>
<p>
Many people mistakenly think that the meaning of "foreknew" is that God knew what man would decide before he did it.<br> Foreknew (see Rom 11:2; 1 Peter 1:2) is to be understood in light of the use of "know" as in Gen 18:19; Jer 1:5; Amos 3:2.<br> Ziesler says the "fore" not only shows that God's choice preceded the knowledge of it by the Christian but also shows that it was done before the world was created (see Eph 1:4; 2 Tim 1:9).</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the first born among many brethren. Moreover whom He predestined, these He also called; whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified. (Rom 8:29-30)</font><br>
Things in our lives are not happening by accident. We can easily see the thread of God's grace weaving the history of man into the history of His Son. <br>We see this undeniable design in our salvation, in Christ's sacrifice and in the experience of every saint. If one of these aspects are true of you, they all are.</p>
<p>
We should clearly note that predestination is not associated with a select few, but a great many. Instead of an uncaring God, before us is presented a most merciful and compassionate God.<br>

Notice how similar Rom 8:28-30 are to Psa 103, an Old Testament passage.<br>
<font color= "blue">
But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear Him, And His righteousness to children's children, to such who keep His covenant, and to those who remember His commandments to do them.<br> The Lord has established His throne in heaven, and His kingdom rules over all. (Psa 103:17-19).</font></p>
<h3>
Rescuing the Doctrine of Predestination
</h3>
<p>
Predestination is not associated with a select few but a great many.</p>
<p>
Predestination is focused positively on what great blessings God is bringing into the lives of people rather than some negative impulse.</p>
<p>
Predestination is part of a whole, eternal and deliberate process rather than some spontaneous decision.</p>
<p>
Predestination came at a great cost rather than from some cheap and whimsical decision.</p>
<p>
Predestination came from love rather than some cold calculation.</p>
<p>
Predestination leads to great, high and lofty purposes rather than some nihilistic (valueless, meaningless) design.</p>
<h3>
Summary
</h3>
<p>
God is working things out not just with this world in view but also in light of His eternal and good purpose. We can have full confidence in God even in times of suffering. As we ponder this eternal plan, we as God's children will be surprised to find that we have been purposely adopted. God wanted us.<br> The Lord has intervened in our lives and benefited us. </p>
<p>
Do notice, however, in the spirit of Romans 6-8, Paul notes that this confidence is only for those that persevere in their faith, to those who love and fear Him. Remember the context of this lofty teaching is to bring comfort and stronger trust in God's plan during times of suffering and distress.</p>
