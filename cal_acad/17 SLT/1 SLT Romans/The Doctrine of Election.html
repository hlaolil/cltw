<h1>
The Doctrine of Election
</h1>
 <h3>
Is Election Individual or Corporate
</h3>
<p>
Much theological debate centres around the doctrine of election. No one debates whether election is biblical, but they do debate the meaning of election.<br> I believe in what is called unconditional individual election. Those who oppose my understanding normally believe in some sort of conditional election or corporate election. Corporate election is the belief that God elects nations to take part in His plan, not individuals to salvation. So, when Rom 9 speaks of God’s election of Jacob over Esau, Paul is speaking of God’s choosing the nation of Israel to have a special place in salvation history. They will go on to interpret all of Romans 9-11 in light of this assumption.</p>
<p>
However, I don’t believe that Rom 9-11 is talking about corporate election, but individual election. Here are eleven reasons why:</p>
<p><font size="+1">
First Reason </font></p>
<p>
The whole section (Rom 9-11) is about the security of individuals. Election of nations would not make any contextual sense. Paul has just told the Roman Christians that nothing could separate them from God’s love (Rom 8:31-39). The objection that gives rise to chapters Rom 9-11 is:<br> “How do we know that these promises from God are secure considering the current (unbelieving) state of Israel. They had promises too and they don’t look too secure.”<br> Referring to corporate election would not fit the context. But if Paul were to respond by saying that it is only the elect individuals within Israel that are secure (true Israel), then this would make sense. We are secure because all elect individuals have always been secure.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Second Reason </font></p>
<p>
In the election of Jacob over Esau (Rom. 9:10-13), while having national implications, starts with individuals. We cannot miss this fact.
<p><font size="+1">
Third Reason </font></p>
<p>
Jacob was elected and Esau rejected before the twins had done anything good or bad. There is no mention of the nations having done anything good or bad. <br>If one were to say this is nations that Paul is talking about, it would seem that they are reading their theology into the text.
<p><font size="+1">
Fourth Reason </font></p>
<p>
This emphasises God’s sovereignty about choosing individuals. <br><font color= "blue">“I will have mercy on whomever I will have mercy.” (Rom 9:15).</font><br> Singular not nations.
<p><font size="+1">
Fifth Reason </font></p>
<p>
This verse also deals with individuals, not nations.<br> <font color= "blue">“So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy”. (Rom 9:16)</font><br> It is hard to see national implications at all here. It is about individual desire and effort. The acquisition of God’s mercy transcends the ability of man.
<p><font size="+1">
Sixth Reason </font></p>
<p>
Once again, speaking in the context of the hardening of Pharaoh, Paul summaries what he is trying to say using masculine singular pronouns: <font color= "blue">“Therefore He has mercy on whom He wills, and whom He wills He hardens”. (Rom. 9:18)</font><br> It would seem that if Paul was merely speaking about national or corporate election, the summary statement would change from Pharaoh to nations (plural), but the summary here emphasises the sovereignty of God’s will <i>(theleo)</i> over individuals (singular).
<p><font size="+1">
Seventh Reason </font></p>
<p>
The objection <font color= "blue">"What shall we say then? Is there unrighteousness with God? Certainly not!" (Rom 9:14)</font> makes little sense if Paul were speaking about corporate or national election.  The charge of injustice <i>(adikia)</i>, which much of the book of Romans is seeking to vindicate God of, is not only out of place, but could easily be answered if Paul was saying that the election of God is only with respect to nations and has no salvific intent.
<p><font size="+1">
Eighth Reason </font></p>
<p>
The objection in Rom 9:18 is even more out of place if Paul is not speaking about individual election. “Why does He still blame people since no one can resist His will.”  The verb <i>anthesteken</i>, “to oppose or resist,” is third person singular. The problem the objector has is that it seems unfair to individuals, not corporations of people.
<p><font size="+1">
Ninth Reason </font></p>
<p>
The rhetoric of a diatribe or apostrophe being used by Paul is very telling. <br> An apostrophe is a literary devise that is used where an imaginary objector is brought in to challenge the thesis on behalf of an audience. It is introduced with <font color= "blue">“What shall we say ...” (Rom. 9:14)</font> and <font color= "blue">“You will say to me ...” (Rom. 9:19).</font><br> It is an effective teaching tool. However, if the imaginary objector is misunderstanding Paul, the apostrophe fails to accomplish its rhetorical purpose unless Paul corrects the misunderstanding. Paul does not correct the misunderstanding, only the conclusion. If corporate election were what Paul was speaking of, the rhetoric demands that Paul steer his readers in the right direction by way of the diatribe. Paul sticks to his guns even though the teaching of individual election does most certainly give rise to such objections.
<p><font size="+1">
Tenth Reason </font></p>
<p>
He speaks about God calling the elect <font color= "blue">“even us whom He called, not of the Jews only, but also of the Gentiles. (Rom 9:24)</font> Therefore, it is hard to see national election since God calls people “out of” all nations, (from Jews), (from Gentiles).
<p><font size="+1">
Eleventh Reason </font></p>
<p>
In Paul’s specific return the the election theme in the first part of Romans 11, he illustrates those who were called (elect) out of the Jewish nation by referencing Elijah who believed he was the only one still following the Lord.<br> The response from God to Elijah’s lament is referenced by Paul where God says, <font color= "blue">“I have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.” (Rom 11:4)</font> <br>This tells us two things:<br> 
1) these are seven thousand individuals that God has kept, not a new nation. <br> 
2) These individuals are kept by God in belief as the characteristic of their &#160;&#160;&#160;“keeping” is their not bowing to Baal (i.e. they remained loyal to God).<br> 
<p><font size="+1">
Twelfth Reason </font></p>
<p>
Using the Elijah illustration in Rom 11:5, Paul argues that in the same way,<br> <font color= "blue"> at this present time there is a remnant according to the election of grace.<br>  (Rom 11:5)</font> of which he (as an individual) is a part (Rom 11:1). <br> This “keeping” in belief of individuals is according to “God’s gracious choice”.</p>
