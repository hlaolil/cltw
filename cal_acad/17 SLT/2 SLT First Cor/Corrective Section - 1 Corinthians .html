 <h1>
Corrective Section - 1 Corinthians 
</h1>
<h3>
The Wisdom of Weakness 
</h3>
<p>
The church in Corinth was beset by problems — divided into rich and poor, sophisticated and simple, the talented and the average. Some members claimed to have special knowledge that Paul did not have. They began to look down on his simple message about a man, Jesus,  who was killed by the Romans.<br> They wrote him a letter asking for more information on several topics, and Paul learned even more about the church in Corinth from people who had been there.</p>
<h3>
Greetings
</h3>
<p>
Paul’s reply is now known as 1 Corinthians. He begins, as ancient letters normally did, by saying who he was and naming the people he was writing to: <font color= "blue">“Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth,” (1 Cor 1:1-2).</font></p>
<p>
He then reminds them of who they are:<br> <font color= "blue">“to those who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all who in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:” <br>(1 Cor 1:2).</font> <br>They are called to be holy, but they are also called to be part of a larger group. That will be important later in the letter.</p>
<p>
Greek letters usually began with <i>chara</i>, greetings, but Paul modifies this to <i>charis</i> (grace) and peace (the typical Jewish greeting):<br> <font color= "blue">“Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.” <br>(1 Cor 1:3)</font></p>
<p>
Greek orators would often begin a speech by praising the audience, but Paul modifies this to praise God for what he is doing in the readers: <br><font color= "blue">“I thank my God always concerning you for the grace of God which was given to you by Christ Jesus, that you were enriched in everything by Him in all utterance and all knowledge, even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,” <br>(1 Cor 1:4-6). </font></p>
<p>
The Corinthian Christians prided themselves on their speaking and their knowledge. Paul acknowledges these as blessings from God, and as evidence in support of the gospel of Christ. He will address the misuse of these gifts later in the letter.</p>
<p>
Since God has been generous to them, he writes: <br><font color= "blue">“so that you come short in no gift, eagerly waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ, who will also confirm you to the end, that you may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord” (1 Cor 1:7-9).</font> <br>Paul here subtly reminds them to stick firmly to their original faith, rather than accepting odd new doctrines. Don’t forget that salvation depends on Christ!</p>
<h3>
A Divided Congregation
</h3>
<p>
He begins with a plea for unity: <br><font color= "blue">“Now I plead with you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgement” (1 Cor 1:10).</font> <br>Perfect agreement is pointless if it means that everyone believes the same heresy. So in this letter Paul will try to set them on the right track.</p>
<p>
Paul had heard that the congregation was divided into different groups, some claiming to follow one leader, and some another (1 Cor 1:11-12).<br> But Paul didn’t want even his own name to be an excuse for division:<br> <font color= "blue">“Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptised in the name of Paul?<br> I thank God that I baptised none of you except Crispus and Gaius, lest anyone should say that I had baptised in my own name” (1 Cor 1:13-15).</font></p>
<p>
But then Paul stops to correct himself: <font color= "blue">“(Yes, I also baptised the household of Stephanas. Besides, I do not know whether I baptised any other)” (1 Cor 1:16).</font> Paul could have edited his original mistake out, but he left it in as an illustration of how unimportant it was to keep track of who did the actual baptism.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“For Christ did not send me to baptise, but to preach the gospel, not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect” <br>(1 Cor 1:17).</font> <br>Paul baptised people — and he assumed that all the readers had been baptised — but the gospel was his priority. The message centred on Christ, not on a ritual. Paul wanted to persuade people with the facts, not with the flowery oratory that some Greek philosophers used to attract a following.</p>
<h3>
God’s Power and Wisdom
</h3>
<p>
The message about a crucified Messiah might seem preposterous to some people, but God uses that message to bring salvation to those who believe.<br> <font color= "blue">“For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God” (1 Cor 1:18).</font><br> Paul then quotes Isaiah: <font color= "blue">“For the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hidden.” (Isa 29:14)</font><br> God works in unexpected ways — some people might say that the gospel of grace is a message of weakness, but Paul says it is a message of power <br>(Rom. 1:16).</p>
<p>  
Paul asks:<font color= "blue">
“Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the disputer of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?” (1 Cor 1:20)</font>.<br> Most are not in the church. Most are not accepting the message of salvation.</p>
<p>
Humans value education, but God’s message does not depend on human approval. People cannot know God through their own intelligence, and they cannot save themselves by any amount of philosophy or study. <br>Instead, God decided to save people who believed the gospel (1 Cor 1:21).</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“For Jews request a sign, and Greeks seek after wisdom; but we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block and to the Greeks foolishness, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God” (1 Cor 1:22-24).</font> <br>The message is too simple for some people, but God uses it to save His people.</p>
<p>
The crucified Christ may look weak and foolish, but this is the power and wisdom of God. <br><font color= "blue">“Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men” (1 Cor 1:25).</font> <br>This is the basis of unity in the church: accepting the gospel of Christ crucified — people being saved by the shameful death of Christ.</p>
<h3>
The Wisdom of God
</h3>
<p>
Remember that you were ordinary people when you heard the gospel, Paul says. You were not the movers and shakers of Corinth.<br><font color= "blue"> “But God has chosen the foolish things of the world to put to shame the wise, and God has chosen the weak things of the world to put to shame the things which are mighty; and the base things of the world and the things which are despised God has chosen, and the things which are not, to bring to nothing the things that are, that no flesh should glory in His presence” (1 Cor 1:27-29).</font></p>
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
If people could save themselves through their own intelligence, then the kingdom of God would be filled with people who were proud of their own accomplishments. If people could get in through their own abilities, they would think that they were just as good as God.</p>
<p>
So God decided to call the nobodies of this world, those who were willing to admit their need, those who were willing to accept the gift of salvation.<br> And this plan will eventually shame the wise and humiliate the proud, who will then be able to realise that their own strength, no matter how good it was, was not good enough.</p>
<p>
Because of God’s plan, Paul writes:<br><font color= "blue"> “But of Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God—and righteousness and sanctification and redemption— that, as it is written, <br>“He who glories, let him glory in the Lord.” (1 Cor 1:30-31, cf Jer 9:24).</font> <br>Jesus is our righteousness — it is in Him, and only in Him, that we can be righteous and holy. Only when we are in Christ, united with Him by faith, can we be redeemed. We cannot boast about anything we did — our only boast is in what Christ does for us. He gets the credit and the praise!</p>
