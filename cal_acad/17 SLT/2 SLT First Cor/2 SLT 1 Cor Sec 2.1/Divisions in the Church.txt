Divisions in the Church

<h3>
Why Do We Have Divisions?
</h3>
<p>
What’s the problem with the church? Someone said, “The problem with the church is that it has people!” This is funny, I think. But the reality is that Christians in church inflict wounds and emotional trauma on one other. If we have been in church long enough, we experience recurrent problems of conflicts, quarrels, divisions and factions. These weaken the church, spread disunity, and displease God.</p>
<p>
Why do we have divisions in church? Surely this happens for a multitude of reasons which are all rooted in our sinful pride, along with interpersonal, racial, cultural and prejudicial blind spots. But let’s look specifically at the church at Corinth and see if we might discover the cause of divisions there, and how Paul dealt with it.
Apparently, divisions occurred in Corinth because members of the church aligned themselves with their preferred, particular leaders, including Paul, Apollos and Cephas (1 Cor 1:12). In response, Paul began to explain to them how they should view their church leaders. More fundamentally, he described who and what a church leader is.</p>
<h3>
Is the Christian Leader Above the Rest? 
</h3>
<p>
Many think of a leader as someone who is highly exalted, elevated, or elite. But Paul says, <font color= "blue">“Let a man so consider us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God” (1 Cor 4:1).</font> According to Paul, a Christian leader is a servant. Paul had already said this earlier:<font color= "blue"> “Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers through whom you believed, as the Lord gave to each one?” (1 Cor 3:5).</font></p>
<p>
But some Christians in Corinth did not view their leaders as servants. Rather, they elevated their leaders, regarding them as special. Then they formed cliques, divisions and factions based on their preferred leader. When some chose Paul as their leader, he was not flattered, but angry, and he rebuked them, saying, “One of you says, <font color= "blue">"I follow Paul"; another, "Now I say this, that each of you says, “I am of Paul,” or “I am of Apollos,” or “I am of Cephas,” or “I am of Christ.” Is Christ divided? ” (1 Cor 1:12-13)</font></p>
<h3>
Are You In or Are You Out? 
</h3>
<p>
In following their preferred leader, they failed to see Christ as the ultimate leader and head of the church (Col 1:18; Eph 1:22). Their functional leader was another human being. Then trouble began as they divided themselves among Paul, Apollos, and Cephas. Paul stressed that a Christian leader, however great, is a mere servant, not a highly exalted or special or elite person whom they should side with or boast about. When this happens, their attitude becomes “Are you with my chosen top leader Paul, or are you with your lesser leader Apollos?” In other words, “Are you in, or are you out?” Many damaging divisions in the church have arisen from this.</p>
<h3>
Jesus' Revolutionary View of Leadership
<h3>
<p> <font color= "blue">
"Jesus called them to Himself and said to them, “You know that those who are considered rulers over the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. Yet it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you shall be your servant. And whoever of you desires to be first shall be slave of all. For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many.” (Mark 10:42-45)</font></p>
<p>
In those verses, Jesus explained the difference between worldly leaders (like the Gentile rulers) and biblical or Christian leaders. Worldly leaders boss people around; Christian leaders serve others at the high cost of painful personal sacrifice. Our Lord Jesus Christ is the greatest leader, because he gave his very life in order to love and serve wretched sinners. Yet many Christian leaders throughout history have led like worldly rulers, exercising authority over others in the church. Then it becomes unclear whether Christ or the church leader is the head. It becomes unclear whether the final authority rests in the words of the Bible or in the leader’s words and opinions.</p>
<h3>
The Christian Leader’s Main Task
</h3>
<p>
The task of the Christian leader is not to rule over the church. Rather, Paul said: <font color= "blue">Let a man so consider us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God” (1 Cor 4:1).</font>  Here, Paul is saying that a Christian leader’s main work is to reveal/proclaim/declare <font color= "blue">“Jesus Christ and Him crucified” (1 Cor 2:2).</font> </p>
<p>
Why? It is because “Jesus Christ and Him crucified” is the focal point and key to all of God’s secrets and mysteries and wisdom, which is to save sinful man from eternal condemnation in hell (John 3:16; 2 Peter 3:9). This can only happen through <font color= "blue">“but to preach the gospel,” (1 Cor 1:17).</font> This is only heard from <font color= "blue">“the message of the cross” (1 Cor 1:18). Paul’s main point in all of his teaching was to <font color= "blue">“preach Christ crucified” (1 Cor 1:23).</font></p>
<p>
Because a Christian leader has been entrusted with such a great task, he must be faithful to this trust with all his heart and his life. Paul says, <font color= "blue">“Moreover it is required in stewards that one be found faithful” (1 Cor 4:2).</font> Like Paul, a servant leader does not try to control people in his church, but he is faithful to proclaiming the mysteries God had graciously entrusted to him.</p>
<h3>
Autocracy and Oligarchy. 
</h3>
<p>
John Stott wrote an excellent book on Christian leadership based on 1 Cor 1-4 titled Calling Christian Leaders: Biblical Models of Church, Gospel and Ministry. Stott spoke throughout the world for 35 years and observed many church leaders. His conclusion? “... it is my firm conviction that there is too much autocracy [or oligarchy] in the leaders of the Christian community, in defiance of the teaching of Jesus and his apostles, and not enough love and gentleness. Too many behave as if they believed not in the priesthood of all believers but in the papacy of all pastors.” (I added “oligarchy,” which is not in Stott’s quote, but which I felt expanded and clarified the nature of authoritarian church leadership that Stott observed.) Sadly, our present-day church and its leadership model is not much different from that of the troubled Corinthian church.</p>
<p>
The church in Corinth was divided because of unbiblical views of Christian leadership. Church members thought of their leaders as “super-apostles” (2 Cor 11:5; 12:11). Some criticised Paul and tried to discredit him in order to exalt their own leadership over him. They failed to honour Christ as the head of the church, and they promoted their own leadership and authority more than proclaiming the gospel. In this way, they created and perpetuated divisions.</p>
