Believers Suing Believers
</h1>
<h3>
Should Christians Sue At All?
</h3>
<p>
The application of this question presents us with some difficulties today.<br> But before we go any further, here is the text that raises our questions:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unrighteous, and not before the saints? Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world will be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters? Do you not know that we shall judge angels? <br>How much more, things that pertain to this life? If then you have judgements concerning things pertaining to this life, do you appoint those who are least esteemed by the church to judge? I say this to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you, not even one, who will be able to judge between his brethren? But brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers! Now therefore, it is already an utter failure for you that you go to law against one another. Why do you not rather accept wrong? Why do you not rather let yourselves be cheated? No, you yourselves do wrong and cheat, and you do these things to your brethren!s!” (1 Cor 6:1-8)</font></p>
<p>
We can say the Corinthian church did not have the greatest reputation.<br> We learn that they were allowing incestuous relations with one another, getting tipsy off the Lord’s Supper, they had factions, there was conflict between the rich and poor folk, and dressing in ways that may or may not make most of us television viewers blush. But another evil the Apostle Paul addresses to their shame is the way they are handling disputes among themselves.</p>
<p>
The Bible admits that there will be disputes among Christians. Here Paul is not condemning the fact that they have disputes, but how as believers they are handling them.</p>
<h3>
Jesus' Words on Disputes
</h3>
<p>
Jesus puts forward a practical system for resolving disputes among Christians.  <font color= "blue">"if your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother. But if he will not hear, take with you one or two more, that "by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established." And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church. But if he refuses even to hear the church, let him be to you like a heathen and a tax collector (Matt 18:15-17).</font></p>
<h3>
Why Did You Say That, Paul?
</h3>
<p>
There are probably many Christians and Christian lawyers who might wish that Paul had never penned these words to the Corinthians and to us. <br>I noted above that 1 Cor 6 presents us today with quite a few difficulties. <br>Christian Lawyer and Ordained Minister, John Eidsmoe, shares some of the problems.</p>
<p>
Where do you go to church? Today, we don’t have just one church in a community; we have many–not only many churches, but many denominations. Does this passage apply only to those who are members of the same church?
The real Christians please stand up. Do we apply this to disputes only between evangelicals? Or only those who clearly recognise one another as Christian?<br> Or anyone who calls himself or herself a Christian?
I know my rights. <br>The complexity of legal cases today can make it difficult for the local church to resolve a dispute that can be pretty serious.
Covered from womb to the tomb. Most people, including Christians, are insured again most types of liability.<br> What if the insurance company does not pay?
These are just a few of the difficulties, I am sure there are more. I’m no legal expert and won’t try to respond to all of these.<br> But this still leaves us with our question, how does 1 Cor 6 apply today?
<h3>
Should Christians Sue At All?
</h3>
<p>
When asked this question I have heard Christians answer differently. <br>I am of the opinion a lawsuit is a justifiable option for a Christian.<br> However, there may be situations where one is legally justified in filing a lawsuit, but a Christian must evaluate more than just the letter of the law.</p>
<p>
First, both parties should try and settle the dispute and do so outside of court. Paul says it is to the Corinthians shame and is a defeat for them already since they have not tried to resolve these trivial disputes in the church since God has given wise Christians to assist with the issue. The Christian should go through the proper channels (Matt 18) to settle the dispute rather than go to court.</p>
<p>
Second, it is only about disputes between Christians. Paul does not mean that a Christian cannot or should not go to court to obtain justice against a non-Christian. Some have debated that Paul gives no direct command not to sue another believer; he simply asks rhetorical questions for them to consider the consequences. Others see the context and language ruling out that we should sue another Christian. The principle may apply more directly to disputes between Christians in the same church, but it can certainly have a secondary application to other Christians as well. In general, Christians should seek to settle their disputes between each other and non-Christians and still try to do so outside of court.</p>
<p>
Thirdly, all sins are not crimes, but all crimes are sins. There is a difference between a sin and a crime. The church handles sins, and crimes are handled by the state. Both are God’s governing authority that he has given us for our good. In Matt 18 and 1 Cor 6, Jesus and Paul seems to be dealing with church and civil disputes between people, not criminal actions or disputes with insurance companies, class actions suits, or other kinds of legal action. <br>There are no specific criminal cases mentioned since Paul teaches in Rom 13 that they must be handled by the state. When even a Christian has committed a crime, we may be obligated to turn a fellow Christian in and even testify in court. The church has no authority over criminal cases, it belongs to the state.</p>
<p>
So should a Christian sue at all? I think yes, sometimes. <br>There may be circumstances where to seek a legal remedy is the only way to resolve a dispute. However, when it comes to church issues Christians should never go to court. And as with the Corinthians, civil matters should be handled outside of the courtroom, if at all possible.</p>
<h3>
A Word of Caution 
</h3>
<p>
It seems doubtful that Paul intended this specific example to be a “one size fits all” instruction. But whatever the circumstance, it is clear that any dispute between Christians should be handled carefully. There are far too many unnecessary lawsuits today, and many among Christians. I don’t think this should be the case. Before a Christian decides to go to court, they should consider that:</p>
<p>
Lawsuits among or by Christians can reflect negatively on the church and on your testimony and hinder the cause of Christ. It leads others to believe we cannot get along and it is “bad publicity” for the church, yourself, and the advancement of the gospel.</p>
<p>
Going to court can be financially, emotionally, and spiritually damaging. <br>The financial burden of going to court is usually overwhelming.<br> If you sue and “win,” it still costs you thousands of dollars to pay the court fees and lawyer fees. If you lose, it costs you not not only legal fees but the judgement as well. Lawsuits also take time. They can and typically do create major stress, not merely the financial and time stresses just mentioned, but also emotional and mental stress. A suing Christian can also suffer spiritual damage. It can be difficult to ensure our motives remain pure and honourable while taking another to court.</p>
<p>
Remember there are other options. The court systems actually use arbitrators and mediators to try and work out differences, and Christians should do the same. There’s mediation and arbitration Christian groups that actually do this.
Paul ends here with his fellow Christians the same way I will. He reminds them that despite their current ridiculous behaviour that is no longer who they are. They once lived to defend their own rights and to fulfil their own passions and pleasures, but have since been forgiven, set apart as God’s child, and have been declared right before God because of our Lord Jesus Christ. We too must work hard to make the reconciliation we have experienced through Jesus Christ a reality among ourselves and others who don’t believe.</p>
