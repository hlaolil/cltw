<h1>
The Basis of Eternal Judgement
</h1>
<p><dr class="alt5">
For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our King; He will save us. (Isa 33:22)</dr class="alt5"> </p>
<h3>
Introduction
</h3>
<>p 
Eternal Judgement is the last of the six foundation principles of the Christian faith. In the Old Testament the word "Judgement" is used two ways. One refers to the statutes, testimonies, and laws of God. The other concerns God's Judgement on men and nations. The latter meaning is how the word "Judgement" is used in the New Testament. It is this meaning that is used in this chapter.</p>
<h3>
Definition
</h3>
<p> 
The word "to judge" means to separate or make a difference between. This includes bringing to trial, examining evidence, determining guilt or innocence, and deciding the penalty for sin. Eternal Judgement is the great and final Judgement spoken of in the Bible which determines the eternal destiny of all souls.</p>
<h3>
The Judges 
</h3>
<p><dr class="alt5">
God is our judge, For the Lord is our judge. (Isa 33:22)<dr class="alt5"> <dr class="alt5">... God the judge of all ... (Heb 12:23)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
He judges the sinful behaviour of mankind, but God's real desire is not Judgement but that all men come to the knowledge of Jesus Christ. <dr class="alt5">For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved. (John 3:17)</dr class="alt5"> <dr class="alt5">The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some count slackness, but is long suffering toward us, not willing that any should perish but that all should come to repentance. (2 Peter 3:9)</dr class="alt5"> God's desire is that all men everywhere repent. If they do not repent of sin they will experience His Judgement.<dr class="alt5"> Truly, these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now commands all men everywhere to repent, because He has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man whom He has ordained. He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead.” (Acts 17:30-31)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
God has given the authority to judge to Jesus Christ. <dr class="alt5">For the Father judges no one, but has committed all judgement to the Son. (John 5:22)</dr class="alt5"> and has given Him authority to execute judgement also, because He is the Son of Man. (John 5:27)</p>
<p>
In the final Judgement true believers will help judge the world. <dr class="alt5"> Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world will be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters? 3 Do you not know that we shall judge angels? How much more, things that pertain to this life? (1 Cor 6:2-3)</dr class="alt5"> The title of "Lord’s people" also referred to as “Saints” in this verse means all true believers. They will help judge the "world"[the unrighteous].</p>
<h3>
The Standard of Judgement
</h3>
<p> 
The standard by which we all will be judged is the Word of God:<dr class="alt5"> if anyone hears My words and does not believe, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world. He who rejects Me, and does not receive My words, has that which judges him—the word that I have spoken will judge him in the last day. (John 12:47-48)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
It is not the standards, creeds, or traditions of man by which we will be judged. It is not on the basis of organisational or denominational rules. The standard by which we will be judged is the fixed standard of the Word of God. <dr class="alt5">Forever, O Lord, Your word is settled in heaven. (Psa 119:89)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
The Reason for Judgement
</h3>
<p> 
The Bible reveals Judgement is necessary because of sin against God's law,<dr class="alt5"> For as many as have sinned without law will also perish without law, and as many as have sinned in the law will be judged by the law (Rom 2:12)</dr class="alt5"> ungodliness, <dr class="alt5">But the heavens and the earth which are now preserved by the same word, are reserved for fire until the day of judgement and perdition of ungodly . (2 Peter 3:7)</dr class="alt5"> unrighteousness, If this is so, <dr class="alt5">then the Lord knows how to deliver the godly out of temptations and to reserve the unjust under punishment for the day of judgement, (2 Peter 2:9)</dr class="alt5"> unbelief,  <dr class="alt5">“He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. (John 3:18)</dr class="alt5"> trespasses, <dr class="alt5">Therefore, as through one man’s offence judgement came to all men, resulting in condemnation, even so through one Man’s righteous act the free gift came to all men, resulting in justification of life. (Rom 5:18)</dr class="alt5"> and evil deeds.<dr class="alt5"> And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. (John 3:19)</dr class="alt5"> Although these are different words, they are all words for sin.</p>
<h3>
The Principles of Divine Judgement
</h3>
<p> 
Worldly principles of Judgement vary from nation to nation. The standards may vary from state to state within a nation and from city to city. Worldly principles of Judgement and punishment vary because people interpret certain acts in different ways.</p>
<p>
The same act interpreted as wrong in one culture may be acceptable in another. For example, killing of a cow is viewed quite differently in America, where it is used for meat, than in India where the cow is considered sacred by some people. The Judgement of man varies because the standards by which they judge vary. But the principles of God's Judgement do not change. God judges on basis of the Word of God. <dr class="alt5">Forever, O Lord, Your word is settled in heaven. (Psa 119:89)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Men and nations will be judged according to the knowledge of God which was given them. Jesus said some would be judged more severely than the cities of Sodom, Gomorrha, Ninevah, Tyre, and Sidon. These were evil cities mentioned in the Old Testament which God judged and punished.</p>
<p>
The reason Jesus pronounced more severe Judgement on some New Testament cities was because these cities had more knowledge of God. Jesus Himself had ministered in these cities and performed mighty works of healing and deliverance. Still, the people of these cities would not repent. <dr class="alt5">“Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. But I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of Judgement than for you. And you, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades; for if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. But I say to you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of Judgement than for you.” (Matt 11:21-24)</dr class="alt5"><dr class="alt5">The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgement with this generation and condemn it, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah; and indeed a greater than Jonah is here. (Matt 12:41) </dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
A general revelation of God is given to all men through the wonders of creation, <dr class="alt5">For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse, (Rom 1:20)</dr class="alt5"> this general understanding of God given to all men through creation is the basic standard by which men will be judged. Those who receive additional revelation by hearing God's Word will be judged by a higher standard of knowledge.</p>
<h3>
Individually
</h3>
<p> 
Each person will be judged individually. <dr class="alt5">The one who sins is the one who will die. The soul who sins shall die. The son shall not bear the guilt of the father, nor the father bear the guilt of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself. (Ezek 18:20)</dr class="alt5"> Judgement determining individual eternal destiny will not be on a group basis. It will be on an individual basis according to the truth, <dr class="alt5">we know that the judgement of God is according to truth against those who practice such things.. (Rom 2:2)</dr class="alt5"> and on the basis of personal conduct. <dr class="alt5">For we must all appear before the judgement seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad. (2 Cor 5:10)</dr class="alt5"> God <dr class="alt5">“will render to each one according to his deeds” (Rom 2:6)</dr class="alt5"> <dr class="alt5">And if you call on the Father, who without partiality judges according to each one’s work, conduct yourselves throughout the time of your stay here in fear;(1 Peter 1:17)</dr class="alt5"> <dr class="alt5">And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were written in the books. (Rev 20:12)</dr class="alt5"> </p>
<p>
God's record of man's "works" covers not only actions but also thoughts and motives. <dr class="alt5">"For the Lord does not see as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.”(1 Sam 16:7).</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
The eternal Judgement will be without partiality. This means without special favour. People will not be judged on the basis of their wealth, social position, nationality, or education. <dr class="alt5">And if you call on the Father, who without partiality judges according to each one’s work, conduct yourselves throughout the time of your stay here in fear; (1 Peter 1:17)</dr class="alt5"> To have respect of persons means to be influenced in Judgement by some external factor of appearance, relationship, position, wealth, etc. God's Judgement is not influenced by any of these things. The LORD said to Samuel, “Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The LORD does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.” (1 Sam 16:7)</p>
<p>
God judges according to the law, <dr class="alt5">... as many as have sinned in the law will be judged by the law. (Rom 2:12)</dr class="alt5"> according to righteousness,<dr class="alt5"> He shall judge the world in righteousness, and He shall administer judgement for the peoples in uprightness. (Psa 9:8)<dr class="alt5"> ... He shall judge the world with righteousness, and the peoples with His truth. (Psa 96:13)</dr class="alt5"> <dr class="alt5">He has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness ... (Acts 17:31)</dr class="alt5"> ...the righteous Judgement of God. (Rom 2:5)</dr class="alt5"> <dr class="alt5">Finally, there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give to me on that Day, and not to me only but also to all who have loved His appearing. (2 Tim 4:8)</dr class="alt5"> and according to thoughts and motives, <dr class="alt5">Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and reveal the counsels of the hearts. Then each one’s praise will come from God. (1 Cor 4:5)</dr class="alt5"> <dr class="alt5">in the day when God will judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel. (Rom 2:16).</dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
The Time OF Judgement 
</h3>
<p>
The Bible indicates there is a past, present, and future Judgement.</p>
<h3>
Past Judgement
</h3> 
<p>
The Bible is a history of God's past Judgement, from the time of Adam and Eve it records God's Judgement of nations and individuals. The Bible records two special past Judgements that are important to believers. These are the Judgements of Satan and the world. God has already passed Judgement and set the penalties for both.</p>
<p>
Through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, God passed final Judgement on Satan <dr class="alt5">... because the ruler of this world [Satan] is judged. (John 16:11)</dr class="alt5"> <dr class="alt5">Having disarmed principalities and powers, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in it. (Col 2:15)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Satan has already been judged by God. He is allowed limited activity until he is cast into the lake of fire at the end of the world but he is already condemned as guilty. Satan's angels, who left their original position in Heaven as angels of God to join him in rebellion, are also already condemned:<dr class="alt5">And the angels who did not keep their proper domain, but left their own abode, He has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness for the judgement of the great day. (Jude 1:6) </dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
The World
</h3>
<p> 
Jesus said: <dr class="alt5">Now is the Judgement of this world ...(John 12:31)</dr class="alt5"> Because it is ruined by the presence of sin, the physical world is already condemned by God's Judgement. The Bible says the world will be destroyed by fire:<dr class="alt5"> But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up. (2 Peter 3:10)</dr class="alt5"></p> 
<h3>
Present Judgement
</h3>
<p> 
There is a present Judgement that goes on continuously. All men are presently judged as sinful or righteous before God. The present Judgement of man is on the basis of whether or not he has accepted Jesus Christ as Saviour: <dr class="alt5">“He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. (John 3:18)</dr class="alt5"> God's present Judgement on unbelievers is by showing His wrath because they hinder the truth:<dr class="alt5">For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,(Rom 1:18)</dr class="alt5"> God's present Judgement of believers is in love. He corrects them when they do wrong: <dr class="alt5">"My son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord, nor be discouraged when you are rebuked by Him; For whom the Lord loves He chastens, ... But if you are without chastening, of which all have become partakers, then you are illegitimate and not sons. (Heb 12:5-6,8)</dr class="alt5"> </p>
<p>
Just as a natural father corrects his children, God judges the behaviour of His children. If they sin, God corrects them in love just as a father does his son. God's chastisement [correction] of His children is for a specific purpose: <dr class="alt5">Now no chastening seems to be joyful for the present, but painful; nevertheless, afterwards it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it. (Heb 12:11)</dr class="alt5"> </p>
<h3>
Future Judgement
</h3>
<p> 
It is the future Judgement to which Paul refers in Hebrews 6 when he speaks of "eternal Judgement.” Eternal Judgement happens after death: <dr class="alt5">It is appointed for men to die once, but after this the Judgement.(Heb 9:27)</dr class="alt5"> </p>
<p>
After a person dies it is immediately determined whether or not he enters the presence of God. The destinies of the righteous and the unrighteous are different after death. But the final Judgement confirming their eternal destinies occurs after the end of the world and the resurrection: I charge you therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead at His appearing and His kingdom:(2 Tim 4:1)  <dr class="alt5">... “Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement on all, ...(Jude 1:14-15)</dr class="alt5"> </p>
<h2>
The Locations of Final Judgement 
</h2>
<p>
There are three locations where final Judgement will occur:</p>
<h3>
The Judgement Seat of Christ
</h3>
Those judged here will be all true believers: <dr class="alt5">... We shall all stand before the Judgement seat of Christ. (Rom 14:10)<dr class="alt5"> <dr class="alt5">... For we must all appear before the Judgement seat of Christ.(2 Cor 5:10)</dr class="alt5"> </p>
<h3>
The Throne of His Glory
<h3>
<p>
The second place of Judgement is called "the throne of Christ's glory.” Those judged here will be those who remained on the earth during the tribulation period. The righteous will be resurrected and judged prior to Jesus setting up the Millennial Kingdom on earth. <dr class="alt5">And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgement was committed to them. Then I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their witness to Jesus and for the word of God, who had not worshipped the beast or his image, and had not received his mark on their foreheads or on their hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ for a[a] thousand years. 5 But the rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished. (Rev 20:4-5) </dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
The Great White Throne
</h3>
<p> 
The final place of Judgement is called the "great white throne.” Those judged here are the remaining dead who will be resurrected at the close of the Millennium. (This is the second resurrection called the resurrection of the unjust.) The Great White Throne Judgement is recorded in Rev 20:11-15. The unrighteous will be judged and because of their sin cast into a lake of fire along with Satan and his angels.</p>
<h3>
Eternal Judgement
</h3> 
There will be only two basic divisions of people who are tried in the final Judgements - Believers and unbelievers.</p>
<h3>
Believers
</h3>
<p>
Believers will be judged for their works and rewarded accordingly. <dr class="alt5">So then each of us shall give account of himself to God. (Rom 14:12)</dr class="alt5"> <dr class="alt5">For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad. (2 Cor 5:10)</dr class="alt5"></p> 
<p>
Believers will be judged by how they have built their lives on the foundation of God's Word:  <dr class="alt5">Now if anyone builds on this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each one’s work will become clear; for the Day will declare it, because it will be revealed by fire; and the fire will test each one’s work, of what sort it is. If anyone’s work which he has built on it endures, he will receive a reward. If anyone’s work is burned, he will suffer loss; but he himself will be saved ...(1 Cor 3:12-15)</dr class="alt5"> </p>
<p>
In the natural world, wood, hay, and stubble all grow visibly above the ground. They burn easily. They are examples of works done by believers to be seen by man. The motive for these works was wrong.</p>
<p>
Gold and silver are not destroyed by fire. In the natural world, these substances develop below the ground unseen by man. They are an example of works done with the right motive, not done just to be seen and praised by man. They are works which are valuable in God's Kingdom because they were done with the right motive.</p>
<p>
The works of true believers will be judged on the basis of obedience. The parables of the talents in Matt 25 and the parable of the pounds in Luke 19 were told by Jesus to illustrate this truth. In both these parables, servants were judged on the basis of what they had done with what they had been given. They were told to invest funds for their masters. Servants who were disobedient were judged unfaithful.</p>

Just like these parables, our Master has given us a responsibility. That responsibility is known as the Great Commission: Go ye therefore, and teach all nations, baptising them in the name of theFather, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:Teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you:and, lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.(Matthew 28:19-20) 

We are to take what God has given us, the message of the Gospel, and reproduce it by sharing it with others throughout the world. As we obey this commission, we are investing what God has given us and increasing it.

Some believers have greater responsibilities than others in this commission. Some are called as pastors, evangelists, teachers, etc. But every born-again believer has some responsibility in reaching the world with the Gospel. Believers will be judged on the basis of their faithfulness to the responsibility God has given them: Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.(I Corinthians 4:2) 

Believers will not be judged on the basis of abilities, education, or spiritual gifts. They will be judged on the basis of obedience and faithfulness to what God has given them to do. The Judgement of true believers is not one of condemnation. That is, the true believer cannot be condemned to eternal punishment. Through accepting Christ, he already has passed from spiritual death to eternal life: Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth onHim that sent me, hath everlasting life, and shall not come intocondemnation, but is passed from death unto life. (John 5:24) 

A true believer is one who has repented from sin and shown faith toward God by accepting Jesus Christ as personal Savior. He is one who has become and lived as a new creature in Jesus Christ. Paul confirmed: There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus,who walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit. (Romans 8:1) 

When a sinner comes to Jesus his record of former sins is erased by God. When a believer sins, he needs only to repent and confess his sin and God erases it from the record: If we confess our sins, He [God] is faithful and just to forgive us our sins andto cleanse us from all unrighteousness. (I John 1:9) 

Unbelievers:
The unrighteous will be judged and punished for sin. God keeps a record called the "book of life" in which is listed the names of those who have repented, accepted Jesus Christ, and become true believers. Those who have rejected Him will be judged for sin and doomed to eternal punishment. Their names are not in the book of life: And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into thelake of fire. (Revelation 20:15) 

It is important to understand that you must live as a new creature in Jesus after conversion. It is possible to be saved and then because of continuing in sin to "backslide" into the old life. The Bible confirms that it is possible to have your name written in the book of life but then have it blotted out because of sin: And the Lord said unto Moses, Whosoever hath sinned against me, him will Iblot out of my book. (Exodus 32:33) 

This is why learning to live a holy life is so important. (We will discuss this in the final chapter on perfection). By overcoming sin in your life, you can be assured God will not blot your name out of the book of life: He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I willnot blot out his name out of the book of life... (Revelation 3:5) 

The Destiny of the Righteous 
The righteous are destined to eternal life in the presence of God. The presence of God is called Heaven. In the Bible it is described by several names:

The Father's House: 
Jesus described it as His Father's house, a place of home, rest, and fellowship: In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have toldyou. I go to prepare a place for you. (John 14:2) 

A Heavenly Country: 
The Bible compares Heaven to a country to which we are traveling just as Israel traveled to the Promised Land: But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly; wherefore God isnot ashamed to be called their God; for He hath prepared for them a city.(Hebrews 11:16) 

A City: 
Heaven is compared to a city: And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from God out ofHeaven... (Revelation 21:2) 

The Bible reveals some wonderful things about Heaven. It is a place of:

Holiness: 
And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that defileth, neitherwhatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a lie; but they which arewritten in the Lamb's Book of Life. (Revelation 21:27) 

Joy: 
And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be nomore death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there by any more pain;for the former things are passed away. (Revelation 21:4) 

Beauty: 
And the building of the wall of it was of jasper; and the city was puregold, like unto clear glass. (Revelation 21:18) 

Service: 
Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve Him day and night inHis temple; and He that sitteth on the throne shall dwell among them.(Revelation 7:15) 

Reigning with Christ: 
Jesus promised... To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in His throne. (Revelation 3:21) 

Worship: 
The Bible records that those in Heaven... ...fell down and worshipped Him that liveth for ever and ever.(Revelation 5:14) 

Light and glory: 
And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon to shine in it: Forthe glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.(Revelation 21:23) 

A Place of New Perspective:
Being in Heaven will give us a new perspective on everything: For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former shall notbe remembered, nor come into mind. (Isaiah 65:17) 

The Dwelling Place of God: 
And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of  God is with men, and He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with the and be their God. (Revelation 21:3) 

Eternal Destiny of the Unrighteous 
Hell is the eternal destiny of the wicked. Hell is a place of:

Extreme Suffering: 
And the Devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of fire andbrimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormentedday and night for ever and ever. (Revelation 20:10) 

Memory and Remorse: 
And in Hell he lift up his eyes, being in torments, and seeth Abraham afaroff, and Lazarus in his bosom...But Abraham said, Son remember that thou in thy lifetime receivest thy goodthings, and likewise Lazarus evil things: but now he is comforted, and thouart tormented. (Luke 16:23,25) 

Unsatisfied Desire: 
And he cried and said, Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and sendLazarus, that he may dip the tip of his finger in water; and cool my tongue;for I am tormented in this flame. (Luke 16:24) 

Contempt: 
And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some toeverlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.(Daniel 12:2) 

Wicked Companionship: 
But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, andwhoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have theirpart in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone; which is the seconddeath. (Revelation 21:8) 

Hopelessness: 
When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: and the hope of unjust men perisheth. (Proverbs 11:7) 

Eternal Punishment: 
Hell was originally prepared for Satan and his angels. Because of sin, man is also destined for eternity in Hell unless He is redeemed by Jesus Christ: Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed,into everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his angels. (Matthew 25:41) Punishment for the wicked is eternal. The same word that is used for eternal life in the Bible (John 3:15) and the eternal God (I Timothy 1:17) is used to describe eternal Judgement (Hebrews 6:2). If one of these is temporary, then the other two would have to be temporary.
<p>
There is no way to escape the conclusion that if God is everlasting and eternal life is everlasting, then so is punishment in Hell. God does not send people to Hell. Man chooses to go there by rejecting Jesus Christ and living a sinful life. God has provided a way of escape from eternal punishment through the plan of salvation. He is not willing that any should perish.</p>
<h3>
How then should we live?
</h3>
<p> 
How should the doctrine of eternal Judgement affect our lives as believers? When writing on the subject of future Judgement, the Apostle Peter answered this question:<dr class="alt5"> Therefore, since all these things will be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness, ... Therefore, beloved, looking forward to these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, without spot and blameless;(2 Peter 3:11,14) </dr class="alt5"></p>
