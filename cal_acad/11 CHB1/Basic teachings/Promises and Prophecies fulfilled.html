Promises and Prophecies fulfilled
</h1>
<p>
Jesus Christ accurately fulfilled the prophecies that were written hundreds of years before His birth.
<dr class="alt5">"But those things which God foretold by the mouth of all His prophets, that the Christ would suffer, He has thus fulfilled." (Acts 3:18)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
To claim that you are God is one thing—but to convince people that you are indeed what you say you are is quite another. So how did Jesus' closest followers come to be so convinced that they would lay down their lives for that belief?</p>
<p>
Many Old Testament prophecies of the Messiah were fulfilled in precise detail by Jesus of Nazareth. Neither the Jews nor the disciples of Jesus understood at the time that Jesus was fulfilling the messianic prophecies of the Old Testament — even though at times He told them this was the case (Luke 18:31; Matt 26:56). They were looking for a far different Messiah than the One so many prophecies actually described.</p>
<p>
One of Jesus' defences to the Jews was to appeal to the Old Testament Scriptures themselves, which identified Him as the One to come.<dr class="alt5"> "You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify of Me." (John 5:39)</dr class="alt5"> He told them.</p>
<p>
After Jesus was resurrected, He began to help His disciples understand the Scriptures, and the disciples were inspired to declare that Jesus was indeed the Messiah. The proof they offered was the very Scriptures they had not previously understood.</p>
<h3>
Putting together the prophetic puzzle
</h3>
<p>
Shortly after His resurrection, Jesus met two of His disciples who were deep in discussion as they walked along the road to the town of Emmaus.<br> Not recognising Him, they openly reasoned how such events as the death of the Messiah could possibly happen. Jesus began to explain to them that His suffering and crucifixion were foretold in the Scriptures.
He gently chided them: <dr class="alt5">"Then He said to them, “O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into His glory?" (Luke 24:25-26)</dr class="alt5"><br>

Then, <dr class="alt5">"beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself." (Luke 24:27)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
Later that same day He appeared to nearly all of His apostles and clarified what He had been telling them before His death. <dr class="alt5">"These are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms concerning Me"<br> (Luke 24:44)</dr class="alt5">.<br>
"Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms" referred to the three major divisions of the Old Testament, something every believing Jew, as these apostles were, understood. <dr class="alt5">"And He opened their understanding, that they might comprehend the Scriptures. Then He said to them, "Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day'" <br>(Luke 24:45-46)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<h3>
God's Spirit opens the Scriptures to understanding
</h3>
<p>
Within days the apostles began quoting passages from Scripture, declaring that these prophecies had been fulfilled by Jesus Christ.<br>
Peter speaks of the death of Judas, the disciple who betrayed Jesus, in Acts 1:20 quoting from Psa 69 and Psa 109. <br><dr class="alt5">"Let their dwelling place be desolate; Let no one live in their tents."(Psa 69:25)</dr class="alt5"> and <dr class="alt5">"Let his days be few, and let another take his office." (Psa 109:8)</dr class="alt5"> <br>Peter and the disciples had begun to understand that the Scriptures spoke in detail of many aspects of Jesus' life, death and resurrection.</p>
<p>
After receiving the Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost, their understanding of the Scriptures would increase greatly <dr class="alt5">the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you.(John 14:26)</dr class="alt5">. <br>Speaking on that day, Peter quotes from Joel 2:28-29 telling us that the sending of the Holy Spirit was a fulfilment of that prophecy (Acts 2:14-18)<br>
Peter continues his message to the crowds gathered in Jerusalem by explaining the resurrection of Jesus with a reference to Psalm 16:8-11 <dr class="alt5">I have set the Lord always before me; because He is at my right hand ... For You will not leave my soul in Sheol [the grave], nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption [decay after death]...In Your presence is fullness of joy; [through resurrection from the grave]" (Acts 2:25-28)</dr class="alt5">.<br>
Peter asserts that David was a prophet and foresaw the resurrection of Jesus the Messiah.<br>
Even more astounding is David's picture of the resurrected Christ that Peter quotes: <dr class="alt5">"The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at My right hand, till I make Your enemies Your footstool'" (Acts 2:34-36)</dr class="alt5">. Peter now sees clearly that the Old Testament pictured the coming of Jesus the Messiah—the Messiah whom he followed for more than three years. Now Peter is quoting Scripture to his countrymen to prove to them that Jesus is the Messiah.</p>
<p>
Many years later we find Paul, who originally violently opposed those who accepted Jesus as the promised Messiah, reasoning with the Jews in synagogues that <dr class="alt5">“This Jesus whom I preach to you is the Christ.” (Acts 17:1-4)</dr class="alt5">. <br>Likewise Apollos <dr class="alt5">"refuted the Jews publicly, showing from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ" (Acts 18:28)</dr class="alt5">. Some of the Jews they addressed were beginning to understand their own Scriptures in the light of the life, death and resurrection of Jesus the Christ.</p>
<h3>
Fulfilled prophecies in the Gospels
</h3>
<p>
Those Jews who believed that Jesus fulfilled the messianic prophecies were in the minority. The Gospel writers, however, are relentless in their quotations from the Scriptures to demonstrate how Jesus fulfilled in detail the many messianic prophecies.
The apostle Matthew, for example, appears to have specifically written his Gospel to a first-century Jewish audience.<br>Through a series of Old Testament quotations, Matthew documents Jesus Christ's claim to be the Messiah. Jesus' genealogy, baptism, messages and miracles all point to the same inescapable conclusion: He is the prophesied Messiah.
Matthew's Gospel cites 21 prophecies that were fulfilled in circumstances surrounding the life and death of Christ. Eleven passages point out these fulfilments using such introductions as "that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of by the prophet..." or "then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet ..."</p>
<h3>
Accidental fulfilment of prophecies?
</h3>
<p>
The New Testament writers cite messianic prophecies from the Old Testament more than 130 times. 
<br> By some estimates the Old Testament contains 300 prophetic passages that describe who the Messiah is and what He will do. Of these, 60 are major prophecies. What are the chances of these prophecies being fulfilled in one person?<br>
Of course God makes no mistakes. It is virtually inconceivable that God would allow either a total deception in His name or an accidental fulfilment in the life of the wrong person. Such things rule out a chance fulfilment.
One might argue there is still that possibility—however remote. But the mathematical odds that all of these prophecies could have converged by chance in the events of the life of Jesus are staggeringly minute to the point of eliminating any such possibility.</p>
<p>
One or two fulfilments in Jesus' life could be dismissed as coincidental. But when the instances of fulfilled prophecies are counted up, the law of probability quickly reaches the point where mere probability becomes certainty. This is one of the proofs Jesus was the promised Messiah—the messianic prophecies were accurately and precisely fulfilled in Him.
