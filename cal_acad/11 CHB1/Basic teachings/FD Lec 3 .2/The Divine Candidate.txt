<h1>
The Divine Candidate
</h1>
<h3>
The candidate should be carefully taught
</h3>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; ..." (Matt 28:19-20</dr class="alt5">).</p>
<p>
The candidate should be taught all things that Jesus commanded. This is really much more necessary today than in the apostles' time, for the following reasons:<br>
There was a definite risk and sacrifice even in professing Christianity in the days of the apostles. Baptism tended to eliminate a mere nominal profession of His name. People do not relish scorn, reproach, division in the family or martyrdom just to take up a new religion. But, today, it is a matter of honour to be counted a congregation member. So every candidate for baptism should understand fully what it means to become a follower of Jesus.
In the apostolic days, Jesus Himself was the issue. No one regarded any Sabbath, but the Bible Sabbath. So that was not an issue. Today, however, the teachings of Jesus (as well as Jesus Himself) are the issue. What will the candidate do? Accept Jesus and reject His teachings? This is impossible. To receive Jesus as Master and Saviour means to accept all things whatsoever He commanded.</p>
<p>
One may join a "church" that preaches Jesus and yet deny almost every fundamental doctrine of Bible religion. We have, in the churches today, everything from fanaticism and playing with rattlesnakes to ethereal ideas that there is no evil, sin, or death. Millions seek some a mystical higher plane while evading the eternal teaching of the Word of God and avoiding the everlasting truths that sin is the transgression of the Law of God. They deny that the wages of sin is death, and that Jesus is the only Saviour from the transgression of the law. It is, therefore, essential that candidates for baptism be thoroughly taught all things that Jesus commanded; if not, the profession of Jesus may, in reality, be a fatal delusion and dangerous heresy.</p>
<h3>
He must believe
</h3>
<p><dr class="alt5">
He who believes and is baptised will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned. (Mark 16:16)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
After being taught, the candidate should, in his heart, believe in Jesus as Master, as a personal Saviour, and in His teaching. It is not enough to say, I believe in Jesus. Today that may mean almost anything. He should believe His Word and teachings as recorded in the Bible; and, by faith, follow his Saviour.</p>
<h3>
He must repent of his sins
</h3>
<p><dr class="alt5">
Then Peter said to them, “Repent, and let every one of you be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; (Acts 2:38).</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p> <dr class="alt5">
"For godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation, not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world produces death.” (2 Cor 7:10)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
To repent means to turn away from sin. It means to turn to God and righteousness. Man, of his own free will and choice, must make the decision to turn to God and away from sin and error.
A vital element of true repentance is sorrow,<dr class="alt5"> Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that your sorrow led to repentance(2 Cor 7:9-10)</dr class="alt5">. This repentance God will give us if we are willing to turn away from every sin (Acts 5:31; Rom 2:4). God's love melts the heart, and the Spirit of God makes us truly sorry for sin when we behold the precious Saviour dying for the sins we have committed.</p>
<h3>
He must be willing to die to sin by baptism 
</h3>
<p>
As Jesus died for sin, man must die to sin.<dr class="alt5"> Or do you not know that as many of us as were baptised into Christ Jesus were baptised into His death? (Rom 6:3)</dr class="alt5"> He will choose to lose a hand, a foot, an eye, before he wills to use them to do evil <dr class="alt5"> If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed, rather than having two hands, to go to hell, into the fire that shall never be quenched— where Their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched. And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame, rather than having two feet, to be cast into hell, into the fire that shall never be quenched— where Their worm does not die,and the fire is not quenched. And if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes, to be cast into hell fire— (Mark 9:43-47)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<h3>
He must be ready to live for God 
</h3>
<p><dr class="alt5">reckon yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Rom 6:11)</dr class="alt5">
And Jesus will dwell in him by His Holy Spirit. When Satan knocks at his heart door, he will find the old man gone - dead. A little girl put it this way: When Satan comes to my heart's door and calls for me, I tell him that Jesus lives here, and then Satan goes away. When God calls, we yield <dr class="alt5">our members as instruments of righteousness unto God (Rom 6:13)</dr class="alt5">. With Isaiah we say. <dr class="alt5">Here am I; send me (Isa 6:8)</dr class="alt5">. Such are born again men and women. Candidates for baptism should learn, believe, repent, die to sin, and surrender to God; therefore, infant baptism is not Biblical. We may dedicate our children to God, but infant baptism is without meaning in the light of these facts. There is no example for it in the New Testament!
