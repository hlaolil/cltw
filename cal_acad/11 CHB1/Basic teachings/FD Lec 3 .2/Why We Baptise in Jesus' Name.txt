<h1>
Why We Baptise in Jesus' Name
</h1>
<h3>
Introduction
</h3>
<p>
The subject of water baptism has long been called a great issue and no doubt has been made such by many church leaders of the past and present. In our study of it, let us first consider its importance, or the necessity of being baptised. Remember Jesus endorsed it many times and was Himself baptised!</p>
<h3>
The Importance of Water Baptism
</h3>
<p>
Christian water baptism is an ordinance instituted by Jesus Christ. If it is not important in the plan of God, why did Jesus command it in Matt 28:19? And why did Peter follow up by saying, <dr class="alt5">"let every one of you be baptised"</dr class="alt5"> commanding the Gentiles to be baptised (Acts 2:38; 10:48)? <br>
We must remember two points about the importance of water baptism. First, whatever Christ definitely established and ordained cannot be unimportant, whether we understand its significance or not. Second, Christ and the apostles showed the importance of this ordinance by observing it. Jesus walked many miles to be baptised, though He was without sin, saying,<dr class="alt5"> "for thus it is fitting for us to fulfil all righteousness.” (See Matt 3:13-16.)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
It is true that water itself does not contain any saving virtue, but God has chosen to include it in His plan of salvation. Peter explained, <dr class="alt5">"There is also an anti type which now saves us — baptism (not the removal of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God), through the resurrection of Jesus Christ," (1 Peter 3:21)</dr class="alt5">. According to Luke 7,<dr class="alt5"> "But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the will of God for themselves, not having been baptised by him." (Luke 7:30)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
The Mode of Baptism
</h3>
<p>
According to the Scriptures, the proper mode of baptism is immersion.<dr class="alt5"> "When He had been baptised, Jesus came up immediately from the water;" (Matt 3:16)</dr class="alt5">. </p>
<p>
"And they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptised him" (Acts 8:38). </p>
<p>
"Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death" (Romans 6:4). A corpse is not buried by placing it on top of the ground and sprinkling a little soil on it, but by covering it completely.</p>
<p>
According to the World Book Encyclopaedia, "At first all baptism was by complete immersion" (vol. 1, p.651). And the Catholic Encyclopaedia states, "In the early centuries, all were baptised by immersion in streams, pools, and baptisteries" (vol. 2, p.263). Immersion was not convenient after the Catholic church instituted infant baptism; thus the mode was changed to sprinkling. (See Encyclopaedia Britannica, 11th edition, vol. 3, pp.365-66.)</p>
<p>
Repentance identifies us with the death of Christ, and baptism identifies us with His burial. Coming forth from the watery grave of baptism and receiving new life in the Holy Spirit identifies us with His resurrection.</p>
<h3>
The Formula for Baptism
<h3>
<p>
Jesus commanded His disciples to <dr class="alt5">"make disciples of all the nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit," (Matt 28:19)</dr class="alt5">. He did not command them to use these words as a formula, but He commanded them to baptise in "the name." The word name is used here in the singular, and it is the focal point of the baptismal command. The titles Father, Son, and Holy Spirit describe God's relationships to humanity and are not the supreme, saving name described here, which is Jesus. <dr class="alt5">"Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.” (Acts 4:12)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
Jesus is the name in which the roles of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are revealed. The angel of the Lord instructed Joseph, <dr class="alt5">"And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins." (Matt 1:21)</dr class="alt5">.<br> 
Jesus said,<dr class="alt5"> "I have come in My Father’s name,"<dr class="alt5"> and,<dr class="alt5"> "But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name," (John 5:43; 14:26)</dr class="alt5">. 
Thus by baptising in the name of Jesus, we honour the Godhead. <dr class="alt5">"For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily;" (Col 2:9)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<>p
Luke 24:45-46 records that just before His ascension, <dr class="alt5">He opened their understanding, that they might comprehend the Scriptures</dr class="alt5">. It was necessary that their understanding be opened, and many today need this same operation in order to understand the Scriptures. Then Jesus said to them, <dr class="alt5">"Then He said to them, “Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise[a] from the dead the third day,."</dr class="alt5"> The disciples had their understanding opened so that they could grasp the vast importance of the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ. Luke 24:47 describes the commission that Jesus then gave:<dr class="alt5"> "and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem."</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Peter was one of that number to whom Jesus had spoken and whose understanding had been opened. After having listened to these instructions, a few days later he was inspired by the Holy Spirit to preach on the Day of Pentecost. The hearts of the hearers were pierced and, feeling condemned, they cried out to Peter and the other apostles, <dr class="alt5">"Men and brethren, what shall we do?" (Acts 2:37)</dr class="alt5">. Peter did not hesitate but boldly answered, <dr class="alt5">“Repent, and let every one of you be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit." (Acts 2:38)</dr class="alt5">. "Then those who gladly received his word were baptised; and that day about three thousand souls were added to them" (Acts 2:41).</p>
<p>
Some say that Peter told them to be baptised in Jesus' name because they were Jews and this baptism was to make them acknowledge Jesus Christ. But let us go with Peter to the house of Cornelius several years later. Cornelius and his household were Gentiles, yet there again Peter <dr class="alt5">"commanded them to be baptised in the name of the Lord." (Acts 10:48)</dr class="alt5">. (Most translations actually say, "In the name of Jesus Christ.") If Peter was wrong on the Day of Pentecost, he surely had ample time to be corrected before he went to the house of Cornelius.</p>
<p>
Was Peter wrong on the Day of Pentecost? When the hearers were prickled in their hearts, they spoke to Peter and to the rest of the apostles (Acts 2:37). This included Matthew, who wrote Matt 28:19. Moreover, when Peter preached, he stood up with the eleven (Acts 2:14). Matthew was there, yet we find no words of correction from him. He surely would have spoken up if Peter had disobeyed the Lord. But all the apostles understood and carried out the Lord's commission.</p>
<p>
As Jesus said in prayer, <dr class="alt5">"I have manifested Your Name to the men whom You have given Me out of the world. They were Yours, You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word." (John 17:6)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
The Samaritans, who were not Jews, were also baptised in the name of Jesus. <dr class="alt5">Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ to them ..." (Acts 8:5)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p> <dr class="alt5">
But when they believed Philip as he preached the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were baptised." (Acts 12, 16)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
Let us see how Paul, the apostle to the Gentiles, baptised. He went to Ephesus many years after the Day of Pentecost and found some disciples of John the Baptist there.<dr class="alt5"> "he said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” So they said to him, “We have not so much as heard whether there is a Holy Spirit.” And he said to them, “Into what then were you baptised?” So they said, “Into John’s baptism.” Then Paul said, “John indeed baptised with a baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe on Him who would come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus.” When they heard this, they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus." (Acts 19:2-5)</dr class="alt5">. Although these disciples had already been baptised, the name of Jesus was so important as to cause them to be baptised again in His name.</p>
<p>
We do not believe that Paul changed the formula or mode of baptism when he baptised Lydia and her household (Acts 16:14-15) or the Philippian jailer. The latter came trembling and fell down before Paul and Silas, saying, <dr class="alt5">"Sirs, what must I do to be saved?” So they said, “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, you and your household.” Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house. And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes. And immediately he and all his family were baptised." (Acts 16:30-33)</dr class="alt5">. How can we doubt that Paul baptised these people using the same mode and formula that he used elsewhere, that is, immersion in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ?</p>
<p>
Paul was not with the apostles when Jesus gave his finial instructions to them in Matthew 28:19 and Luke 24:47, yet Paul baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus. How did he know what to do? He said that his gospel was not a tradition of men but a revelation from God. <dr class="alt5">"But I make known to you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man. For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but it came through the revelation of Jesus Christ." (Gal 1:11-12)</dr class="alt5">. Paul was chosen to bear Jesus' name to the Gentiles, and he wrote many divinely inspired epistles to the church. To this apostle, God revealed the mystery of the church, <dr class="alt5">"which in other ages was not made known to the sons of men, as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to His holy apostles and prophets:" (Eph 3:5)</dr class="alt5">. Paul claimed to have divine authority: <dr class="alt5">"If anyone thinks himself to be a prophet or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things which I write to you are the commandments of the Lord." (1 Cor 14:37)</dr class="alt5">. And Paul wrote, <dr class="alt5"> And whatever you do in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him." (Col 3:17)<dr class="alt5">. Water baptism is done in both word and deed. We cannot afford to overlook this command to the church.</p>
<p>
The church is "built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner stone" (Eph 2:20). The apostles not only preached baptism in Jesus' name, but they practised it. Nowhere can we find that they baptised using the words "in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit." Instead, we find them baptising in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. In baptising in Jesus' name, they fulfilled the command of the Lord in Matthew 28:19.
Paul said,<dr class="alt5"> "But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed." (Gal 1:8)</dr class="alt5">. Let this be a solemn warning to us.</p>
<p>
Some say that they will accept the words of Jesus in Matthew 28:19 but not those of Peter in Acts 2:38. But Peter spoke on the Day of Pentecost under the anointing of the Holy Spirit. Peter was one of the apostles, and to him had been given the keys of the kingdom, so we have no right to discredit his words.</p>
<p>
In Mark 7:8 Jesus said, "For laying aside the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men" History tells us that it was not until many years after the apostles that the mode and formula of baptism in the name of Jesus Christ were changed. (See Hastings' Dictionary of the Bible, vol. 1, p.241.) Which means more to you, the command of the Lord or the tradition of men?</p>
