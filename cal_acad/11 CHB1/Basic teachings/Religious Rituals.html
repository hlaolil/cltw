Religious Rituals
</h1>
<p>
Is it possible for the vital aspects of our Christian walk like prayer, bible reading, fasting, communion, church attendance, giving, and missions to become dead works? Is it possible for these activities to have no value in God’s estimate and produce no fruit in our lives? In fact, yes it is possible! These things can become just religious rituals that bring no benefit to our spiritual growth if it is not based on the perfect finished work of Jesus at the cross.</p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
Therefore, leaving the discussion of the elementary principles of Christ, let us go on to perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God (Heb 6:1)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Notice in the above verse that repentance from dead works and faith toward God is foundational to our Christian walk. The reference to dead works here is not talking about sins like immorality, murder etc. It is referring to, in the whole context, anything we do to earn from God without trusting in the perfect work of Jesus at the cross. This verse tells us to repent from dead works. This simply means to forsake our wrong belief that by doing religious rituals we can be saved or earn the blessings of God.</p>
<p>
I have met so many believers who are involved in “Christian rituals” thinking that by doing them it will cause God to love them more, accept them more, bless them more and make them more holy. However, they are blinded from the Good News that God in fact already loves them, has accepted them, blessed them and made them righteous because of the price Jesus paid for them at the cross! <br>Things we do, no matter how spiritual they seem, if not done by having faith in the work of Jesus, God calls them dead works! God wants us to turn away from dead religious works and have faith in what His son has accomplished for us.</p>
<p>
Am I telling you to stop praying or fasting or taking communion or attending church or giving? No! What I am saying is to do these things as a response to what God has done for you in Christ and not to earn from Him.</p>
<p>
I believe the reason why so many Christians burn out and become frustrated doing these things is because they don’t do it with the revelation of the finished work of Jesus.</p>
<p>
We don’t pray to be close to God, we pray because through Jesus we are already close to God! We don’t go to church to earn His blessings, we go because we want to celebrate with our fellow believers the blessings that God has already given to us in Christ!</p>
<p>
My friend, I want to challenge you today to turn from dead works and believe in the Good News that the price for every blessing in your life is completely paid for at the cross. When you do things on the foundation of the cross than you will find true joy and see great fruits in your Christian walk.</P>
