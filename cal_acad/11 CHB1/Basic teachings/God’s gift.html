God’s gift

<h3>
Salvation
</h3>
<p>
The context surrounding Ephesians 2:8 is all about salvation; absent is any explicit mention of saving faith as part of God’s gift nor whether faith is the response to salvation.<br> If faith was a divine gift, it would have a seeming contradiction to Paul’s earlier statements such as, <dr class="alt5">"Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved" <br>(Acts 16:31)</dr class="alt5"> or <br><dr class="alt5">"So faith comes from hearing and hearing by the word of Christ" (Rom 10:17).</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Aside from the interpretive possibility of Ephesians 2:8, there seems scant biblical evidence that "faith" is a gift from God.<br> When Paul holds up Abraham as an example of faith, he esteems Abraham’s personal and self generated faith.<br> In another example where Jesus is conversing with Martha (John 11:25-27), Martha demonstrates a self generated belief of something that was true (Jesus as the Messiah).</p>
<p>
The Bible clearly exhorts human beings to believe with the imperative "believe in": Mark 1:15; John 1:12; 3:18; 10:38; 12:36; 20:31; Acts 16:31; Romans 10:9; Galatians 2:16; 1 Thessalonians 4:14; etc.</p>
<h3>
Faith
</h3>
<p>
The Bible appears to indicate that faith is the responsibility of the hearer: <br>John 5:46; Luke 24:25; Acts 26:27; etc.<br>

So if saving faith was the gift of God, a contradiction exists. Wouldn’t the divine gift of faith absolve anyone of responsibility for it?

The Bible makes a distinction between faith and works; faith (the act of believing something is factually true with trust) is not considered work.</p>
<h3>
Works
</h3>
<p>
Works cannot result in saving faith: Acts 13:38-39; Romans 3:21-22, 28; Galatians 2:15-16; 3:1-9.

Genuine faith results in works: James 2:14-26.</p>
<h3>
Faith precedes Salvation
</h3>
<p>
The biblical evidence explicitly indicates that faith precedes salvation<br> (John 5:24; Rom 3:21-26; Gal 3:1-5) and is not simultaneous nor a response to it. Works is implied in the phrase <dr class="alt5">"and not of yourselves" (Eph 2:8)</dr class="alt5">; however, it is not likely that faith is included with human efforts of good deeds or compliance to Mosaic legislation.</p>
<p>
The interpretive controversy of Ephesians 2:8 reflects the tension between God’s sovereignty / omniscience and human will / responsibility.<br> God’s own Son, Jesus Christ, was the divine gift that was provided for the sin offering to pay the judicial price of mankind’s past, present and future sin. <br>The fact that faith is a personal response on the part of people must be balanced with the fact that God is sovereign.<br> The Bible clearly teaches that God convicts men of their need for salvation:<br>

<dr class="alt5">Then Peter said to them, “Repent, and let every one of you be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.(Acts 2:38)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
