   <h1>
Hands - Ordaining by Ministries
</h1>
<p>
Acts 13 includes a good example of a ministerial appointment: <dr class="alt5"><br>“While they were worshipping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them". So after they had fasted and prayed, they placed their hands on them and sent them off. The two of them, sent on their way by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia” (Acts 13:2-4)</dr class="alt5">.</p> 
<p>
In this passage, we note some key facts: </p>
<p>1) It is God Himself who calls the men to the ministry and qualifies them with &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;gifts (Acts 20:28; Ephesians 4:11).</p>
<p>2) The members of the church recognise God’s clear leading and embrace it.</p> <p>3) With prayer and fasting, the church lays hands on Paul and Barnabas to &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;demonstrate their commissioning (cf. Acts 6:6; 1 Timothy 5:22).</p>
<p>4) God works through the church, as both the church and the Spirit are said to &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;“send” the missionaries.</p>
<p>
Paul regularly ordained pastors for the churches he planted. He and Barnabas directed the appointment or ordination of elders “in each church” in Galatia <br>(Acts 14:23). <br>He instructed Titus to “appoint elders in every town” on Crete (Titus 1:5). <br>Titus himself had been ordained earlier, when “he was chosen by the churches” (2 Cor 8:19). In the above passages, the ordination of elders involves the whole congregation, not just the apostles.<br> The Greek word used in 2 Cor 8:19 for Titus’s appointment and in Acts 14:23 for the choosing of the Galatian elders literally means “to stretch forth the hands.” It was a word normally used for the act of voting in the Athenian legislature. Thus, the ordination of church leaders involved a general consensus in the church, if not an official vote. The apostles and the congregations knew whom the Spirit had chosen, and they responded by placing those men in leadership.</p>
<p>
When God calls and qualifies a man for the ministry, it will be apparent both to that man and to the rest of the church. <br>The would-be minister will meet the qualifications set forth in 1 Tim 3:1-16 and Titus 1:5-9, and he will possess a consuming desire to preach (1 Cor 9:16). <br>It is the duty of the church elders, together with the congregation, to recognise and accept the calling. After that, a formal commissioning ceremony—an ordination service—is appropriate, though by no means mandatory. <br>The ordination ceremony itself does not confer any special power; it simply gives public recognition to God’s choice of leadership.</p>
