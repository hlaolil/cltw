Laying on of Hands
</h1>
<p><dr class="alt5">
Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ,
let us go on to perfection; not laying again the foundation
of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,
Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of <font color="firebrick">laying on of hands</font>, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgement.(Hebrews 6:1-2)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
Laying on of hands in Christianity
</h3>
<p>
Laying on of hands is a special gesture in Christianity. It is the act of one Christian laying their hands on another to heal them, impart God’s blessing on them, give them the Holy Spirit, dispense their spiritual gifts, or appoint them to a new ministry. Laying on of hands is usually accompanied by prayer; the person laying the hands prays at the same time.<br><dr class="alt5">
Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them. (Acts 6:6)</dr class="alt5"><dr class="alt5"><br>
Then little children were brought to Him that He might put His hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them. (Matt 19:13)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Laying on of hands is one of the most basic doctrines of the faith. Some may find this surprising, since many churches neither teach it nor practice it. If you have been a Christian for any length of time, you will realise that these are the most basic doctrines of the faith. Yet sometimes it is good for us to have the basics refreshed in our mind. Laying on of hands is one of these basic doctrines, yet unfortunately few know about it. Hebrews 6 states that laying on of hands is one of the principle, basic, doctrines of Christ and places it in the same doctrinal category as repentance from dead works and faith toward God. (Heb 6:1-2)
</p><p>
Laying on of hands is basic, milky doctrine and this passage says that we need to know it <font size="+1">TO GO ONTO PERFECTION</font>. Now lets go on to perfection ...<br>
Laying on of hands is used the most in the Bible for healing the sick.
<br> Divine healing did not end after the apostles died. <br>Jesus said,<dr class="alt5"> “And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues;they will take up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it will by no means hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.” (Mark 16:17,18)</dr class="alt5">.<br> The healing was to follow them that believe. Note that this is part of the Great Commission!! It doesn’t just apply to the early church.</p>
<p>
But on the other hand you should not go running after signs and wonders, either. <br>Jesus said a <dr class="alt5">"An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign" (Matt 12:39)</dr class="alt5">. Signs and wonders are primarily for unbelievers. There are charlatans out there TODAY doing false miracles and attracting people to them.<br> When the Antichrist comes <dr class="alt5">with all power, signs, and lying wonders <br>(2 Thess 2:9)</dr class="alt5">, they will flock after him like sheep off to the slaughter.</p>
<h3>
Healed by laying on of hands
</h3>
<p>
Here are several cases where people were healed by laying on of hands.<br>

<dr class="alt5">"... and begged Him earnestly, saying, “My little daughter lies at the point of death. Come and lay Your hands on her, that she may be healed, and she will live.” (Mark 5:23)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">Then Jesus put out His hand and touched him, saying, “I am willing; be cleansed.” Immediately his leprosy was cleansed. (Matt 8:3)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">So He touched her hand, and the fever left her. And she arose and served them. (Matt 8:15)</dr class="alt5">
</p>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">Now He could do no mighty work there, except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them. (Mark 6:5)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">
So He took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the town. And when He had spit on his eyes and put His hands on him, He asked him if he saw anything. And he looked up and said, “I see men like trees, walking.” Then He put His hands on his eyes again and made him look up. And he was restored and saw everyone clearly. (Mark 8:23-25)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
When the sun was setting, all those who had any that were sick with various diseases brought them to Him; and He laid His hands on every one of them and healed them. (Luke 4:40)</dr class="alt5">
</p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
And behold, there was a woman who had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years, and was bent over and could in no way raise herself up. But when Jesus saw her, He called her to Him and said to her, “Woman, you are loosed from your infirmity.” And He laid His hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God. (Luke 13:11-13)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
And in a vision he has seen a man named Ananias coming in and putting his hand on him, so that he might receive his sight.(Acts 9:12)<dr class="alt5"></p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
And it happened that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and dysentery. Paul went in to him and prayed, and he laid his hands on him and healed him.<br> (Acts 28:8)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
Laying on of hands at Baptism
</h3>
<p>
Laying on of hands can be used to give a Christian the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. Of course it is not the only way that you can receive Him. You can receive the Holy Spirit by simply asking God for Him. Some even receive His Baptism at salvation. But laying on of hands can sometimes be more effective.</p> 
<p><dr class="alt5">
And when Simon saw that through laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money, (Acts 8:18)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied. (Acts 19:6)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
Laying on of hands to receive gifts
</h3>
<p>
Laying on of hands is also one of the ways used to give someone their spiritual gifts. Since the Holy Spirit gives you your gifts (1 Cor 12:11), you get your gifts when you receive the Baptism of the Holy Spirit. And since the Baptism of the Holy Spirit can come from laying on of hands, your spiritual gifts can be given to you by laying on of hands.<br> <dr class="alt5">“And when Paul had laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.” (Acts 19:6).</dr class="alt5"> <br>When Paul laid his hands on these people, they received the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit gave them the gifts of tongues and prophecy.<br> Paul’s young companion Timothy also received his spiritual gift by laying on of hands:<br>
<dr class="alt5">
Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the eldership. (1 Tim 4:14)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
Therefore I remind you to stir up the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands. (2 Tim 1:6)</dr class="alt5">
</p>
<p>Laying on of hands is used to impart blessing on one another. My pastor at church will hold up his hand with palm toward the congregation, like laying on everyone at once, while saying the last prayer.</p>
<h3>
Jesus blessed the little children
</h3> 
<p>Parents brought their children to Jesus so that He could touch them and lay hands on them. They did this because they knew He would bless them by touching them.
<dr class="alt5"><br>
Then little children were brought to Him that He might put His hands on them and pray, but the disciples rebuked them. But Jesus said, “Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of heaven.”<br>And He laid His hands on them and departed from there. (Matt 19:13-15)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
Then they brought little children to Him, that He might touch them; but the disciples rebuked those who brought them. But when Jesus saw it, He was greatly displeased and said to them, “Let the little children come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of God. Assuredly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter it.” And He took them up in His arms, laid His hands on them, and blessed them. (Mark 10:13-16)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
Laying on of hands to appointed people 
</h3>
<p>
Laying on of hands is also done (or should be done) when appointing people to new ministries, such as sending people out to the mission field, or giving them the office of a deacon. When Paul and Barnabas were sent out on their first missionary journey, the disciples laid hands on them. They had been ministers of the gospel for several years, but this missionary ministry was new to them.
<dr class="alt5">
As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, “Now separate to Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” Then, having fasted and prayed, and laid hands on them, they sent them away. (Acts 13:2-3)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
The apostles prayed and laid hands on those who were selected to help distribute food and other necessities to the needy and widows (kind of like deacons or overseers). Although their ministry of helps seems small, it was important, and shows laying on of hands should be used to place people into greater ministries, also.</p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
And the saying pleased the whole multitude. And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch, whom they set before the apostles; and when they had prayed, they laid hands on them. (Acts 6:5-6)
</dr class="alt5"></p>

<p>Laying on of hands is Biblical, but there are some cautions that need to be taken.<dr class="alt5"> “Do not lay hands on anyone hastily, nor share in other people’s sins; keep yourself pure” (1 Tim 5:22)</dr class="alt5">.<br> You should not lay hands on someone if you do not know what you are doing. Note that in all the Scriptures quoted in this article, it was one of the apostles who were laying on the hands. Most laying on of hands in the church should be by the leadership, and established Christians if necessary. A new believer should<font size="+1"> NOT</font> be laying hands on people till they have been grounded in the faith, at least, and understand what they are doing. If you lay hands on people, you should make sure that the person is sincere in the faith (not someone from outside pretending to be a Christian). If they are asking for the Holy Spirit, make sure that they are committed to obey and follow Christ at all costs and in all areas of their life. If you are letting someone lay hands on you, make sure that they are a man of God.

Laying on of hands is one of the principle doctrines of Christ. So now lets go out and practice it.
