Weaning

<h3>
A contrast between milk and solid food.
</h3>
<p>
And you have come to need milk and not solid food. For everyone who partakes only of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe. But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, that is, those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.</p>
<p>
And you have come to need milk: Milk corresponds to the first principles of <br>(Heb 6:12). <br>Solid food is the “meatier” material such as understanding the connection between Jesus and Melchizedek. It isn’t that milk is bad; but these Christians should have added solid food to their diet. Peter reminds us all as newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby <br>(1 Peter 2:2).</p>
<p>
In the original language, the sense of for he is a babe is for he has become a babe. There is nothing more delightful than a true babe in Jesus. But there is nothing more irritating and depressing than someone who should be mature but who has become a babe!</p>
<h3>
Have you become a babe?
</h3>
<p>
Perhaps your Christian life is unstable. Babies are handed from one person to another; babes are tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine (Eph 4:14-16).</p>
<p>
Perhaps you are divisive in your Christian life. Babies each have their own crib that they stick to; babes have their particular denomination or church that they think of as “my church.”</p>
<p>
Perhaps you are star-struck by Christian celebrities of one kind or another. Babies are focused on one particular person (mommy); babes glory in men <br>(I am of Paul, I am of Apollos).</p>
<p>
Perhaps you are spiritually asleep. Babies need a lot of sleep; babes spend much time spiritually asleep.</p>
<p>
Perhaps you are fussy and cranky with others. Babies can be cranky; babes will fuss over any little thing.</p>
