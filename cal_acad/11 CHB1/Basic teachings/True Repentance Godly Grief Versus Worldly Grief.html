True Repentance <br>Godly Grief Versus Worldly Grief
</h1>
<p>
If we are to know whether or not our repentance is genuine, we must first examine the nature of our sorrow.<br> Is our grief godly or carnal? The passage which gives the clearest demarcation of true remorse and worldly sorrow is 2 Cor 7:
<dr class="alt5"><br>
For even if I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it; though I did regret it. For I perceive that the same epistle made you sorry, though only for a while. Now I rejoice, not that you were made sorry, but that your sorrow led to repentance. For you were made sorry in a godly manner, that you might suffer loss from us in nothing. For godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation, not to be regretted; but the sorrow of the world produces death.<br> (2 Cor 7:8-10)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
Godly Grief
</h3>
<p>
Grief goes beyond mere emotions. It is not uncommon to feel guilt, shame, or regret when caught in a sin. Yet true grief is identified by one’s response to it.<br> If one is godly, the shame that he experienced will lead him to humble himself before God. He will recognise that he has disgraced God and will earnestly desire to be restored to Him.<br> Mourning loss of communion between himself, God and others, he will grow to hate his sin.<br>
His grief will lead to repentance, which will result in salvation without regret. This occurs because the godly man turns away from his sin and focuses on the pardoning grace of God. He will recognise that he has received God’s mercy and forgiveness of his sin. </p>
<p>
Therefore godly grief is that remorse or sorrow which leads one to humbly repent to God. Peter in John 21 portrays his intimate restoration to Christ. Peter’s godly grief over denying Him three times results in his humble triadic affirmation to shepherd Jesus’ flock.</p>
<h3>
Worldly grief
</h3>
<p>
Conversely, Paul describes worldly grief as leading to death. All emotions of shame and regret do not result in a humble repentance for those who experience ungodly sorrow. Instead, worldly grief leads to death because there is no restoration to God.</p> 
<p>
Stuart Scott says that:
“Shallow remorse can involve:
<ul><li><font size="">
Sorrow over getting caught and being found out.</font>
<li><font size="">Sorrow over the consequences in or of getting caught</font>
<li><font size="">Sorrow over the response of others.</font> 
<li><font size="">The offering of an apology saying, “I’m sorry” without any mention of repentance or change and without asking forgiveness.</font> 
<li><font size="">Trying to do penance by doing unrelated good things to make the consequences go away, to try to cancel out one’s wrong-doing, or to appease God.</font> 
<li><font size="">Making at least some justification for the sin committed.</font> 
<li><font size="">Complaining about the expectation of real change.”</font></p></ul></li>
<p>
In short, they do not hate their sin or desire to do what is necessary to truly reconcile severed relationships. Therefore, worldly grief is sorrow over the consequences of sin, yet without any remorse over dishonouring God. It leads to a focus on self and away from God. <br>Judas felt great sorrow over his sin, but he never sought reconciliation to God. His grief was not from the recognition of the evil of his sin but from the punishment he would receive as a result of betraying innocent blood.</p>
<p>
Another biblical example of worldly grief is King Saul in 1 Sam 15 
Unlike his successor, David, he never truly humbled himself and repented to God. As a result of Saul’s worldly grief he was rejected by God and given an evil spirit to torment him. He eventually lost both his throne and his life because he feared man more than God (1 Chron 10:13-14).</p> 
<p>
This should lead us to ask a few questions of ourselves. Why do you feel sorrow over your sin? Is it because you fear man or consequences? Or is it because you are grieved by knowing that you have offended God? Do you really hate your sin? Are you willing to do what is necessary to be reconciled to God and those whom you have sinned against?</p> 
<p>
May we all be grieved over our sin, leading us to repent and place our trust in the only one who can restore without regret.</p>
