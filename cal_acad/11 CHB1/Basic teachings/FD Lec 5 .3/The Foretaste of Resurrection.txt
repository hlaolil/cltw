<h3>
The Spirit and the Christ-event.
</h3>
<p> 
According to Paul, the giving of the Spirit is linked to that great eschatological event at the mid-point of history: the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The events of the Cross were completely overcome in the minds of the early believers in the light of the resurrection and the coming of the Spirit. According to Gal 3:13-14, Christ’s death on the Cross opened up the way for the coming of Spirit (cf. also Rom. 8:1-4). </p>
<p>
Without the resurrection, of course, the Cross would have been a disaster, and so we find that the resurrection and the Spirit are more closely related than the Cross and the Spirit. In Rom. 8:11 we are informed that the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in the believer. In 1 Cor 6 Paul says <dr class="alt5">And God both raised up the Lord and will also raise us up by His power. (1 Cor 6:14)<dr class="alt5"> That power is an equivalent for pneuma is not hard to show from the New Testament.  Another synonym for Spirit is doxa, and it is expressly stated that Christ was raised by the Spirit of the Father (Rom. 6:4). Not only is the Spirit thought of as the power at work in the raising of Jesus from the dead, but the post-resurrection life of our Lord is characterised by the Spirit <dr class="alt5">and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead.” (Rom 1:4)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
In his new mode of existence Christ is also the Dispenser of the Spirit. The Spirit is the gift of the risen Lord. It is through the gift of the Spirit that the believer experiences the presence and the power of the risen Lord in his life. “The Holy Spirit is the gift of the risen Christ to the church. This is the central New Testament message concerning the Spirit.” The Spirit receives character and identity through His connection with Jesus Christ, the risen and exalted Lord. The Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Rom. 8:9, Phil. 1:19). “The resurrection is the occasion of the liberating of Christ to be a life-giving Spirit,” says Hill. “This in very personal terms means that Christ is known to be alive because He is experienced today as a power influencing our lives and this living and abiding impact is the Spirit.” The Spirit is the earthly presence of the glorified Lord. The gift of the Spirit is the church’s guarantee that Christ has begun His reign, having assumed authority as He sits at God’s right hand, and this reign of Christ is seen uniquely in the church.</p>
<p>
In 2 Cor. 3:17 it appears at first sight as if the exalted Lord is identified with the Spirit (“The Lord is the Spirit”), but the remainder of the verse cautions us against this view (“Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty”). Although frequently the work of Christ and the work of the Spirit are quite interchangeable, the memory of the historical career of Jesus did not permit the fusing of the living Christ with the Holy Spirit in Christian thought and worship.  Nevertheless we can safely say that the Spirit describes the manner in which the risen Christ is present in the church today. The expression “The Lord is the Spirit,” The Spirit communicates to men the benefits of the risen Christ; it bridges the gap between transcendence and immanence.</p>
<p>
Not only is Christ present in the church by the power of His Spirit, but the Spirit enables men to acknowledge and to confess Him as Lord. In 1 Cor. 12:3 Paul asserts that no one can say “Jesus is Lord” except by the Holy Spirit. To acknowledge Christ as Lord today is possible only because He died and rose again yesterday. And it implies that He will come tomorrow to judge the quick and the dead.</p> 
<p>
Another way of expressing the conviction that the messianic age, the age of the Spirit, had dawned in Christ was to proclaim that He had established a new covenant and that this covenant was a covenant of the Spirit.</p>
<h3>
The Spirit and the New Covenant.
</h3>
<p> 
Israel’s national existence, according to the Old Testament, began when God established His covenant with His people. When Israel became apostate, the prophets faced the dilemma of reconciling the fact that Israel had broken the covenant with Yahweh with the fact that Yahweh’s grace was unchanging. Out of this situation the hopes of a new covenant were born and the prophetic outlook is Jer 31.</p>
<p>
The coming of the Spirit convinced the early church that this hope had been fulfilled in Christ. The old covenant is described by Paul (2 Cor. 3) as a covenant of death, written and engraved on stones. The new is a covenant of the pneuma—an antithesis which he derives from Jer. 31:33.  The apostle goes on (2 Cor. 3:6) to compare the ministry of the old covenant with that of the new, which he calls a ministry of the Spirit. In contrast to the ephemeral glory of the old covenant and its ministry, the ministry of the Spirit has a greater splendour (2 Cor. 3:8).</p>
<h3>
The Spirit and the Awareness of the New Age.
</h3>
<p>
It was only when the Spirit was poured out that the apostles became convinced that by His passion Christ had inaugurated in the new age. Frequently the writers of the New Testament admit that the meaning of the Christ-event lay hidden in God and that it was only now at the turning point of the ages that God’s purposes had come to light (cf. Eph. 1:8, 9; 3:9; Col. 1:26; 1 Pet. 1:20). Paul argues in 1 Cor. 2:7, 8 that only those who have God’s Spirit can understand what God did in Christ. The rulers of this world acted foolishly because they were blind to what God was doing at the Cross. The believers, who have God’s spirit, understand, for “God has revealed it to us through the Spirit” (1 Cor 2:10). What is more, the Spirit provides the language that makes conversation about these truths possible. Christian teaching is done <dr class="alt5">“not in words which man’s wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit” (1 Cor 2:13)</dr class="alt5">. <dr class="alt5">The natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. (1 Cor 2:14)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
The reason the leaders did not know what they were doing when they crucified the Lord of glory is that they belong to <dr class="alt5">“this age” (1 Cor 2:6)</dr class="alt5">. The believers who have <dr class="alt5">the Spirit who is from God</dr class="alt5"> (<dr class="alt5">not the “spirit of the world,”</dr class="alt5"> i.e., the wisdom of this age, <dr class="alt5">(1 Cor 2:12)</dr class="alt5"> now understand the mysteries of God. What former generations did not see is now made known to apostles and prophets <dr class="alt5">“by the Spirit” (Eph. 3:5)</dr class="alt5">. But all believers, not only the primary witnesses of the Christ-event, can see what God did when He raised Christ from the dead through <dr class="alt5">“the Spirit of wisdom and revelation” (Eph. 1:17ff)</dr class="alt5">. In his second prayer in Ephesians, the writer asked God to strengthen the readers <dr class="alt5">with might through His Spirit, ... so that they may be filled with all the fullness of God (Eph 3:16,19)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
By the Spirit the early believers recognised that the new age had dawned, but the Spirit also gave them the assurance that there was more in the offing. The Spirit was but a foretaste of what lay beyond time. Paul prays that his Roman readers might abound in hope <dr class="alt5">“by the power of the Holy Spirit” (Rom 15:13)</dr class="alt5">. The Spirit was the sign that the new age had been inaugurated, that the Christ is present with His own during the interim, and that this age (in which the new and old overlap) will be consummated.

The Spirit and the Consummation of the Age

<h3>
The Spirit and the Assurances of Hope
</h3>
<p>
The Sealing with the Spirit. One way of expressing the certainty of the Christian hope is to say that the people of God have been “sealed with the Spirit.” The Holy Spirit is the mark of the child of God. But the sealing has a reference to the end of the age, for God will deliver all those who have His stamp on them (cf. Rev. 7:4).</p>
<p>
The background for the concept of sealing may be seen in tattooing, or in the marking of Cain, or in the marking of Jewish house with blood at the first Passover, or in the marking of the foreheads of the faithful before the judgement (Ezek 9). The seal of the old covenant, circumcision, must also be taken into account. It is not surprising, since the believers are incorporated into the Christian community by baptism (which is often related to the work of the Spirit), that baptism came to be known as sealing. It does not follow, however, that whenever Paul speaks of the sealing with the Spirit that baptism is meant, as Professor Kirby insists. That sealing has reference to confirmation is just as unconvincing. </p>
<p>
That the sealing with the Spirit is an assurance of the hope of the believer can be seen in that sealing is used in conjunction with the earnest (down payment) of the Spirit (2 Cor. 1:21f.). It is even more explicitly stated in Eph 1:13-14: <dr class="alt5">“In Him you also trusted, after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession” (Eph 1:13-14)</dr class="alt5">. It is worth noticing here that the sealing with the Spirit takes place when men give ear to the word of truth, the Gospel.</p>
<p>
That the sealing has an eschatological reference is borne out even more clearly in Eph. 4, where the apostle informs us that we were sealed with the Spirit <dr class="alt5">“for the day of redemption.” (Eph. 4:30)</dr class="alt5">. The Christ-event, which lies in the past, is made real for us by the Spirit, which also assures us that final redemption awaits us at the end of this age. This word of assurance, however, is coupled with the admonition <dr class="alt5">“do not grieve the Holy Spirit!” (Eph. 4:30)<.dr class="alt5"> Perhaps this is a word of caution not to understand the sealing with the Spirit mechanically, as teaching the unconditional eternal security of the believer.</p>
<p>
The Earnest of the Spirit. In two of the three passages which speak of the sealing with the Spirit, the Spirit is called the pledge. If we add 2 Cor. 5:5 to 2 Cor. 1:22 and Eph. 1:14, we have the three passages in which the Spirit is spoken of as the earnest.  In Gen. 38:17, 18 and 20 the substantive is used for the pledge which Judah gave Tamar. As a rule the word occurs as a verb in the Old Testament, but always with the basic idea of surety or guarantee. Nowhere, however, does it signify the partial payment of a money debt. It is as a loan-word in Greek that earnest-money becomes more than a pledge; it is a partial down payment. A pledge is taken back when the contract is fulfilled, but earnest money is payment in advance of full payment. </p>
<p>
To say that God has given us the pledge of the Spirit (2 Cor. 1:22; 5:5) means that the Spirit is only a foretaste of the fullness that is to come. Eph. 1:14 says essentially the same thing. Pledge, then, reflects the tension between the already and the not yet of the believer’s experience in the present. The life of the believer in this age is marked by incompleteness with respect to knowledge, communion with God, and power and freedom in Christian living. The desire for eternal life has not yet been fulfilled. It is on these levels that the Spirit gives anticipation of completeness and fullness.</p>  
<p>
The First fruits of the Spirit. Intimately related to the concept of the Spirit as earnest is that of first fruits. The background for the metaphor is to be found in the Israelitic cult, where the first fruits were offered and consecrated to God (Lev. 2:12; Deut. 26:1-11; Ezek. 45:1). The first fruits were the guarantee that the full harvest would follow, and it is this aspect of the practice that Paul has in mind when he speaks of the Spirit as first fruits. Through the Spirit the life of the age to come has been made available to us in the midst of the decay and death of this present evil age, but we are not yet experiencing the harvest of the new age, just the first fruits. Since the harvest still lies in the future, the believers groan with the rest of creation; they experience the birth pangs of the messianic age (Rom. 8:22). “<dr class="alt5">but we also who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body.” (Rom. 8:23)</dr class="alt5">. The life of the Spirit here on earth does not exhaust the fullness of God’s redemptive gifts, for we share the bondage to decay which afflicts all creation. But the Spirit is the guarantee that when our bodies are redeemed we will share in all the fullness of the age to come.</p>
<p>
Spirit and Son ship. Paul informs us that <dr class="alt5">“The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,” (Rom. 8:16)</dr class="alt5">. Does this mean that God’s Spirit witnesses conjointly with our own consciousness to the fact that we are God’s?  “Certitude of being a child of God does not rest on the testimony of our spirit but uniquely on the testimony of God’s Spirit.”  But how does He give that certitude if not by corroborating our inner conviction that God has made His children? Also, it appears to be overly precise to say that the witness which the Spirit gives our spirit is audibly expressed in the cry Abba, Father. Although son ship is expressed in prayer to the Father, the Spirit witnesses with our spirit by reminding us of God’s love for us, of His promises and by making all the great verities of Christ’s redeeming grace real to us.</p>
<p>
Although son ship is a present possession, it is also a hope; <dr class="alt5">“waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body.” (Rom. 8:23)</dr class="alt5">. Final acceptance into God’s family is the Christian’s hope—a hope that will be realised when the physical gives way to the spiritual (1 Cor. 15:44f.).

5. The Spirit and the Love of God. What makes the Christian hope so strong that it bears the believer up in trials and tribulations? (Rom. 5:2-4).<dr class="alt5"> It is because God’s love has been poured into his heart by the Holy Spirit (Rom. 5:5)</dr class="alt5">. The Holy Spirit gives the believer the assurance that God’s love has been demonstrated in all its fulness in Christ. The Spirit draws men into fellowship with Christ so that the demonstration of His love for sinners is not merely an historical event but a living reality.

6. The Spirit and the Resurrection. In Rom. 8:11 Paul avers that the Spirit which indwells the believers is their assurance that God will raise their mortal bodies. Perhaps the passage is reminiscent of Ezek 37,<dr class="alt5"> “I will put my Spirit in you, and you shall live.” (Ezek 37:14)</dr class="alt5">

In 1 Cor 15 <dr class="alt5">“The first man Adam became a living being.” The last Adam became a life-giving spirit. (1 Cor 15:45)</dr class="alt5">. Implied is that those who belong to Him will experience a similar transition from their earthly to their heavenly existence, and will receive a ‘spiritual body’.

We notice, then, that the Holy Spirit is not only the sign of the arrival of the new age, but He is the believer’s assurance of the consummation of the age. The Christian hope is suspended, as it were, between two poles of deliverance—that already attained in Christ, and the other still in the future. The Spirit gives substance to this hope.
<h2>
The Spirit and the Substance of Hope.
</h2>
<p>
1. The Spirit and the Redemption of the Body. We have already observed that the Spirit has sealed the people of God <dr class="alt5">“for the day of redemption” (Eph. 4:30)</dr class="alt5">. Although we sigh with anxiety because we are still in this age, we have the hope that what is mortal will be swallowed up by life. “He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee” (2 Cor. 5:4ff.). Assured of the supply of <dr class="alt5">the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19)</dr class="alt5">, Paul could stare death in the face. The Spirit assures us of the redemption of our bodies</p>
<p>

2. The Spirit and Righteousness. Although we have already been justified, <dr class="alt5">“we through the Spirit eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness by faith.” (Gal 5:5)</dr class="alt5">. The believer’s hope of final acquittal before God comes by the work of the Spirit. Of course God’s work never rules out our response, and so Paul adds “by faith.” In contrast to Judaism where justification was thought of as taking place in the end, and where it depended on whether the good works outweighed the bad, Paul argues (particularly in Romans) that justification is a present possession and comes to us as a gift of God’s grace. But, in agreement with Judaism, Paul holds to a judgement that takes place at the end of the age. 

3. The Spirit and Glory. ‘Glory’ is an eschatological term associated several times with ‘Spirit’. This glory, which is enjoyed by the believer in anticipation in this age, will be experienced to the full in the future. <dr class="alt5">But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord (2 Cor. 3:18)</dr class="alt5">. Although this passage speaks of the present experience of glory in the life of the believer, the Spirit also lets him have a foretaste of <dr class="alt5">the glory which shall be revealed in us. (Rom.8:18)</dr class="alt5">.<dr class="alt5"> God who calls you into His own kingdom and glory. (1 Thess. 2:12)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
The Spirit and the Future Kingdom. In contrast to the Gospels, where kingdom occurs some 128 times, the word occurs only 32 times in all the rest of the New Testament.  When the word kingdom is used by Paul (e.g., 1 Cor. 6:9; 6:10; 15:50; Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5), it usually has a futuristic reference, although it is also seen as a present reality (e.g. Col. 1:13; 1 Cor. 4:20; Rom. 14:17). In Rom 14 the kingdom of God is defined as righteousness and peace and joy “in the Holy Spirit.” (Rom 14:17)</dr class="alt5"> These eschatological gifts, says Paul, are more important than arguments about food and drink. From this we can see that although the kingdom of God is an object of hope, the church is already drawn into its incomprehensible power by the Holy Spirit. At the same time the church continues to pray as her Lord taught her, “Thy kingdom come.”</p>
<p>
The Spirit and Eternal Life. According to the Old Testament, God’s Spirit gives and sustains all life. It is not surprising, then, that the bestowal of life should be the central function of the Spirit in the new age. (Reference may be made here to the valley of corpses in Ezekiel’s vision which are revitalised by the Spirit of Yahweh—a passage which in Judaism had eschatological significance.) In contrast to the rabbis who taught that the Torah gave life eternal (cf. John 5:29), Paul claims that life is the gift of the Spirit (e.g., Rom. 8:2, 9, 10). Although this life is already experienced in this evil age, eternal life is also a hope, for in this age our life is hidden (Col. 3:4). It is by the Spirit that we reap eternal life (Gal. 6:6). In this brief survey we have tried to show that Spirit is an eschatological concept. What Paul says about the Spirit consistently reflects a polarity of the already and the not yet. This dialectic of the fulfilled and the unfulfilled characterises the Christ-event which lies in the past; it explains the tension in which the church lives in the present—the interim between the cross and the the coming of Christ on Judgement Day. It is also basic to Paul’s understanding of the Christian hope, the the coming of Christ , which still lies in the future. The connection between the present (the era of the church), and the past (the death and resurrection of Christ), as well as the connection between the past and present with the future (the the coming of Christ) is made meaningful through the work of the Spirit. The solution of the polarity between present and futuristic eschatology lies in the doctrine of the Spirit, for the Spirit is both the sign of the new age, and the guarantee that the One who has begun the good work will complete it on the Day of Christ.
