  <h1>
Salvation (Theology)
</h1>
<p>
According to dictionary definitions, salvation has four meanings.</p> 
<p> 
It can be defined as the act of saving or protecting from harm, risk, loss and destruction;</p>
<p> 
The state of being saved or protected from harm and risk; a source, cause, or means of being saved or protected from harm and risk, or </p>
<p>Its meaning in theology is deliverance from the power and penalty of sin.</p>
<h3>
Christian salvation
</h3>
<p>
In Christianity, salvation is the deliverance from sin, spiritual death and divine punishment.<br> 
The theological study of salvation is called soteriology, which deals with the doctrines of redemption and atonement. It also explains the meaning of salvation and the means by which it is achieved. The word "salvation" originates from the early 13th century and derives from the Latin word salus.
<br> In Christianity, Jesus is seen as the source of salvation. Christians believe that human life is marked by suffering, illness, violence and death. This situation is neither desirable nor natural, hence the need for salvation. 
<br>The cause for humanity's problems is sin. It is the disobedience of both God's external commands and the individual's internal awareness of good and evil: <dr class="alt5"> the day when God will judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ (Rom 2:14-16).</dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
Original sin
</h3>
<p>
Most Christians believe that it was the sin of Adam and Eve that brought physical death into the world and perhaps also natural disasters and illness. For everyone after Adam and Eve, sin leads to sorrow, suffering and violence. Even more importantly, however, sin results in separation from God, both in this life and the next. 
<br>According to Christian teachings, God is good, perfect and just. Therefore sinners cannot enjoy the full benefits of knowing God in this life, such as peace, comfort and help in times of trouble. They cannot spend eternity in God's presence, meaning that their soul will either be annihilated at death or will suffer eternally in the state or place known as Hell.</p>
<h3>
Atonement through Christ
</h3>
<p>
Christians believe that salvation was made possible by the sacrificial death of Christ by crucifixion. The word "atonement" - one of the few theological words of English origin - is used to describe this concept. The verb "atone" derives from the adverb "at one," and therefore means "to reconcile." The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church describes "atonement" as "man's reconciliation with God through the sacrificial death of Christ." The death of Christ on the cross is seen not just as a historical tragedy but as the basis for salvation from sin.</p>
<p>
The nature of salvation has been understood in various ways throughout Christian history. There are four major perspectives on the meaning of Christian salvation: deification, righteousness, authentic human existence and liberation. The notion of deification (Theosis in Greek) is based on the perspective that when Christ was incarnate as the man Jesus, He did not take on just one human nature but all of human nature. He made it possible for the reverse to occur, for humans to participate in the divine nature. Salvation is also viewed as the imputed righteousness of Jesus Christ on believers. During the Enlightenment, the idea of "authentic existence" had considerable importance.</p>
<p>
New Testament authors and other Christian theologians believe that individuals must repent, believe and otherwise work for their own salvation. They also argue that salvation is not entirely a human enterprise as God takes an active role, helping humans to be saved through his grace. Some Christians have even taught that humans are so helpless in their state of sin that God most do all the work, or at least take the first step. This raises the complicated issue of how human free will and effort relates to God's grace and predestination.</p>
