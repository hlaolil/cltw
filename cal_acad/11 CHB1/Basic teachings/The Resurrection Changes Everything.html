   <h1>
The Resurrection Changes Everything
</h1>
<h3>
The Changes
</h3>
<p>
Jesus’ resurrection does not only change us by saving our souls, making us holy, and filling us with power to live.

The fact that it changes our bodies to be immortal is still not the most glorious aspect of the story of salvation. Often the gospel is spoken of as being a great arc leading from the creation to the Fall to the Incarnation to the death of Jesus and then His resurrection and ascension. But that arc is not yet complete. Jesus will return, and when He does, the resurrection really will change everything.</p>
<p>
The Bible tells us, <dr class="alt5">“whom heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began.” (Acts 3:21)</dr class="alt5">.<br> Paul tells us that God has <dr class="alt5">“purposed in Himself, that in the dispensation of the fullness of the times He might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth” (Eph 1:9–10)</dr class="alt5">. <br>There will be no more rebellion. Only then will this tiny rebellious corner of the universe we call earth resound with the praise of Jesus’ glory.</p>
<p>
If this regeneration or resurrection of all things means anything, it means the reversal of the effects of death. Death entered the world through mankind: <dr class="alt5">“through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death spread to all men, because all sinned—” (Rom 5:12)</dr class="alt5">. <br>As a result of one man’s sin, the whole of creation was delivered up to bondage and decay. But all is not lost. This process has begun to be reversed as a result of the actions of one man, Jesus.</p>
<h3>
The Power that raised Christ
</h3>
<p>
Christians have the same power that raised Christ Jesus from the dead living inside them.

One day that power will complete the work of saving us, but in the meantime the normal Christian life can be one in which we are very aware of the change that the resurrection brings.<br> We are citizens of the age to come, living in a world that is dead to God. <br>But we are not dead to Him. We live to Him. May God help us live in the light of that fact more each day. One day we will all see that, thanks to the death and resurrection of Jesus, everything really has been changed. <br>The whole creation will have been renewed, and we will be like Him.</p>
<h3>
Paul’s prayer
</h3>
<p>
I can think of no better way to end than with Paul’s prayer that speaks of the work of the Spirit, of the hope Jesus’ resurrection has given us, the power of His resurrection and of the coming kingdom in which He rules.<br> May God answer this prayer in our lives and so help us to truly believe in the physical resurrection of Jesus Christ and live in light of the implications of that event.</p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of Him, the eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of His calling, what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the working of His mighty power which He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come. (Eph 1:17–21)</dr class="alt5">
