Eternal punishment or Eternal torment

<h3>
The Reality of Hell
</h3>
<p>
The Bible presents Hell, like Heaven, as a real place. The Bible says that God created this terrible place to serve as the ultimate destiny of the Devil and his angels (Matthew 25:41). The Bible also teaches that Hell will be the destiny of all people who reject the grace and mercy God has provided through Jesus and who choose, instead, to follow Satan (Matt 25:46).
Hell is described in the Scriptures as a place of darkness and sadness (Matt 22:13), a place of fire (Matt 5:22), a place of torment (Rev 14: 10), a place of destruction (Matt 7:13), and a place of disgrace and everlasting contempt (Dan 12:2).</p>
<h3>
Its Distinction from Hades
</h3>
<p>
Hell is not Hades. A careful study of the Scriptures will reveal that Hades in the New Testament is the same place as Sheol in the Old Testament (Psalm 49:15).
Before the Cross, Hades (or Sheol) was the holding place for the spirits of the dead who awaited their resurrection, judgement, and ultimate consignment to Heaven or Hell. According to Jesus' story of the rich man and Lazarus (Luke 16:19-31), Hades was composed of two compartments — Paradise and Torments. At death, the spirits of the righteous (those who had put their faith in God) went to a compartment in Hades called Paradise. The unrighteous went to a compartment called Torments. The two compartments were separated by a wide gulf that could not be crossed.
The Bible indicates that the nature of Hades was radically changed at the time of the Cross. After His death on the Cross, Jesus descended into Hades and declared to all the spirits there His triumph over Satan through the shedding of His blood for the sins of Mankind (1 Peter 3:18-19; 4:6).
The Bible also indicates that after His resurrection, when He ascended to Heaven, Jesus took Paradise with Him, transferring the spirits of the righteous dead from Hades to Heaven (Eph 4:8-9 and 2 Cor 12:1-4). The spirits of the righteous dead are thereafter pictured as being in Heaven before the throne of God (Revelation 6:9 and 7:9).
Thus, since the time of the Cross, the spirits of dead saints no longer go to Hades. They are taken, instead, directly to Heaven. The spirits of Old Testament saints could not go directly to Heaven because their sins had not been forgiven. Their sins had only been covered, so to speak, by their faith. Their sins could not be forgiven until Jesus shed His blood for them on the Cross.
The souls of the unrighteous dead will remain in Hades until the end of the millennial reign of Jesus. At that time they will be resurrected and judged at the Great White Throne judgement portrayed in Revelation 20:11-15. They will be judged by their works, and since no person can be justified before God by works (Ephesians 2:8-10), all the unrighteous will be cast into Hell, which the passage in Revelation refers to as "the lake of fire" (Revelation 20:14).</p>
<h3>
The Duration of Hell
</h3>
<p>
How long will the unrighteous be tormented in Hell? The traditional view holds that Hell is a place of eternal, conscious torment. According to this view, a person who ends up in Hell is doomed to a never-ending existence of excruciating pain and suffering. Hell is a place of no escape and no hope.
Another point of view — the one I hold — takes the position that immortality is conditional, depending upon one's acceptance of Christ. I believe the Bible teaches the unrighteous will be resurrected, judged, punished in Hell for a period of time proportional to their sins, and then suffer destruction (the death of body and soul).
In a moment we will take a brief look at both views, but before we do, I would like to remind us all of a sobering truth: Hell is a reality, and it is a dreadful destiny. Hell exists because God cannot be mocked (Gal 6:7). He is going to deal with sin, and He deals with sin in one of two ways — either grace or wrath. John 3:36 says, "He who believes in the Son has eternal life; but he who does not obey the son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him."
Whatever we conclude from the Scriptures about the duration of Hell, we must remember that Hell is to be avoided at all costs. Whether the wicked suffer there eternally or are destroyed after enduring God's terrible punishment, Hell is an unimaginably terrifying place.
We must also remember that our beliefs about the duration of Hell are not on the plane of cardinal doctrine. Sincere, godly Christians may study the same scripture passages about Hell and end up with differing conclusions about the issue of its duration. Our varied viewpoints, arrived at through earnest and godly study, should not be allowed to cause division or rancour in the body of Christ.</p>
<h3>
The Traditional Viewpoint
</h3>
<p>
Few traditionalists are happy about the doctrine of the eternal torment of the wicked, but they accept it anyway because they believe it to be biblical. In this they are to be commended.
Most point to scriptures such as Matt 25:46 for support: "Then these [the wicked] will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life." Since the word "eternal" is used of both the wicked and the righteous, they conclude that the punishment must be eternal in the same way that the life is.
Many traditionalists also cite Rev 20:10 — a verse specifically about the Devil, the Antichrist and the False Prophet — to prove that a God of love can indeed sentence at least some of His creatures to eternal torment: "And the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are also; and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever." If it is possible for God to treat one set of His creatures in this way, they reason, why should it be impossible for Him to do the same thing with another set?
Still another Revelation passage also figures in the traditionalist argument. Rev 14 reads:
And another angel, a third one, followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If anyone worships the beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead or upon his hand, he also will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed in full strength in the cup of His anger; and he will be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name." (Rev 14:9-11)</dr class="alt5">
Traditionalists notice that not only are these unbelievers tossed into the lake of fire where "the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever," but they have no rest "day or night." This is in stark contrast to the saved, who will enjoy rest eternally (Revelation 14: 13). To traditionalists, both the "rest" of believers and the "unrest" of unbelievers seem to imply a conscious state.
Other Traditionalist Arguments
In other parts of the Bible, several passages which talk about Hell use the word "destroy" or "destruction" to describe what happens to the unrighteous. Traditionalists claim that the picture in these passages is not of obliteration but of a ruin of human life out of God's presence forever. In this way they are able to conceive of a "destruction" which lasts forever.
A more philosophical traditionalist argument concerns Mankind's creation in the image of God. Some traditionalists believe that the torments of Hell must be eternal, since humankind was made in the image of God and that image cannot be "uncreated." Thus they believe that immortality was bestowed on Mankind when God created male and female in His image.
Last, many traditionalists believe that Hell must be eternal because of the nature of sin itself. All sin is an offence against God, goes this argument, and since God is infinite, all sin is infinitely odious. Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758), the great Puritan theologian, took this line of argument in his famous sermon, "The Justice of God in the Damnation of Sinners."
As you can see, these arguments seem both biblical and substantial. And yet they are not without significant problems. Allow me to explain why I believe the conditionalist (the doctrine that divine grace and immortality are conditional) approach is a better solution to the difficulty.</p>
<h3>
The Conditionalist Viewpoint
</h3>
<p>
The doctrine of the duration of Hell has been so strongly held throughout the history of Christianity that few have dared to challenge it. Adding to the reluctance has been the fact that most modern challenges have come from the cults. Thus, a person who dares to question the traditional viewpoint runs the risk of being labelled a cultist.
A classic characteristic of modern-day "Christian" cults is their denial of the reality of Hell. Some argue that everyone will be saved. Most take the position that the unrighteous are annihilated at physical death.
The views of the cults regarding Hell have always been repulsive to me because they deny the clear teaching of Scripture that the unrighteous will be sent to a place of suffering called Hell. Yet, I have never been able to fully embrace the traditional viewpoint of conscious, eternal punishment.</p>
<h3>
Traditionalist Difficulties
</h3>
<p>
My first difficulty with the traditional view is that it seems to impugn the character of God. I kept asking myself, "How could a God of grace, mercy and love torment the vast majority of humanity eternally?" It did not seem to me to be either loving or just. I realize He is a God of righteousness, holiness and justice, but is eternal suffering justice? The concept of eternal torment seems to convert the true God of justice into a cosmic sadist.
Second, the concept of eternal torment seems to run contrary to biblical examples. God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah with fire — suddenly and quickly. He destroyed Noah's evil world with water — suddenly and quickly. He ordered the Canaanites to be killed swiftly. In the Law of Moses there was no provision for incarceration or torture. Punishments for violation of the Law consisted either of restitution or death. Even sacrificial animals were spared suffering through precise prescriptions for their killing that guaranteed a death that would be as quick and painless as possible.
As a student of God's Prophetic Word, I found a third problem with the traditional view. It seems to contradict a descriptive phrase that is used in prophecy to describe Hell. That term is "the second death." It is a term peculiar to the book of Revelation (Revelation 2:11; 20:6, 14; 21:8). How can Hell be a "second death" if it consists of eternal, conscious torment?</p>
<h3>
The Problem of Destruction
</h3>
<p>
A fourth reason the traditional view has always troubled me is that it seems to ignore an important biblical teaching about Hell; namely, that Hell is a place of destruction. Jesus Himself spoke of Hell as a place of "destruction" (Matt 7:13). Further, in Matthew 10:28 Jesus said: "Do not fear those who kill the body, but are unable to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Hell."
Likewise, in 2 Thessalonians 1:9 Paul says that those who do not obey the gospel "will pay the penalty of eternal destruction." The writer of Hebrews says that the unrighteous will experience a terrifying judgement that will result in their consumption by fire (Hebrews 10:27). Even one of the most comforting verses in the Bible speaks of the destruction of the unrighteous: "For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life" (John 3:16).
The traditionalist argument that the word "destroy" or "destruction" should be interpreted as "irreparable loss" seems a stretch to me. It seems much more likely that "destroy" should be taken to mean exactly that.</p>
<h3>
The Meaning of Punishment
</h3>
<p>
Fifth, there is a difference between eternal punishment and eternal punishing. It is one thing to experience a punishment that is eternal in its consequences; it is another thing to experience eternal punishing.
The Bible also speaks of eternal judgement (Hebrews 6:2). Is that a judgement that continues eternally, or is it a judgement with eternal consequences? Likewise, the Bible speaks of eternal redemption (Hebrews 9:12). But this does not mean that Christ will continue the act of redemption eternally. That act took place at the Cross, once and for all. It was an eternal redemption because the result of the redemption had eternal consequences.</p>
<h3>
Symbolism
</h3>
<p>
Sixth, I noted earlier that traditionalists often cite Revelation 14:9-11 to demonstrate that the suffering of the wicked will be eternal. They most often highlight two phrases. The first refers to those who take the mark of the beast during the Tribulation, who will be "tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels." The second is that "the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever." Notice that this passage does not speak of eternal torment. Rather, it speaks of "the smoke of their torment" ascending forever.
The Bible is its own best interpreter, and when you look up statements similar to this you will find that they are symbolic for a punishment that has eternal consequences, not a punishment that continues eternally. For example, consider Isaiah 34:10 which speaks of the destruction of Edom. It says the smoke of Edom's destruction will "go up forever."
I have been to Edom (the southern portion of modern day Jordan in the area around Petra). I have seen its destruction. But there was no smoke ascending to heaven. The reference to eternal smoke is obviously symbolic, indicating that Edom's destruction will give eternal testimony to how God deals with a sinful society.
The same is true of Jude 7 when it says that Sodom and Gomorrah experienced "the punishment of eternal fire." Again, I have been to the area at the southern tip of the Dead Sea where these twin cities existed. The area is one of utter devastation, but there is no smoke going up to heaven. They are not burning eternally. They simply suffered a fiery destruction that had eternal consequences.</p>
<h3>
Immortality
</h3>
<p>
Seventh, many traditionalists believe that the soul is immortal. But is it? I believe the Bible denies the immortality of the soul point blank.
In 1 Timothy 6:15-16 Paul says that God alone possesses immortality. And 1 Corinthians 15:53 teaches that the Redeemed will not become immortal until the time of their resurrection.
In other words, immortality is a gift of God which He gives in His grace to the Redeemed at the time of their resurrection. There is no need to believe in an eternal Hell if the soul is not intrinsically immortal. And it isn't.</p>
<h3>
The Example of Jesus
</h3>
<p>
Finally, to me personally, the most convincing of all arguments against the traditionalist viewpoint relates to what Jesus Himself suffered on the Cross. Our sins were placed upon Him. He took the punishment we deserve.
And what was that punishment? It was extreme suffering followed by death. If Jesus did not suffer the full penalty for our sins, then our debt has not been paid. But the Scriptures say that He paid the full debt, and it was not eternal torment.</p>
<h3>
A Summary
</h3>
<p>
You should see by now that both the traditional and conditional positions on Hell can muster good, biblical support for their point of view. We are not talking here about a biblical view versus an unbiblical one.
In defining any doctrine, everything the Bible has to say about the issue must be considered. Concerning the issue of Hell, the only way I have been able to incorporate all that the Bible has to say is to conclude:
Those who die outside a faith relationship with Jesus are initially confined to a compartment in Hades called Torments.
At the end of the Millennium, they will be resurrected and judged of their works by Jesus at the Great White Throne Judgement.
All of them will be condemned to Hell because no one can be justified before God by their works.
They will be cast into the lake of fire (Hell) where they will suffer a time of torment in proportion to their sins.
They will then experience the "second death" (death of body, soul and spirit).</p>
<h3>
The Reality of Hell
</h3>
<p>
Which viewpoint is right — the traditional one or the conditionalist concept? I have cast my vote for the conditionalist understanding. You may decide that the evidence points in the other direction. That's okay. The important thing to keep in mind is that Hell is a reality, and regardless of its specific nature, it is a terrible destiny.
And because it is a horrible reality, it needs to be preached. People need to know the consequence of rejecting God's love, grace, and mercy.
The story has been told of C. S. Lewis listening to a young preacher's sermon on the subject of God's judgement on sin. At the end of his message, the young man said: "If you do not receive Christ as Savior, you will suffer grave eschatological ramifications!"
After the service, Lewis asked him, "Do you mean that person who doesn't believe in Christ will go to Hell?"
"Precisely," the young preacher responded.
"Then say so," Lewis replied.
The stakes are too great to beat around the bush.</p>
<h3>
Questions and Answers About the Conditional View of Hell
</h3>
<p>
1) Doesn't the story of the rich man and Lazarus in Luke 16:19-31 teach eternal torment in Hell?
No, it does not. In fact, eternal torment is not even mentioned. Furthermore, the story has nothing to do with Hell. It is a depiction of Hades as it existed before the Cross, when Paradise was still one of its compartments.
The confusion stems from the fact that some translations state in verse 23 that the rich man was in Hell. That is incorrect. The actual word used in the Greek text is Hades and not Gehenna, the word for Hell.
When unsaved people die, their souls go to a compartment in Hades called Torments where they are subjected to suffering. That particular suffering will come to an end at the conclusion of the Millennial reign of Jesus. At that time He will judge those who are in Hades and consign them to Hell (Revelation 20:11-15). We are told that Hades will be cast into the "lake of fire," which is Hell (Revelation 20:14).
For those who have suffered for lengthy times in Hades, their suffering may well end instantly when they are consigned to Hell where they will experience "eternal destruction" (2 Thessalonians 1:9). Others will likely continue to suffer for a period of time in Hell before they "perish" (John 3:16).
The Bible clearly teaches that there will be degrees of punishment, so some will suffer longer and more intensely than others (Luke 12:35-48, Luke 20:45-47, and Hebrews 10:29).
2) Didn't Jesus teach eternal torment when He said that Hell is a place "where their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched?" (Mark 9:48)
Jesus could not have been teaching eternal torment when He made this statement because He was quoting Isaiah 66:24 which says that the redeemed will be able to view the corpses of those who are lost. The phraseology about the worm and the fire is figurative language that emphasizes the fact that the testimony of what happens to unrepentant sinners will never die.
Similar wording is used about the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. Jude 7 tells us that these cities experienced "the punishment of eternal fire." That does not mean an eternally burning fire; rather, it speaks of a fire with eternal consequences.
3) What about those during the Tribulation who take the mark of the beast? Doesn't the Bible say they will be tormented forever? (Revelation 14:9-11)
Again, there is no mention of eternal torment in these verses. We are told that they will "be tormented in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb" (Revelation 14:10), but no duration of this torment is given. To conclude that the torment will continue eternally, one would have to assume that the soul is immortal. But the Bible denies the immortality of the soul (1 Timothy 6:13-16).
The passage does say that "the smoke of their torment will go up forever," but that is a figurative expression that denotes an eternal witness of their fate. For example, we are told in Isaiah 34:10 that the smoke from Edom's destruction will rise forever. There is no such smoke rising from Edom today except in the sense that we have the memory of its destruction.
4) What about the Antichrist and the False Prophet? Doesn't the Bible say they will be subjected to eternal torment? (Revelation 19:20 and 20:10).
Yes, Revelation 20:10 states that the Antichrist and his False Prophet will "be tormented forever and ever," together with Satan. But this certainly is no indication that the rest of humanity will suffer eternal torment.
The Antichrist and False Prophet are two special cases. Keep in mind that they will be responsible for the deaths of one-half of humanity during the first three-and-a-half years of the Tribulation. That's a total of 3 billion people in today's terms. They are also going to kill two-thirds of the Jews during the second half of the Tribulation. By the end of the seven years of the Tribulation, it is likely that they will have the blood of two-thirds of humanity on their hands — or 4 billion people. All the carnage of all the nefarious leaders of history — like Hitler, Stalin, and Mao — pales in comparison.
But it may well be that Revelation 20:10 is not speaking of the human beings who will serve as the Antichrist and False Prophet. It may instead be speaking of the demonic spirits that possess them. Note that the passage refers to "the beast and the false prophet." We are told in Revelation 11:7 that the beast "comes up out of the abyss." According to the Scriptures, this is the pit where evil spirits are imprisoned, not human beings. Likewise, the False Prophet is referred to as "another beast" (Revelation 13:11), meaning another of the same kind.
5) Won't the Conditional viewpoint motivate people to ignore God?
Let me quote Edward Fudge's answer to this question: "Only if their only reason for serving God is the belief that He will inflict on the wicked a torture unimaginably worse than the most monstrous tyrant among men ever dreamed of inflicting on his victims. The truth is that the traditional doctrine of everlasting torture in Hell has created more atheists than almost anything else Christians have ever taught... What the Conditionalist view does is magnify the justice of God (each doomed sinner receives precisely what he or she deserves and nothing else), the mercy of God (even the worst sinner finally perishes forever), and the holiness of God (His wrath is real, but it is measured with exact precision in keeping with His own character)."
6) Doesn't the Conditionalist viewpoint require a lot of spiritualisation of the Scriptures?
Not at all. In fact, it is the traditional view of everlasting torment that requires the most spiritualisation. Those who hold to the traditional concept must spiritualise such words and phrases as "perish," "destruction," "consumed by fire," and "second death."
The Conditionalist view requires only the spiritualisation of figurative expressions like "their worm will not die" and "the smoke of their torment will go up forever."
7) Don't the cults hold the Conditionalist viewpoint?
Many, like the Jehovah's Witnesses, believe that the souls of sinners are annihilated at death, but that is not the Conditionalist position. A marginal group, The Seventh Day Adventists, does embrace Conditionalism, but their endorsement of it no more invalidates it than does their endorsement of the Trinity invalidate that thoroughly biblical concept.
8) What do you consider to be the single most powerful argument against the traditional concept of eternal torment in Hell?
The fact that we are told that Jesus paid the price for our sins. What was that price? It was suffering and death, not eternal torment. Unrepentant sinners will therefore experience what Jesus experienced: suffering and death (the "Second Death").
The bottom line is that because of a preconceived, unbiblical notion that the soul is immortal, we have read eternal torment into the Scriptures when it was never intended for Mankind. Hell was created for Satan and his angels, not for Mankind, and it is Satan and his demonic hordes who will be consigned to Hell and its torments eternally.
