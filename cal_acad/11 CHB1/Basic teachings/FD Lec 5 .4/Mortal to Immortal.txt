<h3>
Thinking about the "new body"
</h3>
<p>
So what kind of bodies will God provide for us in the resurrection? Paul answered the question by explaining the process with the help of another analogy from the natural world:<dr class="alt5"> "what you sow is not made alive unless it dies. And what you sow, you do not sow that body that shall be, but mere grain— perhaps wheat or some other grain" (1 Cor 15:36-37</dr class="alt5">).
Yes, that is a marvel. A field of wheat from a handful of seeds. A mighty oak tree coming from a tiny acorn! A worm buried in a tomb-like cocoon reappears as a different life form, with a totally different body.</p>
<p>
That’s analogous to what will happen to us in the resurrection of the dead. Paul explains: "It is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power. It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body." (1 Cor 15:43-44).</p>
<p>
The metamorphosed body we are to receive will be a "spiritual body." Paul didn’t say we receive a non material, spirit body, but a "spiritual body." to exist in a manner corresponding with or appropriate to the Spirit. That doesn’t tell us anything specific about the make-up of spiritual bodies.</p>
<p>
Another apostle, John, also understood that there’s no explaining what our metamorphosed bodies or life will be like in the resurrection except in general terms: " Beloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is." (1 John 3:2).</p>
<h3>
The same but not the same
</h3>
<p>
Our post-resurrection "spiritual" existence will be decisively different from our present fleshly, earthly existence. Yet, a singular continuity will exist within this fundamental discontinuity. We will still be ourselves "on the other side," but fully regenerated in nature and immortal in body.</p>
<h3>
New bodies for old
</h3>
<p>
So what is it exactly that our changed — metamorphosed — new bodies will have that they do not possess now? Paul again explains: <dr class="alt5">"Behold, I tell you a mystery: ... the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality." (1 Cor 15:50-53)</dr class="alt5">. Yes, the mortal will be clothed with or put on immortality. Continuity, but also fundamental discontinuity.</p>
<p>
Resurrection bodies will be imperishable and immortal. Think about it. None of our present fleshly weaknesses will exist. Never to be tired. Never to be thirsty or hungry. Never to be sick and in pain. Never to suffer from anxieties and fears. Never to sin. Never to die.</p>
<p>
Paul knew what it meant to suffer deprivation and pain in this temporal, physical body, which is our present heritage. He longed to rest in peace, waiting for the resurrection: <dr class="alt5">"For we know that if our earthly house, this tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. For in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven, if indeed, having been clothed, we shall not be found naked. For we who are in this tent groan, being burdened, not because we want to be unclothed, but further clothed, that mortality may be swallowed up by life." (2 Cor 5:1-4)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
The book of Revelation exults in this time after the resurrection, when we will have new bodies: <dr class="alt5">"God Himself will be with them and be their God. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain, for the former things have passed away" (Rev 21:3-4)</dr class="alt5">. God’s gift to us of a new spiritual and immortal body and a mind and heart regenerated and perfected through Christ and in the Holy Spirit will make all this possible.</p>
<p>
Scripture testifies to our human experience that physical human bodies grow old and infirm, become sick and pained, decay and die. It also testifies that in the resurrection we will receive a new body from God that will give us true and eternal freedom and joy. <dr class="alt5">"creation itself also will be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know that the whole creation groans and labours with birth pangs together until now. Not only that, but we also who have the first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body." (Rom 8:21-23)</dr class="alt5">.
