   <h1>
The Kingdom Of Heaven 
</h1>
<p>
The Kingdom of Heaven (literally, the Kingdom from the Heavens) is a term used only in Matthew’s Gospel to represent the realm of professing Christians from the time of the beginning of Jesus’ public ministry (Matthew 4:17), through to the present, and forward to the time of His second coming.</p>
<h3>
What the Kingdom Of Heaven is 
</h3>
<p>
The Kingdom of Heaven is different than the Kingdom of God.  These are not inter-changeable terms, as many suggest.  The Kingdom of Heaven is an imperfect, earthly realm, inhabited by both the good and the bad. <br> This is illustrated in many of Jesus’ parables, which begin with the phrase <dr class="alt5"><br>“the Kingdom of Heaven is like...” </dr class="alt5"> In these parables there is a comparison made between those who will enter the place of blessing or celebration, and those who are sent to a place of everlasting punishment (the wheat is gathered to the Master’s barn, but the weeds are burned; the wise virgins go in to the marriage feast, but the foolish virgins are denied entrance; the good fish are separated from the worthless fish, so the worthless can be cast aside; and so on).  <br><i>The Kingdom of Heaven actually precedes the final fulfilment of the Kingdom of God.</i> </p>
<p>
Therefore, the things Jesus taught regarding the Kingdom of Heaven apply to this age.  <br>This is important, because His teaching exposes current deceptions in the church.  In groups that many would consider liberal, the deception is that God is a benevolent Being, willing to accept all who make an attempt at being religious or moral. <br> In more conservative, evangelical groups, the deception may be just as deadly.  It goes something like this: anyone who, at some time in their life, agrees with the simple Gospel and makes a profession of faith in Christ, is guaranteed entrance into God’s Kingdom.  This guarantee is based on what is generally called the “doctrine of eternal security”. </p>
<p>
However, the things Jesus said about the Kingdom of Heaven make it clear that neither of these positions can be defended.  The real issue is, and forever will be, relationship! <br> Jesus does not teach us that salvation may be found in following certain religious traditions or rituals.  His on-going battles with the religious leaders of His day are proof enough of that.  Neither does He describe salvation as something that is established by making a profession of faith. <br> A profession of faith is to salvation, what an introduction is to a relationship.  When one person is introduced to another, the introduction does not constitute a relationship - only the possible beginning of one.  And that’s all a profession of faith could possibly be - an introduction to Jesus.  It’s what happens after the introduction that determines whether or not a real relationship exists, and that is what determines true salvation.</p>
<h3>
Your relationship with Jesus
</h3> 
<p>
The question will always be: “Do you <i>know</i> Him?”  It will never be: “Do you belong to a church?” or, “Do you attend church regularly?” or “Have you made a profession of faith in Jesus?” <br> John 17 makes it clear enough, <dr class="alt5">“And this is eternal life, that they may <i>know</i> You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent.” (John 17:3)</dr class="alt5">  The verse is a simple equation.  On one side of the equation is eternal life, and on the other side is what constitutes eternal life - <i>knowing</i> the Father and <i>knowing</i> the one He sent, Jesus Christ.  The key issue is, <i>knowing God</i>. </p>  
<p>
Throughout this presentation, I have italicised <i>know</i> and <i>knowing</i> to remind you that the issue is <i>knowing</i> God, that is, having a relationship with Him that is real. <br> <i>Knowing</i> is not determined by what you’ve been taught about God in class. <br> It’s not determined by what may have happened in a moment of time at some point in the past.  It’s determined by what happened yesterday, what you’re doing today, and what you’re going to do tomorrow.  It’s a continual, moment-by-moment existence with God characterised by your real experiences with Him, your understanding of Him, of what He wants to do in your life and your submission and obedience to that. </p> 
<p>
If anyone thinks that <i>knowing</i> God is not the determining issue in who goes to Heaven and who goes to Hell, look at Matthew 7, <dr class="alt5">“Not everyone who says to Me, "Lord, Lord," shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of My Father in heaven. Many will say to Me in that day, "Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Your name, cast out demons in Your name, and done many wonders in Your name? And then I will declare to them, "I never <i>knew</i> you; depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness!” (Matt 7:21-23)</dr class="alt5"> </p> 
<p>
This passage illustrates the difference between <i>knowing</i> God and <i>knowing</i> about God.  These people obviously <i>knew</i> about God and about religious matters and were willing to do things that, in their estimation, were things God would approve of.  It is also obvious that they were able to live this kind of life without ever really <i>knowing</i> God, because this is the indictment He delivers against them - <dr class="alt5">“I never <i>knew</i> you” </dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
Who will be saved
</h3>  
<p>
There is a deception in the church today that is related to the question of who, or how many, will actually be saved.  <br>In the preceding passage, Jesus says that on the occasion of His Second Advent, “many” will experience the sad event described.<br>  It was evident to some, on the basis of what Jesus taught that salvation would be difficult to achieve. <br> This was the case in the following passage found in Luke 13:<br>  
<dr class="alt5">
“ Then one said to Him, “Lord, are there few who are saved?”
And He said to them, “Strive to enter through the narrow gate, for many, I say to you, will seek to enter and will not be able. When once the Master of the house has risen up and shut the door, and you begin to stand outside and knock at the door, saying, "Lord, Lord, open for us", and He will answer and say to you, "I do not <i>know</i> you, where you are from" then you will begin to say, We ate and drank in Your presence, and You taught in our streets". But He will say, "I tell you I do not <i>know</i> you, where you are from. Depart from Me, all you workers of iniquity. There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, when you see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and yourselves thrust out. They will come from the east and the west, from the north and the south, and sit down in the kingdom of God. And indeed there are last who will be first, and there are first who will be last.” (Luke 13:23-30)</dr class="alt5"> </p>
<p>
If this paraphrase is accurate, and I believe it is, then the issue of making a simple profession of faith has been addressed. <br> The religious notion of <i>knowing</i> God has more to do with a simple acknowledging of His existence accompanied with some degree of knowledge about Him. <br> God’s idea of<i> knowing</i> Him has more to do with a relationship in every true sense of the word (there is time spent, information exchanged, a connection is made that influences behaviour and decisions, intimacy is enjoyed, etc.). <br> A true relationship can never be defined by what one person knows about another, it must be defined by what one person has experienced with another on a personal level.  And this is how we must define our relationship with God. <br> It was never God’s intention for us to simply <i>know</i> about Him, He wants us to experience Him.  He wants us to <i>know</i> that He is real, and not just an idea or concept (Hebrews 11:6). </p>
<p>
In John 5 Jesus confronts the religious notion that <i>knowing</i> about God is tantamount to salvation:  <dr class="alt5">“You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify of Me.” (John 5:39)</dr class="alt5"> <br>
Jesus’ point must be taken seriously - salvation cannot be found in words on a page!  There is no such thing as a “simple plan of salvation”. <br> It is not 3, 4, or 5, easy steps, then back to living your life the way it was, business as usual<br> (except, maybe you go to church sometimes, so you can learn more about God). </p>
<p>
Real life, eternal life is found only in the person of Jesus Christ. <br> He is life (John 1:4; 5:26; 6:35; 8:12; 11:25; and 14:6).  Without Him, there is no life! 
Another point that must be mentioned, if only briefly, is what Jesus says in Luke 13:24, <dr class="alt5">“Strive to enter through the narrow gate"</dr class="alt5"> that leads to salvation - to God.” <br> Having a relationship with God isn’t easy.  It’s hard, because it is opposite to everything we see, or know, or want in our natural senses.  It requires effort to discipline ourselves and set the right priorities in our lives, so we have time to spend with God.  Then, it takes determination to focus on Him, and not let our rebellious mind wander (it’s amazing how my mind wants to think about everything except God, when I try to get alone with Him). </p> 
<p>
Jesus talked about this in John 6,<dr class="alt5"> “Do not labour for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give you, because God the Father has set His seal on Him.” Then they said to Him, “What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?”
Jesus answered and said to them, “This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He sent.” (John 6:27-29)</dr class="alt5"></p> 
<p>
Making your relationship with God your first priority in life would be a foreign concept to most people today.  For many, putting marriage, family, career, even hobbies or leisure time before God is perfectly acceptable. <br> Think about this: the world, the flesh and the Devil want to make salvation easy.  But, God says salvation is difficult, because, to achieve it, we must overcome the world, the flesh and the Devil.</p>
<h3>
Teaching with parables
</h3> 
<p>
There are about 48 parables in Matthew.  Jesus used many of them to teach different aspects of the Kingdom of Heaven.  Some illustrate various characteristics of the Kingdom itself, others point out either good or bad qualities found in those who inhabit the Kingdom. <br>

The English word “parable” comes from the Greek parabole, and means comparison.  Jesus used parables to illustrate truth and clarify it by comparing it to things familiar to those listening.  However, it is evident that, even though the illustrations were familiar, the spiritual truths were not apparent to all who heard them.<br> 
This is why the disciples came to Jesus and asked Him why He used parables. The following is Jesus’ answer:</p> 
<p>
After Jesus had finished the story about the sower, the seeds and the different kinds of soil,<dr class="alt5"> the disciples came and said to Him, “Why do You speak to them in parables?” He answered and said to them, “Because it has been given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. For whoever has, to him more will be given, and he will have abundance; but whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him. Therefore I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. And in them the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled, which says: "Hearing you will hear and shall not understand, and seeing you will see and not perceive; For the hearts of this people have grown dull. Their ears are hard of hearing, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears,lest they should understand with their hearts and turn, so that I should heal them." But blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears for they hear; for assuredly, I say to you that many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it.
“Therefore hear the parable of the sower: (Matt 13:10-18)</dr class="alt5"><br>  
Make sure you understand it completely.  </p>
<h3>
Separating the sheep from the goats
</h3>
<p>
As I’ve already mentioned, the end of the Kingdom of Heaven is described in detail in Matthew 25:31-46, when the sheep are separated from the goats.  This separation is mentioned in many of the parables, as well.  And here, in Matthew 13, as Jesus is explaining to His disciples why He teaches the people with parables, the same idea of separation is evident.  Jesus taught parables to separate those who were interested in knowing God from those who weren’t. </p>
<p>
This same principle of separation is in operation today.  In Luke 13:24 Jesus said earnest effort was required to push your way through the narrow door that leads to salvation.  In other words, knowing God requires effort, it does not come easily - it is not automatic.  If we are going to know God, it will require determination on our part.  Be assured, God will bless the effort.  He wants us to know Him, and He’s not hiding  (His promise today is the same as it’s always been - if we seek Him, we will find Him, He’s not far from any one of us, Deuteronomy 4:29-31; Jeremiah 29:11-13; Acts 17:27).  But, effort is required.  A simple profession of faith, church membership, or even consistent church attendance will not suffice.</p> 
<p>
This is what separates the sheep from the goats in the Kingdom of Heaven today.  Those who are content to trust in their religion are the ones taking the broad, easy road that leads to destruction.  Their religion is teaching them to know about God.  On the other hand, those who expend the time and effort necessary to know God are the ones forcing their way in to God through the narrow door (remember Matthew 7:13,14; Luke 13:24).</p>
<p>
The Kingdom of Heaven is here.  The realm of professing Christians needs to take relationship with God seriously.  This is the time that determines who will be the sheep and who will be the goats.  Jesus is warning us.  The time of final separation may be closer than we think.</p>
<p>
Let me encourage you, find a red-letter edition of the Bible and just read the red letters in the four Gospels.  Don’t just read these papers and try to determine if what you’re reading is right or wrong.  Submit yourself to God and to His Holy Spirit and let Him reveal the truth to you.  That is the only thing that will give you the understanding and determination you need to truly follow God. </p>
