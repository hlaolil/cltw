    <h1>
Trusting God Word
</h1>
<h3>
Believing in God in times of crisis
</h3>
<p> 
Do you know what the root of lack of contentment is? Many times we blame bad circumstances or people but the truth is that lack of contentment is a lack of trust in God. We may think we trust God, but when things begin to tighten up why do we complain, get mad, or grumble? Don’t we know that the Almighty God is sovereign? Don’t we know that He knows much more than we do about what is best for our lives?</p>
<h3>
Trusting God 
</h3>
<p>
Trusting in God ~ we are His sheep<br>
Christ said: <dr class="alt5">"Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid". (John 14:27)</dr class="alt5"><br>
You see, Christ’s peace is not circumstantial. When we abide in His peace, we are deciding to trust God no matter what. He is our shepherd and we are His sheep.<br>
Where can you find contentment? Is it in something that you get, have or achieve?
Basing our contentment on circumstances or on the Lord?
Why do circumstances rob our peace? Are we basing our peace and joy on the Lord or on circumstances?
<dr class="alt5">
And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose. (Rom 8:28)</dr class="alt5">
If we trust God that all things will work together for the good, then when we face problems and difficulties we can still be thankful. We may not “feel” like that trial is for our good while going through it but we must “believe” that it is. Faith should not be dependent on “feelings”.</p>
<p>
Feelings many times are a consequence of wrong thinking. If we think wrongly we will feel wrongly. Unfortunately people base their decisions on how they are feeling. The word of God says that we must not trust our heart. So we must not trust our feelings- instead we must base our lives on something that does not falter.
Something that doesn’t fall. God’s word is truth and will never fall. Believing that all things that come our way have a purpose and a reason is essential to being content no matter what happens. True everlasting contentment can only be found in the Lord.</p>
<h3>
“If only” phrases 
</h3>
<p>
We see that Paul had learned to be content in all sorts of situations:<br>
<dr class="alt5">
"... for I have learned in whatever state I am, to be content: I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound. Everywhere and in all things I have learned both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need".<br> (Phil 4:11-12)</dr class="alt5"><br>
Notice that it doesn’t say if something good happens to you then you be content.
Many times people think “if only this would happen” or “if only this circumstance would change” –then they would be content, thankful and at peace.
When we use these “if only” phrases we are basing our peace and happiness on outside factors. We are living a circumstantial happiness that is bound to flee when things change.</p>
<h3>
The key to contentment
</h3>
<p>
Submission to God is a key to contentment. We must make a conscious decision to submit to the Lord. When we submit our will to Him- His peace takes over. We have decided to be obedient and submit. There is no more struggle of the wills. He is our shepherd- we are His sheep. We can abide in Him because we base our lives completely in Him. There is a freedom in submitting to the Lord. The freedom of not trying to carry life’s burdens on our own.</p>
