Believers Baptism
</h1>
<p>
The purpose of this article is to examine the word of God concerning the subject of believer's baptism. Although there are seven baptisms in the Bible, we are concerned here with water baptism as it relates to the born-again Christian.<br> We will examine some important questions which arise concerning one of the first steps in the new Christian's walk with the Lord, believer's baptism.</p>
<p>
By <dr class="alt5">"rightly dividing the word of truth"</dr class="alt5"> (2 Tim 2:15), we can find practical answers to these questions and understand God's purpose for believer's baptism.</p>
<h3>
What is Baptism?
</h3>
<p>
What then is believer's baptism? What is the purpose of it, since salvation is <dr class="alt5"><br>"by grace you have been saved through faith" (Eph 2:8,9)</dr class="alt5">?</p>
<p>
Water baptism is clearly a Figure or Type of something which already took place in the heart of the believer the moment he/she was saved (1 Pet. 3:21). Water baptism is the ordinance representing the identification of the Christian with the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>
You are "crucified" (standing upright in water), you are "buried" (immersed into the water), and you are "resurrected into life" (raised out of the water).<br> Water baptism then, is a picture of spiritual baptism as defined in Rom 6:3-5 and 1 Cor 12:13. It is the outward testimony of the believer's inward faith. <br>A sinner is saved the moment he places his faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Baptism is a visible testimony to that faith.</p>
<p>
This is the Scriptural basis for water baptism. It <font color="orangered">Pictures and Proclaims</font> four important things:<br>
Scriptural baptism <font color="orangered">Pictures and Proclaims</font> the believer's death, burial, and resurrection with Christ. <dr class="alt5">"buried with Him in baptism, in which you also were raised with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the dead." (Col 2:12)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Scriptural baptism <font color="orangered">Pictures and Proclaims</font> the death of our old life to sin, and our resurrection to walk in newness of life.<dr class="alt5"> "just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life." <br>(Rom 6:4)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Scriptural baptism <font color="orangered">Pictures and Proclaims</font> our faith in the Trinity of the Godhead. <dr class="alt5">"Baptising them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit." (Matt 28:19)<dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Scriptural baptism <font color="orangered">Pictures and Proclaims</font> our "putting on" of Christ.<dr class="alt5"> "For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus. 27 For as many of you as were baptised into Christ have put on Christ. (Gal 3:26-27)<dr class="alt5"> </p>
<p>
So then, water baptism is a picture of what transpired when you placed your faith and trust in the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ to save you from your sins (Rom 6:3-5). It does not atone for sin. Only the blood of Christ cleanses us from sin (I John 1:7; Col 1:14).</p>
<h3>
Who should be Baptised?
</h3>
<p>
Next, let's consider who should be baptised. The Bible makes it clear that scriptural baptism is <font color="firebrick">Believer's Baptism</font>.</p>
<p>
In Acts 2:41 we observe that they received the word, then they were baptised.
In Acts 8:12,36,37 we find that they believed, <font color="firebrick">then</font> they were baptised.
In Acts 10:43,44,47, it is plain to see that those who believed received the  Holy Spirit, and <font color="firebrick">then</font> they were baptised. (Lost people do not receive the Holy Spirit).<br>
The Philippian jailer asked,<dr class="alt5"> "what must I do to be saved?” So they said, “Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved ..." (Acts 16:30-34)</dr class="alt5">. Paul did not tell him to be baptised to be saved. His baptism came <font color="firebrick">after</font> his believing, which sets the scriptural standard.</p>
<p>
Who then should be baptised? According to the established Bible pattern, only those who have trusted the Lord Jesus Christ as their personal Saviour.</p>
<p>
Water baptism then, is <font color="firebrick">not</font> salvation, but obedience to a command by God concerning discipleship.</p>
<h3>
When and where should we be Baptised?
</h3>
<p>
When is the believer to be baptised? The Bible teaches that water baptism follows shortly after spiritual baptism (the new birth).</p>
<p>
Notice the example of Paul (Acts 9:18), Cornelius (Acts 10:43-48), and the Philippian Jailer (Acts 16:33).</p>
<p>
You were placed into the body of Christ by spiritual baptism at the moment you were saved (Gal 3:26-27). Now you follow the miracle of spiritual baptism with physical immersion into water, according to Acts 8:38; 10:47; 16:33.</p>
<p>
As to where a believer is to be baptised, the obvious answer is in the presence of other believers, the local New Testament church. The Lord Jesus Christ gave the local church the ordinance of water baptism (Matt28:18-20).
An ordinance is a ceremony appointed by Christ to be administered in the local church as a visible type of the sacrifice of Christ on Calvary.</p>
<h3>
How should we be Baptised?
</h3>
<p>
How is a believer to be baptised? Immersion in water is the only scriptural method of baptism.
In Matt 3:13-16 and in Mark 1:9-10 we find that John the Baptist needed "much water" for baptism.
In Acts 8:38-39 we are taught baptism by immersion.
In Rom 6:3-6 we see that baptism must fulfil three types: death, burial and resurrection. It is also referred to as being "planted", and being raised.<br> It is not difficult to see that the only mode of baptism which fulfils all these pictures is the immersion of the believer in water. Furthermore, scriptural expressions such as "much water" (John 3:23), and "down both into the water" (Acts 8:38) are very conclusive evidence that water baptism is by immersion.</p>
<h3>
Why should we be Baptised?
</h3>
<p>
Spiritual baptism is the Christian's identification with Christ (Col 2:12).<BR> This is why we should submit to water baptism.

Rom 6:3-5 teaches us that it is literally a picture of your death, burial and resurrection with Christ. It is your first act of obedience to God after salvation. <BR>Why be baptised? Consider the following:

Scriptural baptism pleases the Lord. When Jesus was baptised, God the Father said, <dr class="alt5">"This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased" (Matt 3:17)</dr class="alt5">. When we follow the example of the Lord Jesus Christ we certainly please the Father.<br>
Scriptural baptism is a testimony to the world. Jesus said, <dr class="alt5">“Therefore whoever confesses Me before men, him I will also confess before My Father who is in heaven." (Matt 10:32)</dr class="alt5">. Our baptism is a public testimony of our faith in the Lord Jesus: Christ, and the way in which we identify ourselves with Christ in His death, burial and resurrection.</p>
<h3>
In conclusion
</h3>
<p>
We understand and believe that baptism is not a "sacrament" that imparts saving grace, but an ordinance. We are not saved by baptism, but by faith in Jesus Christ <dr class="alt5">"... the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin."<br> (1 John 1:7)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
Baptism is the outward symbol of what has already transpired in the heart of the one who has trusted the Lord Jesus Christ for full salvation. </p>
