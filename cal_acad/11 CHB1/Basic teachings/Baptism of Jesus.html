Baptism of Jesus
</h1>
<p>
In this article I would like to set forth three reasons for the baptism of Jesus by John.</p>
<p>
1.It was to identify the Lord as the Son of God at the beginning of His ministry.</p>
<p>
2.It was a commencement token of the total dedication of Christ in carrying out &#160;&#160;&#160;Heaven’s plan.</p>
<p>
3.It was a visual precursor to the Saviour’s ultimate death, burial, and &#160;&#160;&#160;resurrection.</p>
<p>
 Each of these points needs some development.</p>
<h3>
“This is the Son of God.”
</h3>
<p>
John the Baptiser was a remarkable character. Isaiah prophetically described him as <dr class="alt5">“The voice of one crying in the wilderness:” preparing the way of the Lord (Isa 40:1-3)</dr class="alt5">. The Old Testament closes with the promise of the coming <dr class="alt5">“Elijah” (Mal 4:5-6)</dr class="alt5">, an allusion to John, whose mission, in the spirit and power of Elijah, was <dr class="alt5">to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.” (Luke 1:17)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
John announced Jesus as <dr class="alt5">“The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!” (John 1:29)</dr class="alt5">. The expression <dr class="alt5">“Lamb of God”</dr class="alt5"> reveals that Jesus was the anti type (fulfilment) of the Old Testament sacrificial system. It argues for the atoning nature of the Lord’s death and, potentially, the universal accessibility of that blessing.<br>
John declared that it was his mission to prepare the way for Christ, who was to come “after” him, i.e., John’s work would precede the Lord’s <dr class="alt5">"After me comes a Man who is preferred before me, for He was before me" (John 1:30)</dr class="alt5">.<br> John declared: <dr class="alt5">“He is before me,” </dr class="alt5">i.e., Christ, due to His divine nature, was to take precedence over “the baptist,” because, as John says, <dr class="alt5">“He was before me.”</dr class="alt5"> The imperfect tense verb,(was), asserts the abiding existence of Jesus before John was born (cf. John 1:1).
But the baptiser continued:<dr class="alt5"> “I did not know Him; but that He should be revealed to Israel, therefore I came baptising with water.” (John 1:31)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
John is confessing that, prior to the phenomenal events at the Jordan, he did not know, “in an absolute way” that Jesus was the Messiah. John knew that the Nazarene was an exceptional person, for he resisted immersing the Lord, insisting: <dr class="alt5">“I need to be baptised by You” (Matt 3:14)</dr class="alt5">. He did not have, however, a clear understanding of the Saviour's true identity until he saw the Spirit descend in the form of a dove, and he heard the divine voice break the silence of fifteen centuries in the acknowledgement: <dr class="alt5">“This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased” (Matt 3:17)</dr class="alt5">.<br>
After this occurred, the baptiser could testify: <dr class="alt5">“This is the Son of God” <br>(John 1:34)</dr class="alt5"><br> Accordingly, one of the reasons for Jesus’ baptism was to confirm the Lord’s identity to the prophet, so that John could <dr class="alt5">“reveal to Israel” (John 1:31)</dr class="alt5"> the good news that the Messiah had arrived.</p>
<h3>
An Example of Obedience
</h3>
<p>
In His argument to persuade John to administer baptism, Christ said: <dr class="alt5">“it is fitting for us to fulfil all righteousness.” (Matt 3:15)</dr class="alt5">. <br>Perhaps we cannot plumb the full depth of this abbreviated clause; one thing is certain though: it is an affirmation of the submissive disposition of the Lord Jesus to the Father’s will. “Righteousness” is associated with the commands of God (Psa. 119:172). To fulfil righteousness, therefore, is to be obedient to God.
The life of Jesus is a commentary on what obedience is about. In the 40th Psalm, which is clearly messianic in its import (cf. Heb. 10:5-7), the submissive demeanour of Christ is prophetically set forth. Jesus, through David, a thousand years before His own birth, affirms: <dr class="alt5">“I delight to do Your will, O my God; and Your law is within my heart.” (Psa 40:8)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
It is one thing to begrudgingly go through a form of service; it is quite another to “delight” in doing the Father’s will. Again, while some may have the elements of divine “law” in their heads, the issue is: Do we have, as did Jesus, the law in our hearts?
Christ demonstrated by His baptism, therefore, on the very first day of His public ministry, that He was committed to doing His Father’s will. In this regard, as in all others, He is our perfect model.</p>
<h3>
A Preview of Gospel Facts
</h3>
<p>
In his first epistle to the Corinthians, Paul set forth the fundamental components of the gospel:
<dr class="alt5">“brethren, I declare to you the gospel ...  that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures” (1 Cor 15:1-4)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
The death of Jesus, as the key ingredient in the plan of redemption, was in the mind of God before the foundation of the world (cf. 1 Pet. 1:19).<BR> Christ Himself, though, developed as a normal human being, including the expansion of mental consciousness. <dr class="alt5">Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and men (Luke 2:52)</dr class="alt5">.
One cannot but wonder at what point, in His mental and physical maturation, the blessed Saviour became aware of His ultimate destiny at Calvary. We know that by the age of twelve Jesus was cognisant of His unique status as the Son of God. <dr class="alt5">I must be about My Father’s business” (Luke 2:49)</dr class="alt5">. <BR>From the time of his infancy, Mary was privy to the dark shadows that loomed in her Son’s future (Luke 2:35).
One thing seems clear; by the time He submitted to immersion at the hands of John, He knew of His appointment with the cross — and likely long before that.</p>
<p>
At this point it is imperative that we give some attention to the form of baptism. Those who argue that “baptism” may be administered either by the sprinkling or pouring of water, fly directly into the face of: linguistic evidence, New Testament usage, and the testimony of early Christian history.
The verb baptizo means to “dip, immerse”.<br> Even the translators so understood its meaning in non-theological contexts where their bias did not over-power them (cf. Luke 16:24; John 13:26).</p>
<p>
Baptism is clearly identified with a “burial” (Rom. 6:3-4; Col. 2:12).<br>
Sprinkling was first introduced in the 3rd century A.D. (Eusebius VI, XLIII), and the innovation did not become the official practice of the apostate Roman Church until A.D. 1311, when the Council of Ravenna first allowed a choice between immersion and sprinkling.<br>
Clearly then, the baptism of Jesus in the waters of Jordan involved a burial beneath the water, and a resurrection there from. Mark specifically states that Jesus was baptised of John “in the Jordan,” and afterwards, the Lord came up “out of” the water (Mark 1:9-10). </p>
<p>
Why is it that so many have such a difficult time in understanding the form of baptism? It is so vital to the entire format of the divine plan of salvation. Christ’s burial in the water of Jordan, and His resurrection there from, was a visual preview of the burial (which implies a death, of course) and resurrection of the Lord, which would occur three and one-half years later. 
It is commonly suggested by commentators that Christ was baptised in order to “solidify” Himself with sinners, since He, by His death, would bear away the penalty for sin. That may be the case, but the Bible does not specifically argue that point.<p>
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
We may not understand all the reasons why Christ submitted to baptism. We have a limited view of that wonderful event. We should, however, note this: If the sinless Son of God did not refuse this divine ordinance, how much less should men today neglect the command, which is declared to be <dr class="alt5">“Repent, and let every one of you be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins” (Acts 2:38)</dr class="alt5"></p>
