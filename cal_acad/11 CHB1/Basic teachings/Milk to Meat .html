Milk to Meat 
</h1>
<p>
When we are born into the family of God, we are like the little babies. If you have noticed a bunch of babies, you will understand how difficult it is to handle them. They just do not know how to conduct themselves. They begin to cry. They fall down all the time. They are just infants. Their parents are making every effort to make them grow. We, as adults want to take care of the babies so that they grow up. We expect them to go from liquid food to solid food. If a baby is drinking milk for years, then there is something wrong. In the same way, God wants each of His children to grow up. God wants all his children to grow from drinking milk to eating meat.</p>
<h3>
1. Desire the milk of the word of God: 
</h3>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">"as newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby". (1 Peter 2:2)</dr class="alt5"> God wants us to feed on His word and thereby grow up to be mature children of God. The new born babies are so desirous of drinking milk. They are hungry all the time and need frequent feeding. In the same way, if you feel that you are not grown enough in God, begin feeding on the word of God on a continual basis. You will soon see yourself growing to become a toddler and then to an adult.</p>
<h3>
2. Eat the meat of the word of God: 
</h3>
<p><dr class="alt5">
"For everyone who partakes only of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe. But solid food belongs to those who are of full age that is, those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil". (Heb. 5:13-14)</dr class="alt5">
Meat is for the person whose digestive system is good enough to digest the heavy stuff. Milk is easy to digest but meat is not. You need to train your senses by practising to discern between good and evil. You need to take the time to exercise what the word of God says. We cannot afford to starve your spirits by trying to get a little word once in a way.</p>
<h3>
3. Train your Spirit man: 
</h3>
<p><dr class="alt5">
 "Exhort one another daily, while it is called today". (Heb. 3:13)</dr class="alt5">
 We need to train believers who are unskilled in the word of righteousness and help them to maturity. Find your place. There are a lot of spiritual babies born all the time. You can help bring them from milk to meat. Begin to exhort them today. The body of Christ needs some growth. Instead of standing strong, we often are torn apart by division and criticisms.</p>
<p>
 May the Lord take us from milk to meat in Jesus’ name. Amen.</p>
