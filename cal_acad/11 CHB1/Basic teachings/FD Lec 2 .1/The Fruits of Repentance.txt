<h1>
The Fruits of Repentance
</h1>
<h3>
Refreshment, Restoration, and Fruit. 
</h3>
<p>
When we cry out, like King David, <dr class="alt5">“Have mercy on me, O God,” (Psa 51:1)</dr class="alt5"> God responds .
<br> When we see our sin and imitate Peter by saying, <dr class="alt5">“Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!” (Luke 5:8)</dr class="alt5">, he doesn’t “depart.” Instead, he begins to work in us, refreshing us, restoring us, and even empowering us to bear godly fruit. In this article, we want to look at these three blessings and then explore the different opportunities God has given us to receive the grace of His mercy and forgiveness.</p>
<p>
The first thing God does when we repent is to bring us back from captivity by refreshing our weary hearts <dr class="alt5">"For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul.” (Jer 31:25)</dr class="alt5">. He refreshes us by removing the burden of guilt and shame and darkness that sin creates within us. He refreshes us by setting our hearts at peace and showering us with mercy. And He refreshes us by assuring us that we are still His beloved sons and daughters, members of His family and coheirs with Christ.</p>
<p>
Repentance also gives us a taste of the kind of restoration that the prodigal son felt when he came home. He was weary, grimy, and smelly from his misadventures, but his father immediately embraced him and sought to restore him. All the articles that he gave his son—a ring, sandals, and a robe—were signs of dignity and belonging. They were meant to show the boy that he had indeed come home, where he could finally find rest and acceptance. And this is exactly what God does for us every time we return to Him in repentance. He restores our sense of dignity and reassures us that we are completely forgiven.</p>
<p>
When the prodigal returned home, he likely faced a number of challenges: the challenge to change his behaviour and expectations of life, the challenge to allow his wounded memories to be healed, even the challenge to be reconciled with his older brother. But perhaps the biggest challenge had nothing to do with the past but with the future: the challenge to <dr class="alt5">“bear fruit worthy of repentance” (Matt 3:8)</dr class="alt5">. In other words, full restoration includes the restoration of a person’s calling as well as the restoration of his dignity and his relationships. When God forgives us, He wants to assure us that our sins are forgotten, but He also wants to reassure us that we can still bear wonderful fruit.</p>
<h3>
Opportunities for Repentance.
</h3>
<p> 
So how do we get free? We can summarise repentance into four simple steps we can take. First, we can begin by admitting to the Lord that we have dishonoured Him and that our only hope is in His mercy. Second, we should examine our hearts and actions during the day and try to make a list of the sins we recall. Third, we should confess these sins clearly to the Lord, trusting that if we do so,<dr class="alt5"> “... He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.” (1 John 1:9)</dr class="alt5">. Finally, we should not forget to forgive those who have hurt us during the day. Of course, some hurts simply take more time to heal than others, but every day we can take another step toward fully forgiving so that we can know God’s forgiveness as fully as possible.</p>
<p>
Essentially, there are three opportunities open to us to make this fourfold act of repentance and to receive the forgiveness and cleansing that Jesus wants to give us. The first is in the privacy and intimacy of our own prayer life. We should all make it a point to establish the habit of examining our consciences at the end of each day. Just as Paul encouraged us <dr class="alt5">Be angry, and do not sin”: do not let the sun go down on your wrath,(Eph 4:26)</dr class="alt5">.
If you have sins it’s always a good idea to bring them all to the Lord as soon as possible so that their sting is removed and so that guilt does not get the upper hand.</p>
<h3>
Times of Refreshing 
</h3>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">Repent therefore and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, (Acts 3:19)</dr class="alt5">. Through repentance, we are restored to an intimate relationship with God. Through repentance, our sense of dignity is restored. And through repentance, we are set free to love those around us with a renewed heart and a clean conscience.</p>
<p>
According to Paul, <dr class="alt5">“where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.” (2 Cor 3:17)</dr class="alt5">. Make the decision to seek out God’s mercy and forgiveness. Let the freedom of the Holy Spirit reign in your heart. Trust that every time you do turn to him in repentance, you will come away feeling washed clean from front to back, from top to bottom, and from head to toe.</p>
