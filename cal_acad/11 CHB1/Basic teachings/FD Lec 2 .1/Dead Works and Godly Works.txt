Dead Works and Godly Works
</h1>
<h2>
Dead Works
</h2>
<p> 
Hebrews 6:1-2 lists six basic teachings of the New Testament. The first doctrine is “repentance from dead works.” The author is instructing his audience of Jewish converts to use these fundamental teachings as a springboard to “go on to perfection.”
In order to understand this first doctrine, we must consider the context of the book of Hebrews. We must understand why the book was written.</p>
<h3>
Written to a Jewish audience
</h3>
<p>
The theme of the book of Hebrews is the superiority of Christ. The author endeavours to explain and convince his Jewish audience why the New Covenant is far superior to the Old Covenant. The Jews believed that keeping God’s laws was the only means of remaining upright with God. They relied on the sacrificial system and strict law keeping to somehow pay for past sins and justify themselves to God.</p>
<p>
This wrong concept was difficult to overcome even among converted Jews. They had to be reminded that the concept of justification by law keeping was not possible. The author reinforces the truth that faith in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ is the only way to have our sins forgiven. Keeping God’s laws is essential, but law keeping can never forgive sin or save anyone. Christians can never be justified by any form of works, even good works.</p>
<p>
Later in the book of Hebrews the Jewish Christians were reminded that temple rituals had had their purposes, but now <dr class="alt5">how much more shall the blood of Christ”</dr class="alt5"> which was the only way <dr class="alt5">“cleanse your conscience from dead works” (Heb 9:14).</dr class="alt5"> Animal sacrifices could never forgive sin or cleanse the conscience.</p>
<h3>
This also applies to us
</h3>
<p>
The instruction in the book of Hebrews is not limited to a Jewish audience at the time of the original writing. Everyone has “dead works” that need forgiveness. Dead works precede our conversion and can plague us after conversion.</p>
<p>
Repentance from dead works applies to everyone.<dr class="alt5"> “All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work” (2 Tim 3:16-17).</dr class="alt5">
We must understand repentance in order to grasp this first fundamental doctrine.</p>
<h3>
What is repentance?
</h3>
<p>
Repentance is a change of attitude, mind and actions. Repentance is toward God, sincerely asking Him to forgive our sins and then determining, with God’s help, to change the direction of our life. Those who repent come to a place in life where they recognise their personal sins and understand that Christ died so that those sins can be forgiven. They ask God to forgive those sins and are baptised in water.</p>
<h2>
Godly Works
</h2>
<p>
Works are addressed throughout the New Testament. The Bible speaks of two types of works. One type is godly and acceptable to God; the other type is sinful and unacceptable to God.</p>
<h3>
Godly works
</h3>
<p>
The words work or works are translated from the Greek word ergon. Vine’s Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words defines ergon in the context of believers as “a deed, act” (pp. 683-684). Godly works are deeds or actions that God accepts. Such works are the result of faith and putting the 10 Commandments into action in our lives.</p>
<p>
The book of James defines godly works, the deeds or actions God accepts, as obedience to His law as defined in the Scripture (James 1:21-27; 2:8-26). James specifically defines “works” as actions or deeds—and tells us to be a “doer of the work” (James 1:25). He clearly refers to godly works as living by the 10 Commandments and other godly principles as they are amplified throughout the Bible.</p>
<p>
Jesus taught His disciples to set a good example by letting their lights shine before all men (Matthew 5:16). Their examples were defined as “good works,” that is, obedience to God’s law.</p>
<p>
Paul expounds the concept of good works as the “fruit of the Spirit”—thoughts and actions that are opposite of the “works of the flesh.” These good works produced by God’s Spirit in us are “love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control” (Galatians 5:22-23).
