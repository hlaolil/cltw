What is Repentance
</h1>
<p>
Definition: Repentance means a sincere turning away, in both the mind and heart, from self to God.</p>
<p>
In a biblical context, repentance is recognising that our sin is offensive to God. Repentance can be shallow, such as the remorse we feel because of fear of punishment (like Cain) or it can be deep, such as realising how much our sins cost Jesus Christ and how His saving grace washes us clean (like the conversion of Paul).</p>
<h3>
Calls for repentance 
</h3>
<p>
Calls for repentance are found throughout the Old Testament, such as Ezek 18:<dr class="alt5">
"Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways,” says the Lord God. “Repent, and turn from all your transgressions, so that iniquity will not be your ruin." (Ezek 18:30)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Jesus also calls for repentance:
"The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel." (Mark 1:15)</p>
<p>
Repentance is an essential part of salvation, requiring a turning away from the sin-ruled life to a life characterised by obedience to God. The Holy Spirit leads a person to repent, but repentance itself cannot be seen as a "good work" that adds to our salvation.</p>
<p>
The Bible states that people are saved by faith alone (Eph 2:8-9). However, there can be no faith in Christ without repentance and no repentance without faith. The two are inseparable.</p>
