   <h1>
The Foretaste of Resurrection
</h1>
<h2> 
The Spirit and the Dawn of the New Age
</h2>
<h3>
The Spirit and the Christ-event.
</h3>
<p> 
According to Paul, the giving of the Spirit is linked to that 

great eschatological event at the mid-point of history: the death 

and resurrection of Jesus Christ. The events of the Cross were 

completely overcome in the minds of the early believers in the 

light of the resurrection and the coming of the Spirit. According 

to Gal 3:13-14, Christ’s death on the Cross opened up the way for 

the coming of Spirit (cf. also Rom 8:1-4). </p>
<p>
Without the resurrection, of course, the Cross would have been a 

disaster, and so we find that the resurrection and the Spirit are 

more closely related than the Cross and the Spirit. In Rom 8

we are informed that <dr class="alt5">the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you. (Rom 8:11)</dr class="alt5"> <br>In 1 Cor 6 Paul says <dr 

class="alt5">And God both raised up the Lord and will also raise 

us up by His power. (1 Cor 6:14)</dr class="alt5"> That power, is 

an equivalent for pneuma, is not hard to show from the New 

Testament.  <br>Another synonym for Spirit is doxa, and it is 

expressly stated that <dr class="alt5">Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father (Rom. 6:4)</dr class="alt5">. Not only is the Spirit thought of as the power 

at work in the raising of Jesus from the dead, but the post-

resurrection life of our Lord is characterised by the Spirit <dr 

class="alt5">and declared to be the Son of God with power 

according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the 

dead.” (Rom 1:4)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
In His new mode of existence Christ is also the Dispenser of the 

Spirit. The Spirit is the gift of the risen Lord. It is through 

the gift of the Spirit that the believer experiences the presence 

and the power of the risen Lord in his life. “The Holy Spirit is 

the gift of the risen Christ to the church. This is the central 

New Testament message concerning the Spirit.” The Spirit receives 

character and identity through His connection with Jesus Christ, 

the risen and exalted Lord. The Spirit is the <dr class="alt5">Spirit of Jesus 

Christ (Rom. 8:9, Phil. 1:19)</dr class="alt5">.</p> 

<p>“The resurrection is the occasion 

of the liberating of Christ to be a life-giving Spirit,” says 

Hill. “This in very personal terms means that Christ is known to 

be alive because He is experienced today as a power influencing 

our lives and this living and abiding impact is the Spirit.” The 

Spirit is the earthly presence of the glorified Lord. The gift of 

the Spirit is the church’s guarantee that Christ has begun His 

reign, having assumed authority as He sits at God’s right hand, 

and this reign of Christ is seen uniquely in the church.</p>
<p>
In 2 Cor. 3 it appears at first sight as if the exalted Lord 

is identified with the Spirit (<dr class="alt5">“The Lord is the Spirit”</dr class="alt5">), but the 

remainder of the verse cautions us against this view (<dr class="alt5">“Where the 

Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty”). <br>(2 Cor. 3:17)</dr class="alt5"><br> Although frequently 

the work of Christ and the work of the Spirit are quite 

interchangeable, the memory of the historical career of Jesus did 

not permit the fusing of the living Christ with the Holy Spirit 

in Christian thought and worship. <br> Nevertheless we can safely say 

that the Spirit describes the manner in which the risen Christ is 

present in the church today. The expression <dr class="alt5">“The Lord is the 

Spirit,”</dr class="alt5"><br> The Spirit communicates to men the benefits of the risen 

Christ; it bridges the gap between transcendence and 

immanence.</p>
<p>
Not only is Christ present in the church by the power of His 

Spirit, but the Spirit enables men to acknowledge and to confess 

Him as Lord. In 1 Cor. 12:3 Paul asserts that no one can say 

“Jesus is Lord” except by the Holy Spirit. To acknowledge Christ 

as Lord today is possible only because He died and rose again 

yesterday. And it implies that He will come tomorrow to judge the 

quick and the dead.</p> 
<p>
Another way of expressing the conviction that the messianic age, 

the age of the Spirit, had dawned in Christ was to proclaim that 

He had established a new covenant and that this covenant was a 

covenant of the Spirit.</p>
<h3>
The Spirit and the New Covenant.
</h3>
<p> 
Israel’s national existence, according to the Old Testament, 

began when God established His covenant with His people. When 

Israel became apostate, the prophets faced the dilemma of 

reconciling the fact that Israel had broken the covenant with 

Yahweh with the fact that Yahweh’s grace was unchanging.<br> Out of 

this situation the hopes of a new covenant were born and the 

prophetic outlook is Jer 31.</p>
<p>
The coming of the Spirit convinced the early church that this 

hope had been fulfilled in Christ. <br>The old covenant is described 

by Paul (2 Cor 3) as a covenant of death, written and engraved 

on stones. <br>The new is a covenant of the pneuma—an antithesis 

which he derives from <br>Jer 31:33. <br> The apostle goes on (2 Cor 

3:6) to compare the ministry of the old covenant with that of the 

new, which he calls a ministry of the Spirit.<br> In contrast to the 

ephemeral glory of the old covenant and its ministry, the 

ministry of the Spirit has a greater splendour (2 Cor 3:8).</p>
<h3>
The Spirit and the Awareness of the New Age.
</h3>
<p>
It was only when the Spirit was poured out that the apostles 

became convinced that by His passion Christ had inaugurated in 

the new age. Frequently the writers of the New Testament admit 

that the meaning of the Christ-event lay hidden in God and that 

it was only now at the turning point of the ages that God’s 

purposes had come to light<br>(cf. Eph. 1:8, 9; 3:9; Col. 1:26; 1 

Pet. 1:20).<br> Paul argues in 1 Cor. 2:7, 8 that only those who have 

God’s Spirit can understand what God did in Christ.<br> The rulers of 

this world acted foolishly because they were blind to what God 

was doing at the Cross.<br> The believers, who have God’s spirit, 

understand, for<dr class="alt5"> “God has revealed them to us through His Spirit” (1 

Cor 2:10)</dr class="alt5">. What is more, the Spirit provides the language that 

makes conversation about these truths possible. <br>Christian 

teaching is done <dr class="alt5">“not in words which man’s 

wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit” (1 Cor 2:13)</dr 

class="alt5">. <dr class="alt5"><br>The natural man does not receive 

the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; 

nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned. (1 

Cor 2:14)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
The reason the leaders did not know what they were doing when 

they crucified the Lord of glory is that they belong to <dr 

class="alt5">“this age” (1 Cor 2:6)</dr class="alt5">. The 

believers who have <dr class="alt5">the Spirit who is from 

God</dr class="alt5"> (<dr class="alt5">not the “spirit of the 

world,”</dr class="alt5"> i.e., the wisdom of this age, <dr 

class="alt5">(1 Cor 2:12)</dr class="alt5">) now understand the 

mysteries of God. What former generations did not see is now made 

known to apostles and prophets <dr class="alt5">“by the Spirit” 

(Eph. 3:5)</dr class="alt5">. But all believers, not only the 

primary witnesses of the Christ-event, can see what God did when 

He raised Christ from the dead through <dr class="alt5">“the 

Spirit of wisdom and revelation” (Eph. 1:17ff)</dr class="alt5">. <br>

In his second prayer in Ephesians, the writer asked God to 

strengthen the readers <dr class="alt5">with might through His 

Spirit, ... so that they may be filled with all the fullness of 

God (Eph 3:16,19)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
By the Spirit the early believers recognised that the new age had 

dawned, but the Spirit also gave them the assurance that there 

was more in the offing. The Spirit was but a foretaste of what 

lay beyond time. Paul prays that his Roman readers might abound 

in hope <dr class="alt5">“by the power of the Holy Spirit” (Rom 

15:13)</dr class="alt5">. The Spirit was the sign that the new 

age had been inaugurated, that the Christ is present with His own 

during the interim, and that this age (in which the new and old 

overlap) will be consummated.
<h2>
The Spirit and the Consummation of the Age
</h2>
<h3>
The Spirit and the Assurances of Hope
</h3>
<h4>
The Sealing with the Spirit. 
</h4>
<p>
One way of expressing the certainty 

of the Christian hope is to say that the people of God have been 

“sealed with the Spirit.” The Holy Spirit is the mark of the 

child of God. But the sealing has a reference to the end of the 

age, for God will deliver all those who have His stamp on them 

(cf. Rev. 7:4).</p>
<p>
The background for the concept of sealing may be seen in 

tattooing, or in the marking of Cain, or in the marking of Jewish 

house with blood at the first Passover, or in the marking of the 

foreheads of the faithful before the judgement (Ezek 9). The seal 

of the old covenant, circumcision, must also be taken into 

account. It is not surprising, since the believers are 

incorporated into the Christian community by baptism (which is 

often related to the work of the Spirit), that baptism came to be 

known as sealing. It does not follow, however, that whenever Paul 

speaks of the sealing with the Spirit that baptism is meant. That sealing has reference to 

confirmation is just as unconvincing. </p>
<p>
That the sealing with the Spirit is an assurance of the hope of 

the believer can be seen in that sealing is used in conjunction 

with the earnest (down payment) of the Spirit (2 Cor. 1:21f.).<br> It 

is even more explicitly stated in Eph 1: <dr 

class="alt5">“In Him you also trusted, after you heard the word 

of truth, the gospel of your salvation; in whom also, having 

believed, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is 

the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the 

purchased possession” (Eph 1:13-14)</dr class="alt5">. It is 

worth noticing here that the sealing with the Spirit takes place 

when men give ear to the word of truth, the Gospel.</p>
<p>
That the sealing has an eschatological reference is borne out 

even more clearly in Eph. 4, where the apostle informs us that we 

were sealed with the Spirit <dr class="alt5">“for the day of 

redemption.” (Eph. 4:30)</dr class="alt5">. The Christ-event, 

which lies in the past, is made real for us by the Spirit, which 

also assures us that final redemption awaits us at the end of 

this age. This word of assurance, however, is coupled with the 

admonition <dr class="alt5">“do not grieve the Holy Spirit!” 

(Eph. 4:30)</dr class="alt5"> Perhaps this is a word of caution 

not to understand the sealing with the Spirit mechanically, as 

teaching the unconditional eternal security of the believer.</p>
<h4>
The Earnest of the Spirit. 
</h4>
<p>
In two of the three passages which 

speak of the sealing with the Spirit, the Spirit is called the 

pledge. If we add 2 Cor. 5:5 to 2 Cor. 1:22 and Eph. 1:14, we 

have the three passages in which the Spirit is spoken of as the 

earnest. <br> In Gen. 38:17, 18 and 20 the substantive is used for 

the pledge which Judah gave Tamar. As a rule the word occurs as a 

verb in the Old Testament, but always with the basic idea of 

surety or guarantee. Nowhere, however, does it signify the 

partial payment of a money debt. It is as a loan-word in Greek 

that earnest-money becomes more than a pledge; it is a partial 

down payment.<br>A pledge is taken back when the contract is 

fulfilled, but earnest money is payment in advance of full 

payment. </p>
<p>
To say that God has given us the pledge of the Spirit (2 Cor. 

1:22; 5:5) means that the Spirit is only a foretaste of the 

fullness that is to come. <br>Eph. 1:14 says essentially the same 

thing. Pledge, then, reflects the tension between the already and 

the not yet of the believer’s experience in the present. The life 

of the believer in this age is marked by incompleteness with 

respect to knowledge, communion with God, and power and freedom 

in Christian living. The desire for eternal life has not yet been 

fulfilled. It is on these levels that the Spirit gives 

anticipation of completeness and fullness.</p>  
<h4>
The First fruits of the Spirit. 
</h4>
<p>
Intimately related to the concept 

of the Spirit as earnest is that of first fruits. The background 

for the metaphor is to be found in the Israelitic cult, where the 

first fruits were offered and consecrated to God <br>(Lev. 2:12; 

Deut. 26:1-11; Ezek. 45:1).<br> The first fruits were the guarantee 

that the full harvest would follow, and it is this aspect of the 

practice that Paul has in mind when he speaks of the Spirit as 

first fruits. Through the Spirit the life of the age to come has 

been made available to us in the midst of the decay and death of 

this present evil age, but we are not yet experiencing the 

harvest of the new age, just the first fruits. Since the harvest 

still lies in the future, the believers groan with the rest of 

creation; they experience the birth pangs of the messianic age <br>

(Rom. 8:22). <br>“<dr class="alt5">but we also who have the 

first fruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within 

ourselves, eagerly waiting for the adoption, the redemption of 

our body.” (Rom. 8:23)</dr class="alt5">. The life of the Spirit 

here on earth does not exhaust the fullness of God’s redemptive 

gifts, for we share the bondage to decay which afflicts all 

creation. But the Spirit is the guarantee that when our bodies 

are redeemed we will share in all the fullness of the age to 

come.</p>
<h4>
Spirit and Sonship.
</h4>
<p>
 Paul informs us that <dr class="alt5">“The 

Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children 

of God,” (Rom. 8:16)</dr class="alt5">. Does this mean that God’s 

Spirit witnesses conjointly with our own consciousness to the 

fact that we are God’s?  “Certitude of being a child of God does 

not rest on the testimony of our spirit but uniquely on the 

testimony of God’s Spirit.” <br> But how does He give that certitude 

if not by corroborating our inner conviction that God has made 

His children? Also, it appears to be overly precise to say that 

the witness which the Spirit gives our spirit is audibly 

expressed in the cry Abba, Father. <br>Although sonship is expressed 

in prayer to the Father, the Spirit witnesses with our spirit by 

reminding us of God’s love for us, of His promises and by making 

all the great verities of Christ’s redeeming grace real to 

us.</p>
<p>
Although sonship is a present possession, it is also a hope; <dr 

class="alt5">“waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our 

body.” (Rom. 8:23)</dr class="alt5">. Final acceptance into God’s 

family is the Christian’s hope—a hope that will be realised when 

the physical gives way to the spiritual (1 Cor. 15:44f.).</p>
<h4>
The Spirit and the Love of God. 
</h4>
<p>
What makes the Christian hope 

so strong that it bears the believer up in trials and 

tribulations? (Rom. 5:2-4).<dr class="alt5"> It is because God’s 

love has been poured into his heart by the Holy Spirit (Rom. 

5:5)</dr class="alt5">. The Holy Spirit gives the believer the 

assurance that God’s love has been demonstrated in all its 

fullness in Christ. The Spirit draws men into fellowship with 

Christ so that the demonstration of His love for sinners is not 

merely an historical event but a living reality.</p>
<h4>
The Spirit and the Resurrection. 
</h4>
<p>
In Rom. 8:11 Paul avers that 

the Spirit which indwells the believers is their assurance that 

God will raise their mortal bodies. <br>Perhaps the passage is 

reminiscent of Ezek 37,<dr class="alt5"> “I will put my Spirit in 

you, and you shall live.” (Ezek 37:14)</dr class="alt5"><br>

In 1 Cor 15 <dr class="alt5">“The first man Adam became a living 

being.” The last Adam became a life-giving spirit. (1 Cor 

15:45)</dr class="alt5">. Implied is that those who belong to Him 

will experience a similar transition from their earthly to their 

heavenly existence, and will receive a spiritual body.<br>

We notice, then, that the Holy Spirit is not only the sign of the 

arrival of the new age, but He is the believer’s assurance of the 

consummation of the age. The Christian hope is suspended, as it 

were, between two poles of deliverance—that already attained in 

Christ, and the other still in the future.<br> The Spirit gives 

substance to this hope.
<h2>
The Spirit and the Substance of Hope.
</h2>
<h4>
The Spirit and the Redemption of the Body.
</h4>
<p>
 We have already 

observed that the Spirit has sealed the people of God <dr 

class="alt5">“for the day of redemption” (Eph 4:30)</dr 

class="alt5">. Although we sigh with anxiety because we are still 

in this age, we have the hope that what is mortal will be 

swallowed up by life.<dr class="alt5"> “He who has prepared us for this very thing 

is God, who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee” (2 Cor 

5:5)</dr class="alt5">. Assured of the supply of <dr class="alt5">the Spirit of 

Jesus Christ (Phil 1:19)</dr class="alt5">, Paul could stare 

death in the face.<br> The Spirit assures us of the redemption of our 

bodies</p>
