   <h1> 
Baptism of Suffering
 </h1>
<p>          
<dr class="alt5">But I have a baptism to be baptised with, and how distressed I am till it is accomplished!" (Luke 12:50)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
Jesus' Baptism of Suffering
</h3>
 <p>
The baptism mentioned above is a symbolic baptism. At the time Jesus made this statement, both He and His disciples had already been baptised with the water baptism of John (Mark 1:9 and John 1:35-42).<br> Therefore, the baptism which He referred to here was His own demise on the brutal cross of Calvary.<br> After His crucifixion <dr class="alt5">He said to them, “O foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken! Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into His glory?" (Luke 24:25-26)</dr class="alt5"><br> Paul later wrote of Him, <dr class="alt5">"But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honour, that He, by the grace of God, might taste death for everyone." (Heb 2:9)</dr class="alt5">.<br> And while He may have dreaded this hour of suffering, He wilfully submitted Himself to the same, <dr class="alt5">"Now My soul is troubled, and what shall I say? "Father, save Me from this hour"? But for this purpose I came to this hour" (John 12:27)</dr class="alt5">. Thus, this baptism was fulfilled and accomplished in our Lord's death upon the cross.</p>
<h3>
Disciples Baptism of Suffering
</h3>
<p>            
 Jesus warned His disciples that they too would have to drink of this cup of affliction, <dr class="alt5">"Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you ask. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, and be baptised with the baptism that I am baptised with?” They said to Him, “We are able.” So Jesus said to them,“You will indeed drink the cup that I drink, and with the baptism I am baptised with you will be baptised;" (Mark 10:38-39)</dr class="alt5">.<br>
 True to His words, His disciples did indeed partake of this baptism. Tradition tells us that Peter was crucified upside down. If this is true, then our Lord's prophecy concerning Peter's demise was fulfilled in it's most minute detail,<dr class="alt5"> <br>"Most assuredly, I say to you, when you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish.” This He spoke, signifying by what death he would glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He said to him, “Follow Me.”" (John 21:18-19)</dr class="alt5">. </p>
<p>
Likewise, history tells us that all of the apostles suffered Martyrdom for the cause of Christ, save John. However, he too was persecuted in the name of Christianity, being exiled to the isle of Patmos for the word of God (Rev 1:9).<br> In this manner, all the disciples were baptised with this same baptism of suffering.</p>
<h3>
Our Baptism of Suffering
</h3> 
<p>           
Bar a premature death or fortunes of circumstance, we too must partake of this baptism, <dr class="alt5">"Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution." (2 Tim 3:12)</dr class="alt5">. <br>John exhorted those of Smyrna to remain faithful in this suffering, even unto the point of death, <dr class="alt5">"Do not fear any of those things which you are about to suffer. Indeed, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and you will have tribulation ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life." (Rev 2:10)</dr class="alt5">. <br>However, it could be that a person is baptised, dies unexpectedly, and completely avoids this baptism. Thus, while most faithful Christians will experience this baptism, some may be fortunate enough to escape its clutches. Therefore, it cannot be the one baptism which is demanded of all men today. <dr class="alt5">There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. (Eph 4:4-6)</dr class="alt5">.
