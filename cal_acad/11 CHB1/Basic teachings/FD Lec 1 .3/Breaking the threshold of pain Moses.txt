Breaking the threshold of pain <br>Moses
</h1>
<p>
Sometimes God breaks into our ordinary lives in extraordinary ways to capture our attention and deliver important messages. That's what happened when the prophet Moses was at work one day tending his flock of sheep outside. Suddenly, Moses saw a bush that was on fire, yet not consumed by the flames. When Moses moved closer to take a better look, he found himself communicating with God, appearing in the form of the Angel of the Lord. </p>
<h3>
God Calling
</h3>
<p>
The Bible and the Torah begin the story in Ex 3<dr class="alt5"> "Now Moses was tending the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian. And he led the flock to the back of the desert, and came to Horeb, the mountain of God. And the Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush. So he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, but the bush was not consumed. Then Moses said, “I will now turn aside and see this great sight, why the bush does not burn.” So when the Lord saw that he turned aside to look, God called to him from the midst of the bush and said, “Moses, Moses!” And he said, “Here I am.”(Ex 3:1-4)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
The burning bush powerfully captured Moses' attention because "it was a physical miracle that communicated spiritual truth" writes Philip Graham Ryken in his book Exodus: Saved for God's Glory: "This miraculous sign pointed to God’s power by revealing his control over creation. Who else but God has the power to make a bush burn without being consumed? It also pointed to God’s glory by giving a glimpse of the brightness of his splendour. ... The miraculous sign pointed as well to God’s eternity and self-sufficiency. Like the burning bush, God never runs out of fuel. His glory never dims; his beauty never fades. He always keeps burning bright. This is because God does not get his energy from anyone or anything outside himself."</p>
<h3>
Standing on Holy Ground
</h3>
<p>
The story continues in Ex 3, where the Angel of the Lord reveals his identity to Moses: "'Then He said, “Do not draw near this place. Take your sandals off your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground.” Moreover He said, “I am the God of your father—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God." (Ex 3:5-6)</p>
<p>
In Exodus: Saved for God's Glory, Ryken comments: "It is not surprising that there was something divine about the bush, for the Bible says that was none other than the 'angel of the LORD' (Ex 3:2). ... Here the angel of the Lord is so closely identified with God that the burning bush is generally considered a theophany. In other words, it was a God-appearance, a visible manifestation of an invisible God. For a few brief moments in time and space, the bush was the temple of the living God, the place of his presence on Earth. Since the time of the early church, Christians have wondered whether perhaps this was a revelation of God’s pre-incarnate Son, who brings God’s saving message to humanity. Whether or not Christ was in the bush, one thing was certain: Moses was in the presence of God."</p>
<h3>
God's Rescue Plan
</h3>
<p>
Next, God tells Moses that he has seen the Hebrew people's suffering in slavery while living in Egypt, and he cares about what they've been going through. God announces a plan to rescue the Hebrew people and work through Moses to lead them to freedom in a land that he promises to give them (which has come to be called "the Promised Land").</p>
<p>
The Bible and the Torah record in Ex 3: <dr class="alt5">"And the Lord said: “I have surely seen the oppression of My people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows. So I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up from that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites. Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to Me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them. Come now, therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.”
But Moses said to God, “Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?”
So He said, “I will certainly be with you. And this shall be a sign to you that I have sent you: When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain." (Ex 3:7-12) </dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
This dialogue between Moses and the Angel of the Lord shows people how much God cares about them, writes Stuart Tyner in his book Searching for the God of Grace: Before Our Hopes, Before Our Fears, Before Religion: "The angel of the Lord is none other than God himself! And here’s what we learn ... We learn that God initiates contact with us ... Sometimes God appears to us physically. Sometimes that physical appearing is calculated to attract our attention. ('I will go over and see this strange sight -- why, the bush does not burn up.') We learn that God’s appearance makes the places of our lives holy because He is there. We learn that we stand properly before this holy God when there is nothing between us. ('Take off your sandals.') When we pay attention, we find out that God knows our names. ('Moses! Moses!'). He sees His people. He hears us. He’s concerned about us. It is God who rescues us. It is God who takes us to the Promised Land. ... The angel of the Lord also teaches us that it’s OK to ask God questions and that God answers."</p>
<h3>
The Great 'I Am'
</h3>
<p>
The story continues in Ex 3 with Moses asking the Angel of the Lord for his name and receiving an unusual reply:<br><dr class="alt5">
"Then Moses said to God, “Indeed, when I come to the children of Israel and say to them, "The God of your fathers has sent me to you", and they say to me, "What is His name"? what shall I say to them?” And God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM.” And He said, “Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, "I AM has sent me to you.” Moreover God said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: "The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This is My name forever, and this is My memorial to all generations." (Ex 3: 13-15)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
In his book The Light of the World, Leonard E. Rook comments: "The One who spoke to Moses declared Himself to the be the Eternal One, uncaused and independent. Only the Creator of all things can call Himself the 'I AM' in the absolute sense. When we speak of God, we say 'He is.' All other creatures in God’s creation are in a position of obligation to Him for their existence."</p>
<p>
Many Bible scholars think that the Angel of the Lord is God's Son, Jesus Christ, appearing in angelic form prior to His incarnation later in history. One of the connections to Jesus is the angel's answer here that His name is "I AM" and Jesus' reply in John 8:58 to Jewish people asking about his identity: "before Abraham was born, I AM!".</p>

A Better Future to Come

<p>
Moses' encounter with the burning bush ends with the Angel of the Lord describing the details of what will happen in the future when Moses leads the Hebrew people out of slavery to freedom -- details that all became historic reality when the time came.
