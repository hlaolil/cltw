<h3>
The birth of Isaac
</h3>
For twenty-five years Abraham had been in the Promised Land without the promised heir. God had promised that He would bless all the nations of the earth through him, and yet He did not give him a son. Abraham’s faith almost staggered a number of times. Ishmael was born, but God set aside the son of the bondwoman, for he was not to be the ancestor of the Son of God. God was setting Abram apart simply that He might prepare the way for His own Son, and now, at last, a messenger comes down from heaven to Hebron, and tells Abraham in his old age that he should have a son.</p>
<p>
It seemed too good to be true. He had hard work believing it; but at the appointed time Isaac was born into that family. I don’t believe there was ever a child born into the world that caused so much joy in the home as in Abraham’s heart and home. How Abraham and that old mother, Sarah, must have doted on that child! How their eyes feasted on him!</p>
<h3>
God's command to sacrifice Isaac
</h3>
But just when the lad was growing up into manhood Abraham received a very strange command, concerning his son Isaac.
One night the old patriarch retired to bed when suddenly a heavenly messenger came and told him that he must take that boy off on to a mountain that God was to show him, and offer him up as a sacrifice.</p>
<p>
Perhaps he was making an idol of that boy, and thought more of him than he did of the God that gave him. There must be no idol in the heart if we are going to do the will of God on earth. <br> He didn’t tell the servants, even the faithful servant Eliezer, what was to take place.</p>
<h3>
The Journey
</h3> 
<p>
Those four men— Abraham, Isaac and the two young men with them—started off on the long three day journey. 

The third night came, and what a night it must have been! 
What a next morning it must have been for that father!  
They has not gone a long way before he lifted up his eyes, and there was Mount Moriah. He told the two young men:
“You stay here, and I will go yonder with my son.”</p>
<h3>
Mount Moriah
</h3>
Then, as father and son went up Mount Moriah, with the wood, and the fire, and the knife, the boy turned suddenly to the father, and said:
“Father, where is the lamb? We haven’t any offering, father.”
It was a common thing for Isaac to see his father offer up a sacrifice, but there is no lamb now.
Did you ever think <font size="+1">HOW PROPHETIC THAT ANSWER WAS</font>
Abraham turned and said to the son, “God will provide Himself a sacrifice?” I don’t know that Abraham understood the full meaning of it, but hundreds of years after God did provide a sacrifice right there. Mount Moriah and Mount Calvary are close together, and God’s Son was provided as a sacrifice for the world.</p>
<h3>
Building the altar
</h3>
On Mount Moriah this father and son begin to roll up the stones, and together they built the altar; then they layed on the wood and everything was ready for the sacrifice. 
Abraham called Isaac and said:
“My boy, sit down here close to the altar, and let me tell you something.”
“My son, the last night we were at home God came to me in the hours of the night and told me to bring you here and offer you up as a sacrifice. I don’t understand what it means, but I can tell you one thing: it is much harder for me to offer you up than it would be for me to be sacrificed myself.”</p>
<p>
There was a time when I used to think more of the love of Jesus Christ than of God the Father. I used to think of God as a stern judge on the throne, from whose wrath Jesus Christ had saved me. It seems to me now I could not have A FALSER IDEA OF GOD than that. Since I have become a father I have made this discovery: that it takes more love and self-sacrifice for the father to give up the son than it does for the son to die. Is a father on earth a true father that would not rather suffer than to see his child suffer? Do you think that it did not cost God something to redeem this world? It cost God the most precious possession He ever had. When God gave His Son, He gave all, and yet He gave Him freely for you and me.</p>
<p>
“But God has commanded it,” he says, “and I surrender my will to God’s will. I don’t understand it, but I believe that God will be able to raise you up, and maybe He will.”
They fell on their faces, and prayed together.</p>
<h3>
The Sacrifice
</h3>
<p>
Abraham bound Isaac's hands and feet, and laid him on the altar. Then he took the knife, and raised his hand to sacrifice Isaac.<br>
 No sooner is his hand lifted than a voice calls from heaven:
“Abraham, Abraham, spare your son!”</p>
<p>
You remember that Christ said, “Abraham saw my day, and was glad.” I have an idea that God then and there just LIFTED THE CURTAIN OF TIME for Abraham. He looked down into the future, saw God’s Son coming up Calvary, bearing his sins and the sins of all posterity. God gave him that secret, and told him how His Son was to come into the world and take away his sins.</p>
<p>
Because Abraham obeyed God and held back not even his only child, God enlarged His promises once again:
“And the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time, and said, By myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, for because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son, thine only son: that in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the gate of his enemies; and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed; because thou hast obeyed my voice.”</p>
<p>
If you take my advice, you will have no will other than God’s will. Make a full and complete surrender, and the sweet messages of heaven will come to you. God will whisper into your soul THE SECRETS OF HEAVEN.</p>
<p>
After Abraham did what God told him, then it was that God told His friend all about His Son. If we make a full surrender, God will give us something better than we have ever known before. We will get a new vision of Jesus Christ, and will thank God not only in this life but in the life to come. May God help each and every one of us to make a full and complete and unconditional surrender to God, fully and wholly, now and forever.</p>
