<dr class="alt5">Therefore, since a promise remains of entering His rest, let us fear lest any of you seem to have come short of it. (Heb 4:1)</dr class="alt5">

Most of the Israelites who left Egypt with Moses died in the wilderness before they came to the Land of Promise. They did not enter in because of unbelief. They did not believe God; they did not trust His promises, power, or providence. 
This example is given by Paul to show the evil nature of unbelief and to warn us who profess faith in Christ <dr class="alt5">Beware, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God; but exhort one another daily, while it is called “Today,” lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.(Heb 3:12-13)</dr class="alt5">.</p>

The Lord rebuked Moses for his unbelief that He couldn’t feed the complaining people.
But Moses said, "Here I am among six hundred thousand men on foot, and you say, 'I will give them meat to eat for a whole month!' Would they have enough if flocks and herds were slaughtered for them? Would they have enough if all the fish in the sea were caught for them?" The LORD answered Moses, "Is the LORD'S arm too short? You will now see whether or not what I say will come true for you." (Num 11:21-23)</p>

Asaph, King David’s musician, wrote this psalm about the unbelieving Israelites with Moses in the wilderness.   
<dr class="alt5">They spoke against God, saying, "Can God spread a table in the desert? When he struck the rock, water gushed out, and streams flowed abundantly. But can he also give us food? Can he supply meat for his people?" When the LORD heard them, he was very angry; his fire broke out against Jacob, and his wrath rose against Israel, for they did not believe in God or trust in his deliverance. (Psa 78:19 – 22)</dr class="alt5"></p>

The generation out of Egypt, including Moses, died before they reached the Promised Land because of unbelief and dissension.
<dr class="alt5">They tried Me, though they saw My work. For forty years I was grieved with that generation,and said,"It is a people who go astray in their hearts, and they do not know My ways."So I swore in My wrath, "They shall not enter My rest.” (Psa 95:6 – 11)</dr class="alt5">
