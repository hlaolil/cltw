God rebukes Defeat
</h1> 
<p>
<dr class="alt5">So about three thousand men went up there from the people, but they fled before the men of Ai. (Joshua 7:4)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
Defeat at Ai
</h3>
<p>
The battle at Ai wasn't even much of a battle. Three thousand of them went up to Ai, but as soon as the Canaanites came out, the Israelites ran. Thirty-six Israelites died, and suddenly the entire congregation was afraid.
Saints, I can't repeat these two verses often enough:<br>
 "... for without Me you can do nothing. (John 15:5)<br>
 <dr class="alt5"> I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. (Phil 4:13)</dr class="alt5"><br>
When will we learn that it is not our strength, it is not our ability, it is not our intellect, it is not our education, it is not our insight, it is not our logic, it is not our brilliance that gets us the victory? It is only Jesus Christ.</p>
<h3>
Joshua's Sorrow
</h3>
<p>
Joshua was a wreck, not understanding what happened. It seemed that God turned His back on them, broke His promises, and let them down. He blames the situation on God, and fearing for the lives of the Israelites. He prays the same prayer that many of us have when we've faced defeat in our lives.
But this is not how we are to discover the reason for our defeat. We must focus the attention not on God falling short, but on us. "Lord, search my heart, test my mind. Have I sinned? Have I not repented? Did I step out ahead of You? Did I disobey Your directions? Lord, please show me what I have done."</p>
<h3>
 They could not Stand
</h3>
<p>
God tells Joshua to stop the pity party. The reason for the defeat is sin in the camp. Because of that sin, God says,
<dr class="alt5"> "Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their enemies ..." (Josh. 7:12)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Do you know that you cannot stand before your enemies with sin either? Your enemy the devil will take advantage of your sin and manipulate you with it. He'll knock you down with unconfessed, unrepentant sin every time. That's why the book of Ephesians tells us that to stand, we must have the full armour of God on.
 <dr class="alt5">Put on the whole armour of God, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil. 12 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age,[a] against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. 13 Therefore take up the whole armour of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.
Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth, having put on the breastplate of righteousness, 15 and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace; 16 above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one. And take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God; (Eph 6:11-17)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
If you're going to stand before your enemies, you need the armour of God on. You need to be walking rightly before God. That means living in truth instead of lies and misleading. That means righteousness, not living in sin. That means being prepared to share the gospel, not having your head buried in a novel or spending hours in front of the TV. That means protecting yourself with faith and salvation, because the devil wants to kill you. If you're living in this manner, you will be able to stand before your enemies.
If they do not rid themselves of the sin, God says, "You will be on your own. I won't be with you any more." How often we go venturing out on our own, totally leaving God behind because of our sin.</p>
