Faith Toward God
</h1>
<p><dr class="alt5">
Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ,
let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation
of repentance from dead works, and of<font color="firebrick"> faith toward God</font>, of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgement. (Heb 6:1-2)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Faith towards God is probably the most basic doctrine in Christianity. It is your faith in Jesus Christ and His sacrifice on the cross that saves you. Without faith, you cannot overcome this world. Faith in God means believing Him, trusting Him, and obeying Him.</p>
<p>
Faith is believing and trusting in Christ while we cannot see Him at the present time. <br><dr class="alt5">Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen (Heb 11:1).</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p> <dr class="alt5">For we walk by faith, not by sight (2 Cor 5:7)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p> Even though we cannot see Him know, we know He is there, guiding our daily lives. He will guide you if you let Him. We believe that there is a God, yet have not seen Him. We believe in a Heaven, but have never been there.<br><dr class="alt5"> But as it is written, Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for those who love him. But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God (1 Cor 2:9,10)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p> Although we have not seen it, we accept it though faith.</p>
<p>
Likewise, we believe in God though faith. Although there <dr class="alt5"> are some things hard to understand (2 Pet 3:16)</dr class="alt5">.
 <br>Yet we believe God out of faith. So when we find things in the Bible that we can’t fully comprehend, we still believe the rest of it. When we find things that seem improvable, or contradict everything we have ever been taught, we believe it, for <dr class="alt5">Your word is truth (John 17:17)</dr class="alt5">.<br> The statements in the Bible that have been proven scientifically or otherwise help increase our faith in those things that haven’t been proven. (For a good faith increaser, read “That Amazing Book” by Terry Watkins. Another good on is Kent Hovind’s Creation Seminar. You can watch it in it’s entirety for free on his website.)</p>
<p>
Faith doesn’t just mean believing in a God. Faith also means <font size="+1">TRUSTING</font> and <font size="+1">OBEYING</font> God. You can “believe” in God all you want, but it will not do you any good.<br> The devils also believe in God: <dr class="alt5">“You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe—and tremble!” (James 2:19)</dr class="alt5">.<br>You show your faith by trusting and obeying Him. By works is your faith made manifest. Jesus said <dr class="alt5">“You are My friends if you do whatever I command you.” (John 15:14)</dr class="alt5"> and <dr class="alt5">“If you know these things, blessed are you if you do them” (John 13:17)</dr class="alt5">. <br>Just reading the Bible and listening to sermons is not enough. You can’t say you believe it if you don’t obey it.<dr class="alt5"> “But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves” (James 1:22)</dr class="alt5">.
</p><p>
Hebrews Chapter 11 is known as the “Faith Chapter.” In it are many examples of people, who through faith, trusted and obeyed God. For example, Noah building the ark (Heb 11:7), and the Israelites crossing the Red Sea (Heb 11:29). These all showed their faith in God by trusting and obeying Him.</p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
"Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths ..." <br>(Prov 3:5-6)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Trusting in and obeying God will help you, not hinder you.<br> <dr class="alt5">“For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. <br>And His commandments are not burdensome.” (1John 5:3)</dr class="alt5">.
<br> Christ’s burden is light:
<dr class="alt5">
"Come to Me, all you who labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light.” (Matt 11:28-30)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
When you put your trust fully in God, He will take away the fear of man, which prevents you from doing His will.<br> <dr class="alt5">“In God (I will praise His word), in God I have put my trust; I will not fear. What can flesh do to me?” (Psa 56:4, see also Heb 13:6)</dr class="alt5">.<br> Trusting in God is your protection and your shield: <br><dr class="alt5">“As for God, His way is perfect; the word of the Lord is proven; He is a shield to all who trust in Him.” (Psa 18:30)</dr class="alt5">. </p>
<p>
Eph 6:16 says that the <font size="+1">SHIELD OF FAITH</font> is your protection from the fiery darts of the devil:<dr class="alt5"> “above all, taking the shield of faith with which you will be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one.” (Eph 6:16)</dr class="alt5"> “Above all” hints that faith is the greatest weapon in the believer’s arsenal.</p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
Cast your burden on the Lord, and He shall sustain you; He shall never permit the righteous to be moved. (Psa 55:22)</dr class="alt5"><br>
Miracles happen by faith, and they don’t happen without it. If you ask without doubting, you will get your request. Examples are breakthroughs in your life, help with troublesome Scriptures, and receiving the Holy Spirit.<br>
<dr class="alt5">
“Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. For everyone who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened. (Matt 7:7-8)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
So Jesus answered and said to them,<br> <dr class="alt5">“Assuredly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what was done to the fig tree, but also if you say to this mountain, ‘Be removed and be cast into the sea,’ it will be done. And whatever things you ask in prayer, believing, you will receive.” (Matt 21:21-22)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">
But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for he who doubts is like a wave of the sea driven and tossed by the wind. (James 1:6)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
You have to be asking according to the will of God. If you are asking for a huge mansion or a million dollars, or a big screen TV, you probably will not get it. God is not your genie, and He will not give you your every whim and desire. Those who tell you that He will are liars. God will not grant your requests so that you can satisfy your own carnal lusts: <dr class="alt5">“You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures.” (James 4:3)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p><font color="red">
Faith is the most important doctrine in Christianity. It is the substance of things we hope for, the evidence of things not seen.  So lets all have faith in God.</font></p>
