<h1>
First born of the Resurrection
</h1>
<p>
Because Jesus was the Christ, His resurrection is not, as previous raisings of the dead, an isolated occurrence, but in it the time of salvation promised in Him, the new creation, dawns in an overwhelming manner, as a decisive transition from the old to the new world (2 Cor. 5:17; cf. v 15). It is in this light too, that those passages are to be understood where Paul calls Christ the First born, the First fruits.</p>
<h3>
The Beginning
</h3>
<p>
... that He might be the First born among many brethren (Rom. 8:29)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
...but now Christ is risen from the dead, and has become the First fruits of those who have fallen asleep (1 Cor. 15:20).</p>
<p>
...who is the Beginning, the First born from the dead, that in everything He may have the pre eminence. (Col. 1:18).</p>
<p>
In connection with the name First born one is not to think here merely of an order of birth but, as may appear from a comparison with certain Old Testament pronouncements (as, for example, Ex 4:22; Psa 89:22), of an order of rank or dignity. To be sure, this name also indicates the relationship to others who in Rom 8:29 are called "many brethren." As the First born among those many, however, Christ not only occupies a special place and dignity, but He also goes before them, He opens up the way for them, He joins their future to His own.</p>
<p>
Now, while in Rom 8:29 the thought is of the glorification that is still to be expected, in Col 1:18 this position as First born is related specifically to the resurrection, and this pronouncement is amplified still further with the words "who is the Beginning." We shall have to understand both qualifications in close relationship with each other, and must thus see in "the Beginning" a denotation of the significance of Christ's resurrection as well. Our word "beginning" is no adequate translation of it.</p>
<p>
For what is intended is not merely that Christ was the First or formed a beginning in terms of chronological order; he was rather the Pioneer, the Inaugurator, who opened up the way. With Him the great Resurrection became reality. And very similar is the meaning of First born from the dead; He ushers in the world of the resurrection. He has brought life and incorruptibility to light (2 Tim. 1:10). In a somewhat different way the same idea is given expression by "First fruits" (of those who have fallen asleep). Here the picture of the harvest is in the background. The first fruits are not only its beginning, but its representation. In the first fruits the whole harvest becomes visible. So Christ is the First fruits of them that slept. In Him the resurrection of the dead dawns, His resurrection represents the commencement of the new world of God.</p>
<p>
Nowhere is this more clearly voiced than in the passages in which Christ is set over against Adam. Paul speaks in I Cor 15:45 ff. of Adam as "the first man," and of Christ as "the last Adam," the "second man." The expression "the last Adam" is again highly typical of the eschatological character of Paul's preaching: Christ is thereby designated as the Inaugurator of the new humanity. And it is once more His resurrection from the dead that has made Him this last Adam:
For since by man came death, by Man also came the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive (1 Cor 15:21-22).</p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
...the first man, Adam, became a living soul; the last Adam a life-giving spirit.(1 Cor. 15:45 ff.</dr class="alt5">) The first man is from the earth, earthy; the second man is from heaven ... And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</p>
<p>
The intention of the apostle is here again not merely to point to the resurrection of Christ as the token or as the possibility of the future resurrection of all believers. Rather, Christ as second man and last Adam is the one in whose resurrection this new life of the re-creation has already come to light and become reality in this dispensation.</p>
<p>
This is also the clear purport of Rom 5:12 ff. As Adam is the one through whom sin entered into the world and death through sin, so Christ is the one who gives righteousness and life. Christ and Adam stand over against one another as the great representatives of the two aeons, that of life and that of death. In that sense, as representing a whole dispensation, a whole humanity. Adam can be called the type of <dr class="alt5">"Him who was to come" (Rom 5:14)</dr class="alt5">, i.e., of the second man and of the coming aeon represented by Him. For as the proto-father brought sin and death into the world, so Christ by His obedience (that is, by His death) and His resurrection has made life to dawn for the new humanity.</p>
<p>
In summary we can say, therefore, that Paul's kerygma (preaching or proclamation of the Christian gospel.) of the great time of salvation that has dawned in Christ is above all determined by Christ's death and resurrection. It is in them that the present aeon has lost it power and hold on the children of Adam and that the new things have come. For this reason, too, the entire unfolding of the salvation that has dawned with Christ again and again harks back to His death and resurrection, because all the facets in which this salvation appears and all the names by which it is described are ultimately nothing other than the unfolding of what this all-important breakthrough of life in death, of the kingdom of God in this present world, contains within itself.</p>
<p>
Here all lines come together, and from hence the whole Pauline proclamation of redemption can be described in its unity and coherence. Paul's preaching, so we have seen, is "eschatology," because it is preaching of the fulfilling redemptive work of God in Christ. We might be able to delimit this further, to a certain extent schematically, by speaking of Paul's "resurrection-eschatology." For it is in Christ's death and subsequent resurrection that the mystery of the redemptive plan of God has manifested itself in its true character and that the new creation has come to light</p>
