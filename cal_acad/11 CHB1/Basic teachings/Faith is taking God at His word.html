   <h1>
Faith is taking God at His word
</h1>
<h3>
How would you define faith?
</h3>
<p>
A story comes to mind in which Jesus spoke to the crowd following Him saying,<dr class="alt5"> “Not even in Israel have I found such great faith.”</dr class="alt5"><br> What was it that Jesus had called “great faith”?</p>
<p>
I looked up the passage in Luke 7 about the centurion who was willing to believe that Jesus could heal a loyal and trusted servant who was near death. <br>The centurion asked Jesus to,<dr class="alt5"> “say the word, and my servant will be healed.” <br>(Luke 7:7)</dr class="alt5"><br>
Then the centurion used a personal example to illustrate that he understood what it meant to be taken at his word and obeyed.<br><dr class="alt5">For I also am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to one, Go, and he goes; and to another, Come, and he comes ... " (Luke 7:8)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">When Jesus heard these things, He marvelled at him, and turned around and said to the crowd that followed Him, “I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!” (Luke 7:9)</dr class="alt5"> <br>Jesus seemed to be saying that “great faith” was simply taking Him at His word.</p>
<h3>
Taking God at His Word
</h3>
<p>
After reading the passage, with all its references to the phrase “by faith,”<br> I began to see that all the people mentioned had one thing in common:<br> No matter whom the writer of Hebrews was talking about, each person had simply taken God at His word and obeyed His command. And they were remembered for their faith.</p>
<p>
For example, God told Noah to build an ark because He was going to bring a massive flood. Noah took God at His word and built the ark <dr class="alt5">and became heir of the righteousness which is according to faith. (Heb 11:7)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
God told Abraham to go out to a place that he would receive as an inheritance. <dr class="alt5">By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go. (Heb 11:8)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
God indicated to Sarah, who was long past the age of childbearing, that she would conceive a son.<br> The Scripture states: <dr class="alt5">“She judged Him faithful who had promised.” (Heb 11:11)</dr class="alt5"> She took God at His word.</p>
<p>
Regardless of circumstances, despite arguments of logic and reason, and regardless of how he or she felt, each person mentioned in Hebrews 11 believed God and His word and chose to be obedient.<br>

I began to wonder, If Luke 7 and Hebrews 11 illustrate great faith, is there a passage that illustrates a lack of faith?</p>
<p>
Jesus had just finished a full day of preaching and teaching by the shores of Galilee. He instructed the disciples to go to the other side of the sea.<br> Initially, they took Jesus at His word, got into a boat with Him, and headed for the other side. But when a storm arose, they grew fearful and lost confidence that they would actually reach the shore. <br>When Jesus asked them, <dr class="alt5">“Why are you so fearful? How is it that you have no faith?” (Mark 4:40)</dr class="alt5"> He could just as easily have said, “Why are you not taking Me at My word?”<br>
Mark 5 says<dr class="alt5"> “And they came to the other side of the sea,” (Mark 5:1)</dr class="alt5"> Jesus’ word proved to be true.

Through the studying of these three passages, I arrived at a simple, workable definition of faith: Faith is taking God at His word.</p> 
<h3>
What does God say about His Word?
</h3>
<p>
If faith is a matter of taking God at His word, what does God say about His word? I found the answer in Scripture itself:</p>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">“Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will by no mean pass away.” (Matt 24:35)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
“But the word of the Lord endures forever.” (1 Peter 1:25)</dr class="alt5"></p>      
<p><dr class="alt5">
“The grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of our God stands forever” (Isaiah 40:8)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
These verses tell us that everything in life may change, but God’s Word remains constant. His truth never changes. Therefore faith in God’s promises could affect us for the rest of our lives.<br>
As strong and as fluctuating as our feelings are,<br> <font color="firebrick">
God’s Word is truer than anything we feel<br>
God’s Word is truer than anything we experience<br>
God’s Word is truer than any circumstance we will ever face<br>
God’s Word is truer than anything in the world</font><br>
Why? Because heaven and earth will pass away, but God’s Word will not. This means that no matter how we feel or what we experience, we can choose to depend on the Word of God as the unchanging reality of our lives.</p>
<h3>
What about feelings?
</h3>
<p>
Your Word says that You love me. In fact, You’ve said that: <br><dr class="alt5">Yes, I have loved you with an everlasting love; (Jer 31:3)</dr class="alt5"> <br>
<dr class="alt5">And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love. (1 Cor 13)</dr class="alt5"><br> 
<dr class="alt5">“In truth I perceive that God shows no partiality. (Acts 10:34)</dr class="alt5"><br> That means You don’t love anyone else in the world more than you love me. <br>So, Lord, I thank You that I am loved by You. </p>
<p>
I began to realise that this kind of response to my feelings gave me the freedom both to be honest with God about my feelings and to choose to believe God’s Word when my feelings contradict His promises.</p>
<h3>
How do we respond?
</h3>
<p>
The Bible promises that, for those of us who truly love God, everything that happens in our lives will have the effect of moulding us into Christ’s image. (Rom 8:28-29)<br> Some of us may have prayed a prayer similar to this: “Lord, I pray You’d make me more like You. I pray that You would conform me to the image of Christ.” Often, what we really want is for God to give us an anaesthetic so we can be unconscious while He performs surgery on our hearts in order to conform us to Christ’s perfect character. We don’t want to wake up until the transformation is complete! We want the result but not the painful process.</p>
<p>
But God doesn’t work that way. The Lord is concerned about what we go through, but I believe He is more concerned about how we respond to what we go through. That response is a matter of our wills. He allows the trials, temptations, and pressures of life to come so that we have the opportunity to respond either by trusting our feelings and life experiences or by taking Him at His word.</p>
<p>
I have learned to get into the habit of taking God at His word—and now it is a habit! You and I can either grow accustomed to listening to our feelings, thoughts, and circumstances, letting them control us, or we can be in the habit of taking God at His word despite our feelings and life experiences. We need to choose with our wills to believe that His Word is truer than our feelings. Over and over I have found God to be faithful to His Word.</p>
