   <h1>
Breaking the threshold of pain<br> Abraham
</h1>
<p>
<h3>
The birth of Isaac
</h3>
<p>
For many years Abraham had been in the Promised Land without the promised heir. God had promised that He would bless all the nations of the earth through him, and yet He did not give him a son. Abraham’s faith almost staggered a number of times. Ishmael was born, but God set aside the son of the bondwoman, for he was not to be the ancestor of the Son of God. <br>God was setting Abram apart simply that He might prepare the way for His own Son, and now, at last, a messenger comes down from heaven to Hebron, and tells Abraham in his old age that he should have a son.</p>
<p>
It seemed too good to be true. He had hard work believing it; but at the appointed time Isaac was born into that family. I don’t believe there was ever a child born into the world that caused so much joy in the home as in Abraham’s heart and home. How Abraham and that old mother, Sarah, must have doted on that child! How their eyes feasted on him!</p>
<h3>
God's command to sacrifice Isaac
</h3>
<p>
But just when the lad was growing up into manhood Abraham received a very strange command, concerning his son Isaac.<br>
<dr class="alt5">God tested Abraham, and said to him, “Abraham!” and he said, “Here I am.” Then He said, “Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and go to the land of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.” (Gen 22:1-2)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Perhaps he was making an idol of that boy, and thought more of him than he did of the God that gave him. There must be no idol in the heart if we are going to do the will of God on earth. </p>
<h3>
The Journey
</h3> 
<p>
<dr class="alt5">So Abraham rose early in the morning and saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son; and he split the wood for the burnt offering, and arose and went to the place of which God had told him. Then on the third day Abraham lifted his eyes and saw the place afar off. And Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here with the donkey; the lad and I will go yonder and worship, and we will come back to you.” (Gen 22:3-5)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
Mount Moriah
</h3>
<p>
As father and son went up Mount Moriah, with the wood, and the fire, and the knife,<dr class="alt5"> “Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, “My father!” and he said, “Here I am, my son.” Then he said, “Look, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?” And Abraham said, “My son, God will provide for Himself the lamb for a burnt offering.” So the two of them went together.” <br>(Gen 22:7-8)</dr class="alt5">
<p>
Did you ever think how<font size="+1"> PROPHETIC</font> that was?</p>
<p>
Hundreds of years later God did provide a sacrifice right there. Mount Moriah and Mount Calvary are close together, and God’s Son was provided as a sacrifice for the world.</p>
<h3>
Building the altar
</h3>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">Then they came to the place of which God had told him. And Abraham built an altar there and placed the wood in order; and he bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, upon the wood. (Gen 22:9)</dr class="alt5">
</p>
<p>
There was a time when I used to think more of the love of Jesus Christ than of God the Father. I used to think of God as a stern judge on the throne, from whose wrath Jesus Christ had saved me.<br> It seems to me now I could not have a <font size="+1">FALSER </font>idea of God than that. Since I have become a father I have made this discovery: that it takes more love and self-sacrifice for the father to give up the son than it does for the son to die.<br> Is a father on earth a true father that would not rather suffer than to see his child suffer?<br>
Do you think that it did not cost God something to redeem this world? It cost God the most precious possession He ever had. When God gave His Son, He gave all, and yet He gave Him freely for you and me.</p>
<p>
But God commanded it, and Abraham surrendered his will to God’s will.</p>
<h3>
The Sacrifice
</h3>
<p>
Abraham bound Isaac's hands and feet, and laid him on the altar. Then he took the knife, and raised his hand to sacrifice Isaac.<br>
No sooner was his hand lifted when <dr class="alt5">“the Angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham, Abraham!”
and He said, “Do not lay your hand on the lad, or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.” (Gen 22:11-12)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Because Abraham obeyed God and held back not even his only child, God enlarged His promises once again:
<dr class="alt5">“Then the Angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time out of heaven, and said: “By Myself I have sworn, says the Lord, because you have done this thing, and have not withheld your son, your only son—  blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is on the seashore; and your descendants shall possess the gate of their enemies. In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have obeyed My voice.” (Gen 22:15-18)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
If you take my advice, you will have no will other than God’s will. Make a full and complete surrender, and the sweet messages of heaven will come to you. God will whisper into your soul <font size="+1">THE SECRETS OF HEAVEN.</font><br>
After Abraham did what God told him, God told His friend all about His Son.</p>
<p>
You remember that Christ said,<dr class="alt5"> “Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day, and he saw it and was glad.” (John 8:56)</dr class="alt5"> I have an idea that God then and there just lifted<font size="+1"> THE CURTAIN OF TIME</font> for Abraham. He looked down into the future, saw God’s Son coming up Calvary, bearing his sins and the sins of all posterity. God gave him that secret, and told him how His Son was to come into the world and take away his sins.</p>
<p> If we make a full surrender, God will give us something better than we have ever known before. We will get a new vision of Jesus Christ, and will thank God not only in this life but in the life to come.<br> May God help each and every one of us to make a full and complete and unconditional surrender to Him, fully and wholly, now and forever.</p>
