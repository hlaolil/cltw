   <h1>
Resurrection of the Dead<br> and Eternal Judgement
</h1>
<p><dr class="alt5">
Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ,
let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation
of repentance from dead works</font 

color="firebrick">, and of faith toward God, Of the doctrine of 

baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of <font color="firebrick">resurrection of the dead, 

and of eternal judgement.</font> (Heb 6:1-2)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
The principle doctrines of resurrection of the dead and eternal 

judgement are not just important, but related. Everyone, including you, 

will be resurrected from the dead and judged according to your works. 

And the outcome of this judgement will last for eternity!<br> What is decided 

about you at this judgement will be your fate forever!!!<dr class="alt5"><br> 

“For we must all appear before the judgement seat of Christ, that each 

one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has 

done, whether good or bad.” (2 Cor 5:10).</dr class="alt5"></p>
 <p>But if you are following Jesus Christ, you have no need to fear.</p>
<p><font color="red"> If you have 

rejected Christ, you should be very afraid indeed.</font color="red"></p>
<h2>
Two resurrections and two judgements
</h2>
<h3>
Resurrection of the believers
</h3>
<p>
There will be two separate resurrections and two separate judgements. The 

first resurrection will be of the believers in Christ. We will be judged 

according to our works for eternal rewards. The second resurrection, 

followed by what is known as the “Great White Throne Judgement” is only 

for all the unsaved, where they will be judged according to their works 

for punishment.<BR> They are separate, yet similar. In each case, the 

resurrection comes first, then the judgement soon after. The Christians 

will get a new spiritual body.<BR> Paul describes receiving this new 

body:</p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all 

be changed— in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last 

trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised 

incorruptible, and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must put on 

incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So when this 

corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on 

immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: 

“Death is swallowed up in victory.” O Hades, where is your victory?”<BR>
(1 Cor 15:51-55)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
These new bodies will be perfect. They will never be sick or hungry or 

in pain. Oh it will be glorious!!! Hallelujah! Praise to the Lamb!!!</p>
<p>
The first resurrection takes place after the Great Tribulation and 

before (or shortly into) the thousand-year reign of Christ on earth 

(Millennial Reign). Here judgement is given to the believers:</p>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">
And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgement was committed to 

them. Then I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their 

witness to Jesus and for the word of God, who had not worshipped the 

beast or his image, and had not received his mark on their foreheads or 

on their hands. And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand 

years. (Rev 20:4-5)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Every Christian’s work shall be judged to see what sort or quality it 

is. It will be tried by fire, and the poor quality ones will be burned 

up. For the works that remain, the believer will receive a reward. <BR>

Please note that salvation is not at stake here. If you are in the first 

resurrection, you are saved. But your eternal rewards <font 

size="+1">ARE</font> at stake. Poor quality works include not trusting 

God in every area of your life, using your spiritual gifts for material 

gain, keeping your gifts to yourself (see Parable of the Talents, Matt 

25:14-30), and refusing to give up a certain (minor) sin. The results of 

this judgement are eternal; what rewards you get (or don’t get) you will 

have for <font size="+1">ETERNITY</font>.</p>
<h3>
Resurrection of the unsaved
</h3>
<p>

Such is the case also in the resurrection of the unsaved. They will be 

resurrected from the dead after the Millennial Reign, and judged for 

their evil works. These are all on their way to the lake of fire, but 

this judgement determines the degree of punishment. A serial killer will 

have it worse off than a fornicator or thief.</p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
And I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and books were 

opened. And another book was opened, which is the Book of Life. And the 

dead were judged according to their works, by the things which were 

written in the books. The sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death 

and Hades delivered up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, 

each one according to his works. Then Death and Hades were cast into the 

lake of fire. This is the second death. And anyone not found written in 

the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire. (Rev 20:13-15)</dr 

class="alt5"></p>
<p>
These people will be resurrected out of hell, judged, and sent to the 

lake of fire. Since this second resurrection is <dr class="alt5">to the resurrection of condemnation <br>(John 

5:28-29)</dr class="alt5">,<br> <font size="+1">NO ONE</font> here will be found in the book 

of life, and thus all will end up in the lake of fire.</p>
<p>
Will the unsaved people get new bodies like the saved ones? I once was 

told that they might also get new bodies, ones that can withstand the 

torments of the lake of fire. This seems to make sense, but since I have 

no scriptural backing for it, I cannot say that it is true.</p>
<h3>
All will be Judged
</h3>
<p>
The resurrection from the dead is important, because it will affect you 

some day. You will be resurrected from the dead and judged, regardless 

to whether you are a Christian or not. If you are a Christian, you 

should be living for Christ in every area of your life, and not 

resisting Him in any. You need to be sold out totally for Christ. If you 

are not saved, you need to get saved so that you can take part in the 

first resurrection instead of the second.</p>
