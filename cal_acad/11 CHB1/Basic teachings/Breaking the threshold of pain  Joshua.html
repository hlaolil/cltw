   <h1>
Breaking the threshold of pain <br> Joshua
</h1>
<p>
Doors open and close. They offer exciting new opportunities and perhaps some significant (and often painful) challenges. Doors abound. They are all around us – beckoning us to new rooms of experience. Some doors come into focus through meeting new people, others are first clearly seen through the tear-filled eyes of loss. One Bible character found himself in the threshold of a new door facing a commission from the Most High through the tears of such a loss.</p>
<h3>
Serving and Learning 
</h3>
<p>
Joshua spent nearly forty years of his life serving behind the towering figure of Moses. Yet, the day finally came that God took the mantle of leadership off of the lifeless shoulders of the old chief, and placed it firmly on Joshua. The door opened to a new era of God’s people, and the lessons involved in this new direction were captured eternally in the Biblical record, in a book that bears Joshua’s name.</p>
<p>
The Church through the ages has primarily thought of the Book of Joshua as a historical record, but the ancient Jewish organisation of the Scriptures placed the book as part of the Prophets. The Prophets are divided into the Early Prophets and the Latter Prophets. <br>
Joshua was placed at the opening of the Early Prophets. The writing can easily divided into three sections:</p> 
<p>
Entering Canaan (Joshua 1-5); </p>
<p>
Conquering Canaan (Joshua 6-12);</p>
<p> 
Dividing Canaan (Joshua 13-24).</p>
<h3>
The Preparation Stages: Seven Critical Lessons
</h3>
<p>
Joshua 1 opens with the memory of a meeting between God and Joshua. The text relates:
<dr class="alt5">“After the death of Moses the servant of the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ assistant, saying: “Moses My servant is dead. Now therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, to the land which I am giving to them” (Josh 1:1-2)<dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Though God met with Joshua and spoke directly to him for the first time in the Scripture record, Joshua had a long road of preparation to get to that point. God did not simply clone Moses, but rather included in the record of His Word a slow and steady training of Joshua from military adviser to Chief of the Tribes, an office that had only one prior leader (Moses) and left tough sandals to fill! Serving Moses from about age 40, Joshua did not receive the mantle of leadership until about age 80, yet he no doubt seemed young compared to his mentor and predecessor (who was about 120 when he passed on)!</p>
<p>
The Bible writer took great pains to show the gradual formation of Joshua, as he was prepared by God to lead the people into the very critical operation of attaining the land God had promised to their fathers. Joshua was groomed for the job, and the Torah reveals that he had seven specific experiences that shaped his leadership style, his heart for God and his daily priorities. A closer look at these seven events of Joshua’s life can help us understand the preparation this choice servant of God experienced, but it can offer much more. Observing these shaping experiences can also help us understand how our Lord shapes those who He can use.</p>
<p>
Each experience was a stage in his training and included first three “external” leadership lessons:</p>
<p><font color="firebrick">
Stage One:</font> The Value of the Worn Knee – Learning the Power of Intercession (Ex. 17:9-16)</p>
<p><font color="firebrick">
Stage Two:</font> The Value of the Locked Arms – Learning the Mystery of Communion (Ex. 24)</p>
<p><font color="firebrick">
Stage Three:</font> The Value of the Trained Ear – Learning to Hear the Hearts of Men (Ex. 32)</p>
<p>
Following the lessons of these external leadership qualities, the training continued with three essential “internal” leadership processes:</p>
<p><font color="firebrick">
Stage Four:</font> The Value of a Thirsty Heart – Learning the Process of Worship Encounters (Ex. 33)</p>
<p><font color="firebrick">
Stage Five:</font> The Value of a Controlled Appetite – Learning to Overcome the Need for Recognition (Num. 11:26-29)</p>
<p><font color="firebrick">
Stage Six:</font>  The Value of Vision – Learning to See with the Eyes of Faith<br> (Num. 13:16; 14:6-10; 14:38)</p>
 <p>
The seventh and final preparation stage was the commissioning service itself, and the lessons that come with finally taking the leadership place. With all the preparation to that time, there was still a lesson to be gained at the diploma time.</p>
<p><font color="firebrick">
Stage Seven:</font> Learning to Receive a Commission <br>(Num. 27:12-23; 34:17; Deut. 1:38; 3:21; 31:3; 34:3)</p>
<p>
Without fanfare or special announcement, Joshua emerged into the scene of the Bible record, having broken through his threshold of pain after Moses' death, amidst a brewing conflict with the desert people called the Amalekites.</p>
