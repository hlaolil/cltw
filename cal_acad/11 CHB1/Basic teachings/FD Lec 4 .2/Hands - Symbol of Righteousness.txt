Hands - Symbol of Righteousness

<h3>
The righteous
</h3>
<p>
This remark by Job is sometimes used by some to teach that all the elect children of God will persevere in practical sanctification and a continuation of Gospel profession. But if this text is used in such a way, the candid hearer should notice that (if used to attempt to support such a position) it would quickly begin to prove more than the user intended! "The righteous shall hold on his way!" it is proclaimed. But let us consider the verse in that light for a moment. It does not say that the righteous shall return to his way. It does not say that the righteous shall falter from his way but later repent. It says that the righteous will hold on his way. If this text is to be considered to speak of practical sanctification or Gospel profession, then it would give grave doubt to the gracious state of most of those mentioned in the Bible, and all of us I fear.</p>
<h3>
Holding
</h3>
<p>
Did David "hold on his way?" When he sinned with Bathsheba and had her husband murdered â€“ was that "holding" on his way? No, that would quite surely be a falling from the good way. Did Solomon "hold on his way?" He spent a good deal of the latter years of his life engaging in idolatrous practices with his wives. That was not holding on his way. What about Lot, a man that the Scriptures specifically say was righteous? The last record of Lot shows him fathering his grandchildren in a drunken stupor. Did he "hold" on his way on that occasion?</p>
<p>
What about the reader, or the writer? I have no desire to publish my faults and failures in this format (or any other), but I can assure the reader that I have many times fallen aside from that which I should do. I have not held on my way. The honest reader will likely make the same confession. So, then, if this passage were to be used to teach this doctrine, it would prove far more than intended.</p>
<p>
I believe that God holds His children, and we are eternally safe in Him. Though we may fall by the wayside, or become shipwrecked as warned by Paul, our eternal destiny is still in Him and is secure. That being said, the knowledge that we can forsake our profession of faith or become shipwrecked should cause us to place great importance on doing commands of God. He may live there, and he may die there, but he will never be happy there, and the chastening hand of God will not be stilled.</p>

Now, to understand what this verse is teaching, we must first consider the context. Job has been surrounded by miserable friends, who have attempted to blame Job's troubles on some unconfessed sin of his. The more Job defended his conduct, the more they insisted on his guilt. In this chapter, Job bemoans the continued provocation of his miserable comforters, and their seeming hypocrisy, He then states in Job 17:8 of the effect the history of Job's experience will have on others who hear of it, such as us. <dr class="alt5">"Upright men are astonished at this, and the innocent stirs himself up against the hypocrite." (Job 17:8)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Now in Job 17:9, he speaks of the righteous holding on his way. Notice that this verse is often misquoted, and the word "also" is left out. This word "also" ties verse 9 in with verse 8. It seems plain to me that Job is continuing to speak of the effect his story would have on future generations, specifically others who were being troubled, mocked, or scorned when they were trying to do right. What effect will it have? It will encourage the man or woman who is trying to live a Godly, righteous life to "hold on his way," They will be emboldened to keep on doing what they believe to be right. The man who knows his innocence in the face of hypocritical accusers will feel a kinship with Job, and will be strengthened.</p>

Did Christ not give us similar encouragement? Matthew 10 states, <dr class="alt5">"A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master. It is enough for a disciple that he be like his teacher, and a servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more will they call those of his household!" (Matt 10:24-25)<dr class="alt5"> We have similar encouragements around us today. We also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses. So then, let us use the witness of Christ, Job, and saints we know from our experience to give us courage to hold on our way, and strengthen our grip on the plough of service. Let us bow our backs to the load, and strive to live in better obedience to our Lord and Master/p.
