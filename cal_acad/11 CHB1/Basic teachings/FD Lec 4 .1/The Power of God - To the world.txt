And these signs will follow those who believe: In My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; (Mark 16:17)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Some people have tried to get around these verses by saying that they were not found in some of the oldest manuscripts. The only reason that people desire to explain these scriptures away is because their lives don't match up with them. Instead of changing themselves, they would rather change the scriptures.</p>
<p>
We still have the same authority today that Jesus gave His disciples to cast out devils. Speaking in tongues is still a supernatural gift to every believer who will receive it. We are still supposed to walk in victory over the devil, and if a true believer lays hands on the sick, they will recover. <dr class="alt5">"Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever" (Heb 13:8)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
When Jesus said that we would do these signs in His name, He was referring to doing these signs through His power and ability. He gave us His power of attorney.</p>
<p>
Casting out devils is not a special ministry for only some in the body of Christ. It is the right of every believer. No one who reads the Bible can deny that Jesus and the disciples cast demons out of people. Still some don't believe that this has any relevance to us today. All they have to do is look around at the depravity in our society, and they can see that we still have demon possession today.</p>
<p>
Speaking in tongues is a gift of the Holy Spirit discussed in 1Cor 12-14. It is one of the first miraculous manifestations that accompanies receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost (Acts 2:4, 10:46, and 19:6).</p>
<p>
There are two different kinds of speaking in tongues. 1Cor 13:1 says we can speak with the tongues of man or of angels. The tongues of men is speaking of known languages such as what took place on the Day of Pentecost (Acts 2:4-6). This is the gift to supernaturally speak a known language without having been taught it, and it comes for the purpose of witnessing, as on the Day of Pentecost. There is also a gift of tongues that is speaking in a heavenly language (what 1Cor 13:1 calls the tongues of angels). This is a language that is not known to the speaker (1Cor 14:2 and 14) but allows the believer to communicate directly with the Lord through the Spirit. There is another kind of speaking in tongues that equals prophecy if it is interpreted (1Cor 14:5).</p>
<p>
Not every believer will speak in known languages, as on the Day of Pentecost, or prophesy in the assembly through a message in tongues and an interpretation (1Cor 12:30), but every believer who receives the baptism of the Holy Ghost can speak in the tongues that are for the purpose of edification (1Cor 14:4).</p>

they will take up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it will by no means hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover.‚Äù (Mark 16:18)<dr class="alt5"> </p>
<p>
This is either speaking literally of supernatural protection if we pick up a snake or symbolically of protection in our fight against the devil. Since the other four signs in this list are literal, it is most probable that this is speaking of physically taking up snakes.</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul experienced this supernatural protection from a viper when he was shipwrecked on the island of Melita (Acts 28:3-5). However, this is the only recorded example of this in the New Testament. There is no record of the disciples picking up snakes just to prove they were believers. That would be tempting God (Luke 4:9-12). This, as well as drinking any deadly thing, is a promise that if we pick up snakes accidentally or are forced into that position because of our stand for Christ, we can believe for supernatural protection.</p>
<p>
This does not mean that we can tempt God by drinking poison just to see if this promise works.</p>
<p>
Jesus gave all believers (not just ministers) the power to heal the sick through the laying on of hands. Since it is His power that we are using and not our own, we should expect to get the same results.</p>
<p>
The laying on of hands is an important doctrine in the New Testament (Heb 6:2). We can actually transmit the power of God through laying our hands on people in the same way that power can be transferred from one battery to another through cables. This doesn't work for everyone though, only for those who believe</p>
