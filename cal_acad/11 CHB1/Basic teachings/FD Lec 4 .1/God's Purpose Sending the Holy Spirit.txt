God's Purpose Sending the Holy Spirit

<p>
<dr class="alt5">Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgements and His ways past finding out!
“For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has become His counsellor? “Or who has first given to Him and it shall be repaid to him?” For of Him and through Him and to Him are all things, to whom be glory forever. Amen. (Rom 11:33-36)</dr class="alt5">
<h3>
Why Did God Send The Holy Spirit?
</h3>
<p>
The Holy Spirit came to glorify Christ and to lead believers into all truth. On the eve of His crucifixion while still in the Upper Room, the Lord Jesus said to the disciples, <dr class="alt5">"the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you." (John 14:26)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
The Holy Spirit came to enable you to know Christ through a new birth and to give you the power to live and share the abundant life which Jesus promised to all who trust and obey Him.</p>
<p>
The Holy Spirit inspired holy men of old to write the Scriptures. As you read the Bible, He reveals its truth to you. You read passages of Scripture that you have read many times before, and suddenly, at the moment you need a particular truth, a certain passage comes alive to you. Why? Because the Holy Spirit makes the Word of God relevant and meaningful when you need it. It is a living Book inspired by the Spirit, and only Christians who are filled with the Spirit can understand the true meaning of God's Word.</p>
<p>
You pray and, except for the prayer of confession, you cannot expect God to answer your prayer unless you are walking in the Spirit. You witness, and no one responds unless you are controlled and empowered by the Spirit.
One cannot live a holy life apart from the help of the Holy Spirit for, "the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness." (Gal 5:22)</p>
<p>
A minister friend said to me, "I don't like all of this talk about the Holy Spirit. I want to talk about Jesus Christ." I reminded him that that was the reason the Holy Spirit came -- to exalt and glorify Christ.</p>
<p>
It is impossible to even know Christ apart from the regenerating ministry of the Spirit. It was Jesus of Nazareth, Himself, who said,<dr class="alt5"> "Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God." (John 3:5)</dr class="alt5"> It is impossible for you to become a Christian, to understand the Bible and other spiritual truths, to pray, to live a holy life, to witness or do anything for the Lord Jesus apart from the person of the Holy Spirit of God.</p>
