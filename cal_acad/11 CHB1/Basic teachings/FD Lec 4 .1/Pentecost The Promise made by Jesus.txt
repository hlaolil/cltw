<h1>
Pentecost The Promise made by Jesus
</h1>
<h3>
Holy Spirit baptism
</h3>
<p>
It was fitting that on the eve of His ascension Jesus should announce, <dr class="alt5">"... you shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.” (Acts 1:5)</dr class="alt5">. He said further, <dr class="alt5">"You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you" (Acts 1:8)</dr class="alt5">. This was in accord with the Baptist's prediction made at the beginning of Jesus' ministry (Matt 3:11; Mark 1:8; Luke 3:16). That the coming upon them of the Holy Spirit should be called a baptism deserves notice. Perhaps we should gain the idea that, as literal wind coming upon one completely envelops one, so the Spirit coming upon one takes hold of his entire being. Water baptism was instituted to serve as a symbol of Holy Spirit baptism.</p>
<h3>
Filled with the Holy Spirit
</h3>
<p>
Coming then to the Pentecost outpouring of the Spirit, we should note the following. Foremost is the fact that all those present were filled with the Holy Spirit. Since the coming of the Spirit was described as a pouring, the receiving of the Spirit was a being filled with the Spirit. Their experience was quite identical with Christ's. This fact furnishes a tremendous incentive for the study of the manner in which the Spirit empowered Christ for performing His prophetic, priestly, and kingly work. As He went forth in the "power of the Spirit," so we may in like manner go forth. This experience, coming to those who were already Christ's disciples, marks the transition from the Old Testament saints' spiritual privileges to those under the new covenant. These disciples were saved before Pentecost and had experienced Holy Spirit blessings in the same manner as other old covenant saints. What is more, they had enjoyed the Anointed-with-the-Holy-Spirit Jesus. In accordance with Joel's prediction they now received the larger blessing of baptism with the Holy Spirit. This being the time of transition from the old privileges to the new excludes the idea that this experience is the norm or pattern of Christian experience. That is, Pentecost did not establish an order of sequence in the respective experiences of conversion and of receiving the baptism with the Holy Spirit.
<h3>
Peter's Sermon
</h3>
<p>
Peter's words in Acts 2 come nearer to furnishing this order of sequence. The unbelieving Jews who heard Peter's sermon <dr class="alt5">"were cut to the heart." (Acts 2:37 )</dr class="alt5"> <dr class="alt5">"Peter said to them, “Repent, and let every one of you be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call.” (Acts 2:38-39)</dr class="alt5">. Here we see preaching which brought conviction of sin. The remedy was repentance and baptism "in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins." When these conditions were fulfilled, Peter said, "You shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit." In view of the setting of these words, this receiving of the Holy Spirit could be none other than baptism with the Holy Spirit, identical in nature with what the apostles and the company with them had just experienced.</p>
<p>
The sequence: repentance, faith, baptism of the Holy Spirit. This is the norm of Christian experience. The second fact deserving notice is that of the supernatural manifestations attending Pentecost. The physical aspects such as the sound "from heaven like the rush of a mighty wind," the appearance to them of "tongues as of fire," and the speaking "in other tongues," were all sensory evidences which confirmed the miracle of their being filled with the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>
In the case of Pentecost all the historical evidences which prove Luke to have been an accurate and trustworthy historian support the historicity of Pentecost. We are free to interpret the event accordingly. Peter's interpretation is presumably the most accurate because he was there and experienced it.</p>
<p>
According to Peter the manifestation of the supernatural was to give adequate outward attestation to the internal experience of being baptised with the Holy Spirit. God provided physical phenomena as outward evidence for believing in the internal spiritual experience which lay beyond sense perception.</p>
<p>
We should study Peter's interpretation of this event. He testified that the things which happened on that day fulfilled Joel's prophecy. The last days had come. The pouring out of the Holy Spirit was proof of this. The gift of prophecy was no longer limited, as in the Old Testament times, to certain prophets, priests, or kings. Through the outpouring of the Spirit, prophecy was found among young men and women, as well as among the old. It reached beyond official servants to all God's people. More wonderful still, <dr class="alt5">"Whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved" (Acts 2:21)</dr class="alt5">. All-irrespective of age, rank, and race-should be baptised with the Spirit. This coming of the Spirit was the fulfilment of God's promise to Christ and was the first work of the reigning Lord. The baptism with the Spirit is positive proof that Jesus is both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:33-36)
