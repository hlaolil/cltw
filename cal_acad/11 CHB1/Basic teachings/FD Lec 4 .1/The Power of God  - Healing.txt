<dr class="alt5">God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him (Acts 10:38)</dr class="alt5">. 
So first of all healing is good. And second sickness is of the devil not God. God anointed Jesus for the purpose of healing <dr class="alt5">"The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me ..."(Luke 4:18)</dr class="alt5">. Notice Jesus was teaching one day and it says,<dr class="alt5"> "The power of the Lord was present to heal them" (Luke 5:17)</dr class="alt5">. So God uses His power to heal not to make sick. And notice people sought to touch Him, people came to Him to lay His hands on them, they ran and got all the sick and laid them in the streets so that they could touch His garment, they decided they were going to receive their healing not God. That's why God supplied the power for their healing. They sought Him so that let's me know that it's not about if it's God's will, but their decision to go and receive. Have you noticed that Jesus never prayed for God to heal someone. He never told His disciples to pray to God to heal someone, He said you heal them. They didn't have to pray to God for Him to heal someone because they already knew His will and He already supplied His power. Notice Jesus told His disciples to pray, <dr class="alt5">"Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven."</dr class="alt5"> Are there any sick in heaven, no, so God doesn't want any sick on the earth.</p>

The blood of Jesus purchased your healing. Just as God wants everyone saved, He wants everyone healed they are both by the same blood. Can you imagine taking someone out to a buffet and paying for them to eat and then not wanting them to eat. And yet, that's how some people view God. He sent His only begotten Son to purchase your healing with His blood, so why would He not want you healed (2Peter 2:24). Healing has to be received. Notice Jesus didn't just go to people they came to Him to receive healing. Jesus was full of grace and truth and people came to Him to receive grace from Him. And that power is present today. That's why Jesus said it was good that He go away so that the Comforter would be sent. Now that power is present everywhere at all times. And God does not change, the power was present to heal then and it is present to heal now.</P>
