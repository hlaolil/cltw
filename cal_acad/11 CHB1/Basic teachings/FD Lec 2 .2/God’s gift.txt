<h3>
Salvation
</h3>
<p>
The context surrounding Ephesians 2:8 is all about salvation; absent is any explicit mention of saving faith as part of God’s gift nor whether faith is the response to salvation. If faith was a divine gift, it would have a seeming contradiction to Paul’s earlier statements such as, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved" (Acts 16:31) or "So faith comes from hearing and hearing by the word of Christ" (Rom 10:17).</p>
<p>
Aside from the interpretive possibility of Ephesians 2:8, there seems scant biblical evidence that "faith" is a gift from God. When Paul holds up Abraham as an example of faith, he esteems Abraham’s personal and self generated faith. In another example where Jesus is conversing with Martha (John 11:25-27), Martha demonstrates a self generated belief of something that was true (Jesus as the Messiah).</p>
<p>
The Bible clearly exhorts human beings to believe with the imperative "believe in": Mark 1:15; John 1:12; 3:18; 10:38; 12:36; 20:31; Acts 16:31; Romans 10:9; Galatians 2:16; 1 Thessalonians 4:14; etc.</p>
<h3>
Faith
</h3>
<p>
The Bible appears to indicate that faith is the responsibility of the hearer: John 5:46; Luke 24:25; Acts 26:27; etc.

So if saving faith was the gift of God, a contradiction exists. Wouldn’t the divine gift of faith absolve anyone of responsibility for it?

The Bible makes a distinction between faith and works; faith (the act of believing something is factually true with trust) is not considered work.</p>
<h3>
Works
</h3>
<p>
Works cannot result in saving faith: Acts 13:38-39; Romans 3:21-22, 28; Galatians 2:15-16; 3:1-9.

Genuine faith results in works: James 2:14-26.</p>
<h3>
Faith precedes Salvation
</h3>
<p>
The biblical evidence explicitly indicates that faith precedes salvation (John 5:24; Rom 3:21-26; Gal 3:1-5) and is not simultaneous nor a response to it. Works is implied in the phrase "and not of yourselves" (Eph 2:8); however, it is not likely that faith is included with human efforts of good deeds or compliance to Mosaic legislation.</p>
<p>
The interpretive controversy of Ephesians 2:8 reflects the tension between God’s sovereignty / omniscience and human will / responsibility. God’s own Son, Jesus Christ, was the divine gift that was provided for the sin offering to pay the judicial price of mankind’s past, present and future sin. The fact that faith is a personal response on the part of people must be balanced with the fact that God is sovereign. The Bible clearly teaches that God convicts men of their need for salvation:

Peter said to them, "Repent, and each of you be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:38).</p>
