<h1>
God is my Rewarder
</h1>
<p>
Receiving a reward is wonderful.  It is a recognition of 
something attained or accomplished.  What is even 
more significant is the source of the reward.
Can you imagine what it is like to receive a reward from 
the Creator of all things!  That is precisely what 
happens for those who seek him.  Hebrews 11:6 tells us 
that just to seek God results in a reward from God 
Himself.
Seeking God must be a very special task for God to 
present a reward.</p>
<h3>
Seeking God
</h3>
In Hebrews 11, we read about the heroes of faith.  
These "spiritual giants" placed their faith in the One 
who transcends every situation.  No matter what 
happened, they were looking for the One who is above 
all.  Some may be tempted to seek God because of 
some type of trophy.  In doing so, they would be 
short-sighted.  No matter how great the reward given, 
nothing can compare to God Himself.  He is the One who 
spoke a billion times a billion worlds into existence, 
knows the thought of all six billion plus inhabitants of 
the earth, and is not subject to time or space.  Seek 
God?  We would be foolish not to seek Him.
God said to Abraham that He (God) was his (Abraham's) 
reward.  (Gen 15:1)  Surely Abraham could have 
considered becoming the father of many nations a prize 
but God said otherwise.
Who needs rewards when you have God?  A trophy 
vaporises like steam when compared to God himself.</p>
<h3>
The Rewarder and the Reward
</h3>
<p>
So, God is the rewarder but He is also the reward for 
those who seek Him.  The way we seek Him is through 
faith and belief "That He is" - in all areas of life.  The 
question we ask is "Where is God"?  Hebrews 11 says 
that Abraham looked for God when asked to sacrifice 
Isaac and found a God who was <dr class="alt5">"able to raise him up
even from the dead". (Heb 11:19)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
When reading and studying scripture, we also seek God 
by looking for Him on every page.  "What does 
scripture say about God?" is the most valuable question 
every time we pick up the Bible.</p>
<p>
Have you looked at the vastness of the sky above?  
Worship pours out from God's creation.  This is seeking 
God through the created.  Sometimes I will notice 
brilliant colours and begin to worship God for what He 
created.  When blessings surprise us, we worship the 
God of all love.  And, in difficult times, just like those in 
Hebrews 11, we worship God in faith. In these ways, we 
recognise God.  This is seeking Him in all areas of life.</p>
<p>
I don't know about you, but my joy is seeking God, both 
my rewarder and my reward.  Any other prize is bonus. </p>
