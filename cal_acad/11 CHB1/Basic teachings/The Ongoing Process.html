  <h1>
The Ongoing Process
</h1>
<p>The ongoing process after Salvation is being Reborn, Renewed and Resurrected.</p> 
<h4>
Reborn
</h4>
<p>
Believing His Word, repenting of sin, confessing that Jesus is the resurrected Messiah, and inviting and receiving God’s Holy Spirit into our hearts mark the actual birth of our new spiritual being. Those who have received Christ as Saviour and Lord have been born again. In reality, they have become new creatures through God.</p>
<p>
To enter the spiritual kingdom of God today and to prepare for entry into His eternal kingdom someday, people must be born again now — in this life! It remains for us to believe and to let God do His work of transformation in us as we repent, are converted, and walk in a new life. The time to be born again is now!</p>
<h3>
How Are We Born Again?
</h3>
<p>
We must affirm the essentially spiritual dynamic of the new birth. As such, we should avoid summarising it in terms that approximate a mathematical formula: You do this, and God does that.</p>
<p>
On the other hand, the Bible informs us consistently about elements that are common in most or all people who have experienced spiritual regeneration:</p>
<h3>
Faith  
</h3>
<p>
Simply believing the word of the gospel when we hear it. If we hear the good news about Jesus but fail to believe, we will not be transformed. We won’t be born again without believing in the Son of God.
<br>Faith in Jesus is the foundational doctrine of Christianity (Heb 11:1,6).</p>
<h3>
Repentance  
</h3>
<p>
Simply turning away from our sins and toward the Saviour who forgives and delivers us from them. A deeply personal experience, repentance arises out of the conviction of our guilt in disobeying God and the awareness of how our sins constantly distance us from Him (Mark 1:15; Luke 13:3, 5).</p>
<h3>
Baptism 
</h3>
<p>
The symbolic ordinance that demonstrates our faith and repentance (Acts 2:38). Baptism in water represents burial of the dying, sinful nature and resurrection to new life, born again with a new nature. It is a statement to others that we now belong to God, have committed ourselves to a new way of life, and are new creatures — i.e., that we have been born again (Rom 6:3-7).</p>
<h3>
Receiving the Holy Spirit 
</h3>
<p>
Upon faith and repentance, Christians are promised they will be filled by God’s Holy Spirit, enabling them to obey the Word, follow Christ as Lord, and overcome the world (John 14, 15, 16). God’s Spirit inspires the newborn to godly attitudes, motivations, directions, purposes, and goals. With full commitment to Christ as Lord, Christians can confidently fulfil their spiritual responsibilities. In receiving and obeying God’s Spirit, we offer full confirmation to the reality of our new birth.</p>
<h3>
Summary outline of our subject
</h3>
<p>
<font size="+1">WHAT</font> is the new birth? It is the great life-change in one who was once an unbelieving, unconverted sinner, but is now a true child of God.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">WHEN</font> is the new birth? It happens when a person turns away from sin to trust in the Lord Jesus Christ and receives the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">WHERE</font> is the new birth? It takes place on the inside — a new spirit and heart on which God writes His ways and laws. Inward change, of course, will inevitably be seen in outward behaviour changes and obedience toward God.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">HOW</font> does the new birth take place? It happens only by the gracious, regenerative power of God’s Spirit. Still, it is closely related to the human responses of hearing and believing the Word, turning from sin, and baptism.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">WHY</font> does God give the new birth? Because the old life is sinful; the old heart is wicked, stony, and cold; and the old nature is destined for death. He renews us so we may experience a new life, new heart, and new identity — in Christ.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">WHO</font> experiences the new birth? Whomever God chooses to rescue by His mercy and transform by His grace. Whosoever will may come and be reborn!</p>
<h4>
Renewed
</h4>
<h3>
No more sin
</h3>
<p>
 <dr class="alt5">that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin (Romans 6:6</dr class="alt5">)</p>
<p>
Our sin nature is dead and gone, but it left behind a body. That body is the carnal mind. It will still function as programmed until we reprogram it.<br>
<dr class="alt5">And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God (Rom. 12:2).</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Therefore, victory in the Christian life is as simple as renewing our minds to who we are and what we have already received in Christ. It’s not the struggle of two natures inside of us; we are the way we think (Prov 23:7). If we see ourselves as old sinners, saved by grace, then we will continue to struggle with sin. But when we see the total change that took place in our nature, we will manifest that change in our actions.</p>
<p>
When we see ourselves as being part devil, we act like it. But when we see who we are in Christ—i.e., in our born-again spirits—we become like Him <br>(2 Cor 3:18 and 1 John 3:2).<br> The way we see ourselves becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<h3>
Revelation
</h3>
<p>
This is the dominant revelation the Lord has used to change my life. But it’s the revelation I received from the Word on who I have become in my spirit that has made the biggest impression and lasting change in my life. It has totally changed my identity.</p>
<p>
I call this revelation Spirit, Soul and Body. That’s not a catchy phrase, but it’s descriptive of the way the Lord revealed these truths to me. I’ve come to know I’m a spirit being who has a soul and lives in a body. But the real me is my spiritual person. And it’s in the spirit that I’ve been totally changed and made just like Jesus.</p>
<p>
Since God is a Spirit and He deals with me on the basis of who I am in the spirit (John 4:24), this has changed everything. I now worship God based on who I am in the spirit and not on who I am in my flesh; i.e., how I act or feel. I now understand how our holy God can truly love me, because in my born-again spirit, I’m totally righteous and holy (Eph 4:24). My spirit is His workmanship (Eph 2:10).</p>
<p>
I’ve discovered that I’m redeemed from the Law because the Law wasn’t made for a righteous man (1 Tim 1:9). The Law was given to show us our need for salvation, but it couldn’t save us (Rom. 3:19-21). But what the Law couldn’t do, Jesus did (Rom. 8:3-4), and I’m now the righteousness of God in Christ<br> (2 Cor. 5:21) </p>

<h4>
Resurrection
</h4>
<h3>
Death--Temporary Separation 
of the Spiritual from the Physical
</h3>
<p>
This temporary suspension of the activities of the body does not mean that the spirit of man is asleep. The body is but the tabernacle or dwelling place of the spirit part of man.<br> Upon the death of the body, the spirit of a believer takes it's departure, closing the senses of the body until the day of its resurrection. <br>Immediately upon the death of our bodies, we leave the flesh, <dr class="alt5">“to depart, and be with Christ” (Phil 1:23)</dr class="alt5">, <dr class="alt5">“eagerly waiting for the adoption, the redemption of our body” (Rom 8:23).</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
This is a picture of the death of the believer. He moves out of the body until it has been repaired and renovated, then, at the resurrection, the inward man will move back into his renewed body.</p>
<h3>
Raised to be Like Jesus
</h3>
<p>
Death is not to be feared by the Christian. We shall live in a literal body just as real as the one we have now, for, says Paul: <dr class="alt5">“... we also eagerly wait for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform our lowly body that it may be conformed to His glorious body,” (Phil 3:20-21).</dr class="alt5"> <br>The coming of our Lord in the air to take us to Heaven will necessitate a change in this purchased body of corruption. The body is as much the Lord’s purchased possession as is the soul. It is dear to Him. <dr class="alt5">“The body is ... for the Lord; and the Lord for the body” (1 Cor 6:13).</dr class="alt5"> <br>The goal of the Gospel is to bring eternal life and immortality to all who will believe. Since the body of the saints will be <dr class="alt5">“conformed to His glorious body,”</dr class="alt5"> we may well wonder what our bodies will be like at the resurrection. John says: <dr class="alt5">“we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is.” (1 John 3:2).</dr class="alt5"><br>When our Lord ascended into Heaven, He was thirty-three years of age, a young man in the strength and glory of His youth. Senility had not overtaken our Lord when He died upon the Cross for our sins. In David’s Psalm of the exalted Christ in the glory, we read: <dr class="alt5">“You have the dew of Your youth.”(Psa 110:3).</dr class="alt5">  What a wonderful thought! We shall be clothed with perennial youth. We shall be like Him, fashioned like His glorious body.</p>
<h3>
Transforming our body
</h3>
<p>
Christ shall <dr class="alt5">“transform our lowly body” (Phil 3:21)</dr class="alt5"> we read. The word “transform” means to transfigure. It has been suggested that we have here the thought of metamorphosis which is a remarkable change in the form and structure of a living body. When our Lord took Peter, James, and John up into the Holy Mountain, we read that <dr class="alt5">“He was transfigured before them” (Matt 17:2).</dr class="alt5"> Christ appeared during that brief period of time in His glorified body. He was transfigured (or metamorphosed) before them. It was a body like His post-resurrection body when He appeared to His disciples behind shut doors (John 20:19). The change of the believer at the resurrection has to do with his body, wherein resides the sin principle, for even the Christian must admit, <dr class="alt5">“For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good dwells;” (Rom 7:18).</dr class="alt5"> The word “change” could not refer to the spiritual part of man, for, as Kenneth Wuest says: “The word change is the translation of a Greek word which speaks of an expression which is assumed from the outside, which act brings about a change of outward expression.”</p>
<h3>
Metamorphosis
</h3>
<p>
Biologically speaking, the change of a caterpillar into a butterfly is spoken of as a “metamorphosis.” The ugly, repulsive caterpillar is confined to a tomb which it spins for itself. While in the cocoon there is an apparently dead and formless substance. But after the warm sun of spring has beaten its golden rays upon that cocoon, there comes forth a beautiful butterfly. Though the butterfly is different in appearance from the caterpillar, we recognise the beautiful winged insect as being the same as the caterpillar. It is the same living creature, yet different. So also is the resurrection of the body. Now we have a vile body (or a body of humiliation). The Apostle James calls it a “low” body, <dr class="alt5">“because as a flower of the field he will pass away” (James 1:10).</dr class="alt5"> The body of Adam, in its original state, was provided with a covering of glory, but when sin entered the covering of glory was replaced with a covering of humiliation. In our present bodies of humiliation we are unfit for the glories of Heaven and God’s presence, but hopefully we look for our Lord’s return when He shall fashion our bodies of humiliation like unto His own body of glory. It will be the same body in that it will be recognisable, but wonderfully changed.</p>
