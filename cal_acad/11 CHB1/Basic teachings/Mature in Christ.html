   <h1>
   Mature in Christ
</h1>
<p><dr class="alt5">
For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the basic principles of the oracles of God. You need milk, not solid food, for everyone who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, since he is a child. But solid food is for the mature, for those who have their powers of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil. Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and <font size="+1">GO ON TO MATURITY,</font> not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, and of instruction about washings, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgement. And this we will do if God permits.
(Heb 5:12-6:3)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
We should see our calling as not only that of worship leaders, but rather as worship disciplers.  In fact, I think the call of every believer is to make disciples, but it’s a hard road for many because we don’t understand what we’re working towards. </p>
<h3>
Given responsibility 
</h3>
<p>
There is a time by which a believer is no longer in need of discipleship, but should be given responsibility to disciple others – a time where he or she is no longer a student, but a teacher. This does not mean we/they stop learning, just as an adult does not stop eating food when he or she is no longer a child. If any of us stopped eating we would die, but an adult does – under normal circumstances – no longer need to be spoon fed like a child. He is equipped to feed himself.<br> Biblically, we should each grow up to feed ourselves – to <dr class="alt5">“rightly dividing the word of truth” (2 Tim 2:15)</dr class="alt5">.<br> 
This doesn’t mean we’re encouraged to separate ourselves from fellowship with other believers <dr class="alt5">"not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together"(Heb 10:25)</dr class="alt5"> but only that there is a point at which we should no longer need the spiritual attention of a newborn – when we should then be giving, rather than merely receiving. We need to seek Biblical relationships which can encourage this growth to happen – to put ourselves in situations and environments where we can become self-feeders.</p>
<h3>
The mature believer 
</h3>
<p>
Since the one still needing milk is “unskilled in the word of righteousness”, the mature believer should be the opposite. What does it mean to be “skilled in the word”? As 2 Tim 2 says, <dr class="alt5">“Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.” <br>(2 Tim 2:15)</dr class="alt5"><br> 
To “rightly handle” the word is to be “skilled in the word”: treating God’s revealed Word with reverence, and respect, and interpreting and applying to one’s life (AND the life of others) with care and even fear, given how important it is to apply and understand them correctly (see 2 Peter 3:16).<br> One does this by knowing and understanding the Word in context – historical and literary – so we truly understand what the original authors, inspired by the Holy Spirit, intended to say. In big words, we call this “exegesis” – in day to day language it simply means, we should be willing to understand what God is actually saying in His Word, and careful not to read our own ideas into it. As we mature in Christ, this should become more and more natural to us.</p>
<h3>
The mature practice discernment. 
</h3>
<p>
Notice; they don’t merely <font size="+1">HAVE</font> it – they put it into practice, and this discernment is sharpened by being continually put to good use. The discernment spoken of here is no spiritual gift, but simply something every mature believer, by encountering and knowing and growing up into Christ-likeness, should have. And what does discernment in practice look like? Godly wisdom – nothing less. What is Godly wisdom? Applying the truth that we discover by “rightly handling the Word”.

It’s easy to let other’s consciences guide us, as seems to be the practice for far too many Evangelical Christians, which results in us, when trying to be ‘Biblical’ on secondary matters, teaching as truth – as law – things that the Scriptures are not actually clear on. Though many think they’re doing other believers a service, too often this acts as an adding to the Gospel, and usually results in ultimately enslaving genuine believers to the law – emphasising law over grace, a grave error for believers, which ultimately leads to death, rather than eternal life.

We each need to approach the Word to discern for ourselves how God wants us to apply His Word, and be careful to not bind other believer’s by our own consciences on secondary matters. As each of us matures, we will discern how God is leading.</p>
<h3>
Stumbling blocks
</h3>
<p>
Lastly, from this passage, the mature should be beyond the following: </p>
<p>
<font color="firebrick">Dead works</font> (trying to earn one’s salvation through works rather than by faith).</p>
<p> 
<font color="firebrick">Instruction about washings </font>(the mature should already be baptised and have a clear understanding of the nature of baptism, both physical and spiritual).</p>
<p>
<font color="firebrick">Laying on of hands</font> (the mature should understand the transference of gifts and authority within the church).</p>
<p>
<font color="firebrick">Resurrection</font> (Jesus was raised bodily, and we will be too), and</p>
<p> 
<font color="firebrick">Eternal life.</font></p>
<p> 
Basically, these should no longer be stumbling blocks or issues for the mature – they should be beyond these five issues, and if they are not, they should be addressed now, so they may move on to more important matters of discipling and laying these foundational truths and practices in other’s lives. <br>We should, as believers seeking to grow up in Christ, solidify what we believe on these matters – seeking the Scriptures, and Godly counsel – in order to move beyond these basics, so we don’t feel the need to continually debate or discuss them again.</p>
<p><p class='block'><font color="sienna">
These are simple teachings – things that are foundational to the Christian life, according the Bible.</font></p>
