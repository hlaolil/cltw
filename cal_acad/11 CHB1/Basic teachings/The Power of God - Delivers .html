The Power of God - Delivers 
</h1>
<h3>
God Delivers
</h3>
<p>
Jesus says in Matthew 12:<dr class="alt5"> “But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, surely the kingdom of God has come upon you.” (Matt 12:28)</dr class="alt5"><br> Because of Jesus’ miraculous works, those who saw Him knew that the God of Israel was once again acting in their midst.</p>
<p>
Jesus’ miracles in particular were never magic tricks, designed only to impress and coerce. Instead, He used miraculous power to heal the sick, feed the hungry, and raise the dead. Why? We modern people think of miracles as the suspension of the natural order, but Jesus meant them to be the restoration of the natural order.</p>
<p>
Jesus’ miracles reveal His divine identity—an identity that calls for worship. This is the response of the disciples after Jesus walks on the water:<br> <dr class="alt5">“Truly You are the Son of God” (Matt 14:33)</dr class="alt5">. <br>When asked <dr class="alt5">"Are You the Coming One” (Luke 7:19)</dr class="alt5"> Jesus, instead of answering with a word testifying that He is the Messiah, points to His miracles.<br> Luke’s portrayal of Jesus is focused on His authority and the promise he brings. Jesus’ saving work inaugurates the kingdom of God, delivers sinners, secures forgiveness of sin, and provides the Spirit.</p>
<p>
In the Old Testament, miracles seemed to occur primarily in connection with one prominent leader at a time, such as Moses or Elijah or Elisha.<br> In the New Testament, there is a sudden and unprecedented increase in the miracles when Jesus begins His ministry (Luke 4:36–37, 40–41). <br>However, contrary to the pattern of the Old Testament, the authority to work miracles and to cast out demons was not confined to Jesus himself, nor did miracles die out when Jesus returned to heaven.<br> Even during His ministry, Jesus gave authority to heal the sick and to cast out demons not only to the Twelve, but also to seventy of His disciples <br>(Luke 10:1,9,17–19; cf. Matt 10:8; Luke 9:49–50).</p>
<p>
The miracles of the early church, then, served an immediately relevant purpose in redemptive history: verifying the authenticity of God’s revelation and signalling the coming of the new eschatological age among God’s people.</p>
<p>
Consider the Jerusalem Council in Acts 15. One of the largest disputes in the early church concerned whether or not Gentile converts to Christianity had to keep the Old Testament law and be circumcised.<br> It became such a matter of dispute that Paul, Peter, and Barnabas met with the leaders of the Jewish Christians in Jerusalem to debate the issue.<br> It's noteworthy that, as Acts 15 says, <dr class="alt5">“all the assembly fell silent, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles.” (Acts 15:12)</dr class="alt5"><br>Here the miraculous works of God served as evidence to the Jewish Christians that God was in fact working in a new and unique way among the Gentiles as well.</p>
