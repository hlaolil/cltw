   <h1>
The Helmet of Salvation
</h1>
<p>
When Paul wrote to the Ephesians about the Helmet of Salvation, some of them may have found the analogy to be a familiar one.<br> In the book of Isaiah, a description of God shows Him as having put on both the breastplate of righteousness and the helmet of salvation (Isaiah 59:17). <br>In referencing this Old Testament scripture, Paul drives home the point that it is in every sense of the word the armour of God—the same armour He Himself wears.<br> But it also leads us to consider what salvation is, what it has to do with a helmet and what it means for us.</p>
<h3>
What purpose does the helmet serve? 
</h3>
<p>
The Roman helmet, like helmets today, protected the head from the attacks of the enemy. The Helmet of Salvation is needed protect our minds in order to fend off spiritual attacks by the devil. </p> 
<h3>
What is salvation?
</h3>
<p>
Salvation basically means to be saved or delivered from something <br>(see examples in Exodus 14:13 and Micah 7:6-8). <br>In the New Testament, as we will see, it is generally used to refer to deliverance from the eternal death penalty of sin and deliverance into God's Kingdom.</p>
