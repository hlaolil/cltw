   <h1>
Drinking Milk and Eating Meat 
</h1>
<p>
When it has spiritual significance, milk in the Bible, identifies with the basic principles of Bible study. Milk spiritually signifies the nourishment we get from the Word of God. <dr class="alt5"> "as newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby" (1 Peter 2:2)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
Spiritual Immaturity 
</h3>
<p>
Specifically, the milk identifies with the first principles of Bible study. 
<dr class="alt5"><br>For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the first principles of the oracles of God; and you have come to need milk and not solid food. For everyone who partakes only of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe. But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, that is, those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil. (Heb 5:12-14)</dr class="alt5"><br>
In other words, when we first begin our pilgrimage in Bible study we learn the basics. As we study the Bible more carefully we begin to learn more details of truth and more properly understand the hidden spiritual truths of God's Word. The basics we learn early in our pilgrimage is the milk and the deeper understanding that comes later is the strong meat.<br> This is why in the above verses and in the following verse that milk is identified with being babes in Christ. <dr class="alt5"> "And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual people but as to carnal, as to babes in Christ. I fed you with milk and not with solid food; for until now you were not able to receive it, and even now you are still not able."
 (1 Cor 3:1-2)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
Maturing from basics 
</h3>
<p>
Just as a baby cannot properly take in strong meat until he or she has grown, a Bible student cannot properly understand the strong meat of the Bible until he or she has a proper understanding of the milk. The Bible teaches that the student must mature from the basic teachings of the Bible in order to understand the deeper, hidden truths that are found. 
 <dr class="alt5">"Whom will he teach knowledge? And whom will he make to understand the message? Those just weaned from milk? Those just drawn from the breasts?". (Isa 28:9)</dr class="alt5">
<br>Being “weaned” from the milk will be in studying the Bible word by word, verse by verse. This is a slow, deliberate process, comparing scripture with scripture in order to come to truth.<dr class="alt5"> “For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line, here a little, there a little” (Isa 28:10)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
Teaching Biblical Doctrine 
</h3>
<p>
This is precisely what the pastors, teachers, priest and theologians of all the churches, regardless of denomination do not do. They build doctrine on a few, isolated verses that they attempt to read and understand as literally as possible. Then they postulate what the verses in question had to do with the people who were contemporary to the passages in view and then try and apply a meaning for us in this day. This is a man made method of interpreting scripture that robs the Bible of its spiritual power and false, man originated doctrine is therefore usurping the proper authority and meaning of the Bible.<br> 
<dr class="alt5">“These people draw near to Me with their mouth, and honour Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me. And in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.” (Matt 15:8-9)</dr class="alt5"><br>
When the teachers in the churches should know the spiritual truths that are revealed in the Bible, they instead are unable to understand its deep truths and keep everyone listening to them in spiritual blindness. <dr class="alt5">“For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the first principles of the oracles of God; and you have come to need milk and not solid food. For everyone who partakes only of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe.” (Heb 5:12-13)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
God’s Illumination 
</h3>
<p>
The true believers have been eating meat and therefore, by God’s Illumination have been able to understand all the amazing information that has been flowing from the Bible by God’s mercy.<br>
Such as what salvation really is. What judgement is, and Christ’s demonstration on the cross of what He endured before He created the world. The Biblical Time line of History and finally the true nature of the Great Tribulation, End of the Church Age, and when Judgement Day will occur.<br>
These are examples of the “meat” of the Word of God. <dr class="alt5">“But solid food belongs to those who are of full age, that is, those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.” (Heb 5:14)</dr class="alt5">
<br>In the context of the time regarding the Great Tribulation, Christ predicted that the true believers would be eating meat and there given understanding of the deeper, hidden truths regarding the end times. <dr class="alt5">“Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his master made ruler over his household, to give them food in due season? Blessed is that servant whom his master, when he comes, will find so doing.” (Matt 24:45-46)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
 Let each of strive to partake of the meat of the Word of God and wean ourselves off of the milk.</p>
<p>
May the Lord Bless you in your reading of His Word, The Bible. </p>
