<h3>
Justification
</h3>
<p>
Justification is the work of God where the righteousness of Jesus is reckoned to the sinner, so the sinner is declared by God as being righteous under the Law (Rom. 4:3; 5:1,9; Gal. 2:16; 3:11).  This righteousness is not earned or retained by any effort of the saved.  Justification is an instantaneous occurrence with the result being eternal life.  It is based completely and solely upon Jesus' sacrifice on the cross (1 Pet. 2:24) and is received by faith alone (Eph. 2:8-9).  No works are necessary whatsoever to obtain justification.  Otherwise, it is not a gift (Rom. 6:23).  Therefore, we are justified by faith (Romans 5:1).
Sanctification is the process of being set apart for God's work and being conformed to the image of Christ.  This conforming to Christ involves the work of the person, but it is still God working in the believer to produce more of a godly character and life in the person who has already been justified (Phil. 2:13).  Sanctification is not instantaneous because it is not the work of God alone.  The justified person is actively involved in submitting to God's will, resisting sin, seeking holiness, and working to be more godly (Gal. 5:22-23).  Significantly, sanctification has no bearing on justification.  That is, even if we don't live a perfect life, we are still justified.</p>
<p>
Where justification is a legal declaration that is instantaneous, sanctification is a process.  Where justification comes from outside of us, from God, sanctification comes from God within us by the work of the Holy Spirit in accordance with the Bible.  In other words, we contribute to sanctification through our efforts.  In contrast, we do not contribute to our justification through our efforts.
<h3>
Redemption
</h3>
<p>
Redemption Defined:  To be set free from captivity or slavery. 
In Old Testament times, it was required that sacrifices be made to cover the penalty of sin.  This temporary redemption involved offering food and animal sacrifices as a substitution for the sin of the people in the tabernacle. The Jewish people were waiting for the promised Messiah who would provide one final blood sacrifice for all sins.  The animal sacrifices covered sins temporarily, but the Messiah would take away sin permanently.</p>
<p>
O Israel, put your hope in the Lord, for with the Lord is unfailing love and with him is full redemption.  He himself will redeem Israel from all their sins. (Psalms 130:7) (NIV)
And in Jesus, the promise of the Messiah was fulfilled.  His substitution for our sins has redeemed us - set us free from sin. 
But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, now crowned with glory and honour because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone. (Hebrews 2:9) (NAS)
“The central theme of redemption in Scripture is that God has taken the initiative to act compassionately on behalf of those who are powerless to help themselves. The New Testament makes clear that divine redemption includes God's identification with humanity in its plight, and the securing of liberation of humankind through the obedience, suffering, death, and resurrection of the incarnate Son.” (Excerpted from Baker’s Evangelical Dictionary of Biblical Theology)</p>
<h3>
Grace
</h3>
<p>
By definition, the word grace means unmerited, unearned, undeserved favour. Therefore, the good news is, grace has nothing to do with you. Grace existed before you ever came to be. Another way of saying it is, grace is God’s part. Faith is defined as being a positive response to what God has already provided by grace. In other words, faith is your positive response to God’s grace, or faith only appropriates what God has already provided for you. Therefore, faith is your part.</p>
<p>
Grace and faith work together, and they must be in balance.
Ephesians 2:8-9 says,

“For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast.”</p>
<p>
Sometimes we read a passage from Scripture that is so familiar, we don’t stop to think about what it is really saying. In this verse, a profound truth is being declared. It says we are saved by grace through faith, not one or the other. Think of it this way—grace is what God does; faith is what we do. It takes both working together to receive salvation.</p>
<p>
Salvation is not dependent on grace alone. If it were, everyone would be saved and going to heaven, for God’s grace is the same toward everyone (Titus 2:11). He has already given the gift of salvation to everyone through Jesus. It is by faith that a person receives what was done 2,000 years ago.</p>
<h3>
Substitution
</h3>
<p>
Substitution lies at the heart of sin and salvation
The concept of substitution may be said to lie at the heart of both sin and salvation. For the essence of sin is man substituting himself for God, while the essence of salvation is God substituting himself for man.</p>
<p>
Man asserts himself against God and puts himself where only God deserves to be; God sacrifices himself for man and puts himself where only man deserves to be. Man claims prerogatives which belong to God alone; God accept penalties which belong to man alone. </p>
 <p>
In this we see the new birth. We see that if we are saved, that our old life is DEAD in Christ, and through the resurrection of Christ, we are born again as a new creation in Christ Jesus.</p>
 <p>
Obviously, this happens, "from the inside out." Your body is not saved, and neither are many other aspects of your make-up, such as emotions. But you now have Christ in us through the Holy Spirit. Those parts of us which are not now saved are to be brought under the control of the Holy Spirit as we go on to grow in the grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ.</p>
 <p>
So salvation is LIFE – we are born again with resurrection life, as a new creation in Christ Jesus. But once we understand that, we also see what salvation is NOT: Salvation is not merely a LEGAL classification before God.</p>
<h3>
 Imputation
</h3>
<p>
The great Truth of justification by faith is based, firstly, on a legal transaction: If I place my faith in Christ, God imputes to me His righteousness, and imputes to Christ my sin. I am then forgiven, and justified, because Christ has died in my place. The salvation I receive is therefore completely legal, moral, and just.</p>
 <p>
But if that were all that salvation consisted of – a legal transaction – there would be no provision made for changing a thing about me. In that case, I might be legally forgiven for sin, and thus, be delivered from punishment, but I would not be delivered from sin itself. Indeed, if salvation is only a legal classification, based on a legal transaction, then it could be said that God saved us while we are yet sinners, but it would be likewise true to say that He saves us as sinner to leave us that way. A legal salvation, in and of itself, does nothing to sanctify anyone.</p>
<p>
This tells us that salvation involves much more than a legal classification – it tells us that God does MORE than simply IMPUTE to us forgiveness and righteousness in a legal sense. Sure. God actually IMPARTS to us the very righteous life of His Son.</p>
 <p>
If we really gave it thought, we would see that only if God IMPARTS to us the life of His son, does the legal IMPUTATION remain moral. For if God merely imputed to me the righteousness of His Son, only to leave me a sinner, in the end God would be licensing sin. No. The reason justification by faith is just, moral, holy, and right, is because along with the legal imputation, God IMPARTS to us the very righteousness of His Son through our resurrection in Him.</p>
 <p>
Now, once we understand that, it ought to make perfect sense that salvation is a new birth as a new creation. You cannot be a new creation, or born again, in merely a legal sense! No. Those things speaks of a living relationship.</p>
<h3>
Forgiveness
</h3>
<p> 
One way to say it is this: In Christ, we do have all of our sins forgiven. That is a fact. But more than merely having all of our sins forgiven, in Christ we are forgiven people. That is what a new creation IS – a forgiven PERSON – because he is born again in Christ.</p>
 <p>
Resurrection life is life that is IMPARTED, not imputed. It is life which has victory over sin and death. It is far beyond anything legal.</p>
 <p>
So salvation is LIFE – not merely imputed life – but imparted life. If we are saved, we got that way by passing FROM death to life, and by being born again a new creation. In effect, we cannot go back! There is no way to be, "born again backwards." Your old life isn’t there any more. You died in Christ.  You cannot LOSE eternal life.</p>
 <p>
Furthermore, your salvation was never based on anything you did. Thus, you cannot lose it by anything you do. Salvation is based solely upon faith. Now, as to the possibility of losing your faith, and thus, "losing" your salvation, this is also not possible. But we’ll get to that later.</p>
 <p>
All of this ought give us the answer as to whether we can lose our salvation: No. We can’t. We cannot lose our salvation, utmost and foremost, because of the nature of salvation. Salvation is life that, by definition, cannot be lost. It isn’t the KIND of life that can be lost, and neither is it received in a way that can be reversed.
How then will one know if their sins are forgiven and dealt with?</p>
<p>
This is how you will know:
<dr class="alt5">
“In Him we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of His grace” (Eph 1:7) </dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">“Whoever commits sin also commits lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness. And you know that He was manifested to take away our sins, and in Him there is no sin. Whoever abides in Him does not sin. Whoever sins has neither seen Him nor known Him.” (1 John 3:4-6)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
<font color="firebrick">
Where the Blood Forgives there it purges and where it purges there was Forgiveness!</font color="firebrick"></p>
<p>
If you still live in the same sins you lived in yesterday and the day before and the month before and the year before then your sins are not forgiven, because where the blood is applied sin loses its hold and grip. How do you know your sins are forgiven? You have been redeemed through His blood = <font color="firebrick">This is what True Forgiveness of Sin</font color="firebrick"> is all about! He that continues and sin and claim forgiveness is deceiving their own selves, the evidence is against them!
<dr class="alt5">“in whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of sins.” Col 1:14</dr class="alt5"> </p>
<p>
How do you know that thousands that say they are forgiven are not forgiven? Because they are still living in their sin! Can someone that say he is washed in the blood of Christ still live and continue in sin as a way of life? NEVER! Is the blood of Christ powerless to save from sin and cleanse from sin?
The evidence that your sins are forgiven is that you no longer live and walk in that sin you use to walk. Don’t fool yourself into a blind faith without works to show for it!</p>
<h3>
Sanctification
</h3>
<p>
Justification is God’s declaration that a believing sinner is righteous because of the merits of Christ imputed to him. Sanctification is the believer leaving the courtroom where God has once and for all time declared him righteous, and immediately beginning the process whereby God’s Spirit enables him to increasingly conform to Christ’s righteousness, both inwardly and outwardly. Jonathan Edwards said of the Christian’s inevitable desire for sanctification, “‘It is as much the nature of one that is spiritually new born, to thirst after growth in holiness, as it is the nature of a newborn babe, to thirst after the mother’s breast.” The process is progressive, but is never completed in this life. Sanctification is ultimately fulfilled in glorification.</p>
<p>
In one sense we may say that sanctification has nothing to do with regeneration or justification, and yet it has everything to do with demonstrating that one has experienced them. (Notice statements similar to “We know that we have passed out of death into life, because . . .” in the letter of 1 John.) Sanctification alone doesn’t save, but there is no salvation without it. As Paul told the Thessalonian believers,<dr class="alt5"> “... God from the beginning chose you for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth,.” (2 Thess. 2:13)</dr class="alt5">. The experience of salvation begins with regeneration and justification, continues with sanctification, and is fulfilled in glorification. All who are regenerated and justified are being sanctified. All who are being sanctified will eventually be glorified. While we may distinguish between regeneration, justification, sanctification, and glorification, we must not separate them. In other words, the person who truly experiences one will experience them all (and in the order listed.)</p>
<p>
So the old theological shorthand that “we have been saved, we are being saved, and we will be saved” applies here. Sanctification isn’t included in the “we have been saved” part of salvation, but it is synonymous with the “we are being saved” part. And without sanctification, there is no “we will be saved.” For as Heb 12 teaches, “Pursue peace with all people, and holiness, without which no one will see the Lord:.” (Heb. 12:14)</p>
<p>
How do I “Pursue . . . the holiness without which no one will see the Lord”? Unlike regeneration, there is much Spirit-filled human effort involved in sanctification. On the one hand, <dr class="alt5">“for it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure” (Phil 2:13)</dr class="alt5">. On the other hand, we’re commanded in 1 Tim,<dr class="alt5"> “reject profane and old wives fables, and exercise yourself toward godliness.” (1 Tim. 4:7)</dr class="alt5"> God uses means of grace to sanctify us, chief of which are the personal and corporate spiritual disciplines. In the personal realm, these include intake of God’s Word, prayer, private worship, fasting, silence and solitude, etc. These are balanced by disciplines we practice with the church: public worship, hearing God’s Word preached, observance of the ordinances, corporate prayer, fellowship, etc. And all along, our confidence is not in ourselves, but in God. As Paul put it, <dr class="alt5">“being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ” (Phil. 1:6).</dr class="alt5"></p>
