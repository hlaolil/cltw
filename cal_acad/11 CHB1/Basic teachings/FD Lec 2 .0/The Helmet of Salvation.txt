The Helmet of Salvation
</h1>
<p>
When Paul wrote to the Ephesians about the helmet of salvation, some of them may have found the analogy to be a familiar one. In the book of Isaiah, a description of God shows Him as having put on both the breastplate of righteousness and the helmet of salvation (Isaiah 59:17). In referencing this Old Testament scripture, Paul drives home the point that it is in every sense of the word the armour of Godâ€”the same armour He Himself wears. But it also leads us to consider what salvation is, what it has to do with a helmet and what it means for us.</p>

<h3>
What is salvation?

<p>
Salvation basically means to be saved or delivered from something (see examples in Exodus 14:13 and Micah 7:6-8). In the New Testament, as we will see, it is generally used to refer to deliverance from the eternal death penalty of sin and deliverance into God's Kingdom.</p>
