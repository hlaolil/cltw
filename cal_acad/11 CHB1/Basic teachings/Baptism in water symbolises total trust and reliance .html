   <h1>
Baptism in water is <br>commanded by Christ
</h1>
<p>
Water baptism symbolises the believer’s total trust in, and total reliance on, the Lord Jesus Christ, as well as a commitment to live obediently to Him.<br> It also symbolises unity with <dr class="alt5">fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God (Eph 2:19)</dr class="alt5">, that is, with every person in every nation on earth that is a member of the body of Christ <dr class="alt5">for you are all one in Christ Jesus.<br> (Gal 3:27-28)</dr class="alt5">. <br>
Water baptism expresses this and more, but it is not an entrance into Christianity. Instead we are baptised because our Lord commanded it and because we obey Him.<dr class="alt5"> "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,” (Matt 28:19)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
Before we are baptised we must come to believe that we are sinners in need of salvation <dr class="alt5">for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, (Rom 3:23)</dr class="alt5">.<br> We must also believe that Christ died on the cross to atone for our sins, that He was buried, and that He was resurrected to assure our place in heaven <br>(1 Cor 15:1-4).<br> We then turn to Jesus, asking Him to forgive our sins and to be our Lord and Saviour, and the moment we do that we are born again, our eternal salvation is guaranteed, and we begin to die to ourselves and live for Christ (1 Peter 1:3-5). At this time we are qualified to be scripturally baptised.</p>
<p>
At the river, pool or baptismal font, we let ourselves be completely immersed in the water. This symbolises burial with our Lord; we are baptised into His death on the cross and are no longer slaves to self or sin (Rom 6:3-7). When we are raised out of the water, we are symbolically resurrected—raised to our new life in Christ and to be with Him forever, born into the family of our loving God <br>(Rom 8:16).</p>
<p>
The fact that baptism is not a prerequisite for salvation is best seen in the example of a saved man who was not baptised in water, the criminal on the cross (Luke 23:39-43). This self-confessed sinner came to acknowledge Jesus as his Lord while dying on a cross next to Him, and he asked for salvation and was forgiven of his sins. Although he never experienced water baptism, at that moment he was baptised into Christ’s death, and he then was raised to life by the power of Christ’s word (Hebrews 1:3).</p>
<p>
Christians have been commanded to be baptised, and we should do so out of obedience to, and love for, our Lord Christ Jesus <dr class="alt5">“If you love Me, keep My commandments. (John 14:15)</dr class="alt5">.<br> Water baptism is the biblical method of baptism because of its symbolic representation of the death, burial, and resurrection of Christ.</p>
