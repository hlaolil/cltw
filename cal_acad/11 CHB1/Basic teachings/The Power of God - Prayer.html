The Power of God - Prayer
</h1>
<h3>
Prayers
</h3>
<p>
Millions of religious people pray every day to some higher power 

they call God. But do their prayers mean anything? Is anyone up 

there really listening? The Bible shows us that prayer really does 

make a difference. You can get answers to your prayers, if you 

genuinely act on the inspired instructions of your Bible!</p>
<p>
Perhaps you pray. Perhaps you tried to pray and became discouraged 

because you didn't seem to get any answers. Maybe you memorised 

prayers as a ritual and hope that some kind of superstitious 

obeisance to an unknown God will somehow keep you out of Hell.</p>
<p>
But what does the Bible say? In His kindness and mercy to tiny 

human beings, God has given us the gift of truth through the book 

we call the Holy Bible. But you must read it and seek to have a 

relationship with its author, the Creator God and His Son Jesus 

Christ. And when you do, you'll find the Bible gives us promises 

that money can't buy! Take a look at one of the Bible's promises of 

what God can do for you: <dr class="alt5">"Now to Him who is able 

to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask or think, 

according to the power that works in us," ((Eph 3:20))</dr 

class="alt5"> Listen to what the Bible claims God can do for you! 

God <dr class="alt5">"is able to do exceedingly abundantly above 

all that we ask or think!"</dr class="alt5">. </p>
<p>
What kind of problems do you have? Do you have health problems? 

Financial problems? Mental health problems? Employment problems? 

Family problems? Social problems? Academic problems? God can help 

you solve <i>any problem you have</i>! Of course you have to do 

<i>your</i> part, but the Creator God has <i>all power</i> in the 

universe. He can give you dramatic deliverance and help you in 

miraculous ways! </p>
<p>
If God is to help solve your problems and answer your prayers, what 

does He expect of <i>you</i>? See what the Bible tells us: "But 

without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to 

God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who 

diligently seek Him." (Heb 11:6)</p>
<p>
As you read the Bible accounts of how God helped people and 

delivered them from tremendous stresses and trials, you will come 

to have more faith. Read the stories of Daniel in the lions' den; 

the deliverance of Shadrach, Meshech and Abednego from the fiery 

furnace of Nebuchadnezzar in Babylon; and the escape of the ancient 

Israelites through the Red Sea. Read about the miracles performed 

by Jesus of Nazareth—the Son of God—in healing the diseased, the 

blind, the lame, and the deaf. Read of how Jesus raised the dead to 

life! This will help give you faith and hope!</p>
<p>
The prophet Jeremiah gave hope to the people of ancient Judah whom 

Nebuchadnezzar had taken captive to Babylon. After they learned 

their lessons, God promised to respond to their humble prayer:<dr 

class="alt5"> "For thus says the Lord: After seventy years are 

completed at Babylon, I will visit you and perform My good word 

toward you, and cause you to return to this place. For I know the 

thoughts that I think toward you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace 

and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope. Then you will 

call upon Me and go and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. And 

you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your 

heart. I will be found by you, says the Lord, and I will bring you 

back from your captivity; I will gather you from all the nations 

and from all the places where I have driven you, says the Lord, and 

I will bring you to the place from which I cause you to be carried 

away captive." (Jer 29:10–14)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
That same principle applies to you! You can have a conversation 

with the Creator of the Universe! He says you can find Him, if you 

seek Him with your whole heart. You can pray or talk to Him and He 

says: "I will listen to you!" </p>

can have a conversation with the Creator of the Universe! He says 

you can find Him, if you seek Him with your whole heart. You can 

pray or talk to Him and He says: "I will listen to you!"
How should we Pray?
<h3>
<p>
What does the Bible teach us regarding how we should pray? After 

Jesus chose his disciples, they asked Him to teach them to pray: 

<dr class="alt5">"Now it came to pass, as He was praying in a 

certain place, when He ceased, that one of His disciples said to 

Him, “Lord, teach us to pray, as John also taught his disciples.” 

(Luke 11:1)</dr class="alt5">. What did Jesus teach them? He gave 

His disciples an outline of subjects to talk to God about. "So He 

said to them pray, saying:<dr class="alt5"> Our Father in heaven, 

Hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done on 

earth as it is in heaven. Give us day by day our daily bread. And 

forgive us our sins, for we also forgive everyone who is indebted 

to us. And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the 

evil one.” (Luke 11:2–4)<dr class="alt5">. </p>
<p>
Christ's "model prayer" shows us that the first important aspect of 

our prayer is the acknowledgement of who God is! He is our Father. 

The Apostle Paul describes this relationship in prayer: <dr 

class="alt5">"For this reason I bow my knees to the Father of our 

Lord Jesus Christ, from whom the whole family in heaven and earth 

is named, (Eph 3:14–15)</dr class="alt5">. Since God is your 

Father, He wants you to acknowledge yourself as His son or 

daughter, and recognise in your prayers the very personal and 

intimate relationship that He desires to share with you. You may 

also want to acknowledge God as the Creator, as King David often 

did in his prayers, many of which are recorded in the book of 

Psalms in your Bible.</p>
<p>
If ever you feel that you do not know what to pray about, just open 

your Bible to the book of Psalms. Many of the Psalms are the 

heartfelt prayers of David. He was very straightforward, open and 

honest with God about his feelings, his anxieties and his problems. 

David stood in awe at the heavens and the expansiveness of the 

Creation. You can see this in so many of the Psalms; look 

especially at Psalm 8, or Psalms 18, 19 and 24 to be inspired by 

David's example.
<h3>
Pray for His Kingdom and His Will
</h3>
<p>
What is the next subject Jesus shows us we should pray about? <dr 

class="alt5">"Your kingdom come" (Luke 11:2)<dr class="alt5">. You 

will want to follow Christ's example by praying for His Work—that 

the good news, the gospel will be preached in all the world. Why 

does Jesus Christ need to come back and rule over the whole earth? 

When you read your daily newspaper or listen to the news, don't you 

often utter an immediate, heartfelt prayer for God's Kingdom to 

come soon? The tragedies of Kosovo, the violence, murders and 

killings—even in our schools—make us yearn for God's Kingdom.</p> 
<p>
Our prayers should reflect this yearning. The whole world needs the 

Kingdom of God. It needs to be re educated to uphold godly values—

the way of life that produces joy and peace. That is the way of 

God's law. Jesus will teach the whole world the true way of living

—including the Ten Commandments and their magnification and 

application. There is a way of love that produces right results. 

Every nation on earth needs that kind of education!</p>
<p>
Jesus next taught us in the outline prayer the importance of 

seeking to do God's will and not our own. Jesus taught us to pray: 

<dr class="alt5">"Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven" 

(Luke 11:2)</dr class="alt5">. This is an extremely important key 

to answered prayer. Human beings are by nature extremely selfish. 

The worldly view is one of lust and greed. We all have had, and 

maybe you still have, the "get" motive! Billions just want their 

lusts to be satiated. They want their own way. We read in Proverbs 

14: <dr class="alt5">"There is a way that seems right to a man, but 

its end is the way of death" (Prov 14:12)<dr class="alt5">. But 

God's way, exemplified by Jesus of Nazareth, is the "give" way! Is 

that the way you pray? Do you pray for others before you pray for 

yourself? Pray for God's will to be done in your life—He knows what 

is best for us! </p>
<p>
When Jesus prayed in agony the night before His crucifixion, He 

asked that the cup of suffering be passed from Him if it were God's 

will! In Luke 22, Jesus prayed: <dr class="alt5">"Father, if it is 

Your will, take this cup away from Me; nevertheless not My will, 

but Yours, be done."  Then an angel appeared to Him from heaven, 

strengthening Him. And being in agony, He prayed more earnestly. 

Then His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the 

ground." (Luke 22:42-44)</dr class="alt5"> </p>
<p>
Jesus was willing to suffer for <i>you</i>! He surrendered His will 

to that of the Father's will! When you are struggling over some 

problem or trial, ask for God's deliverance, but also pray that His 

will be done. Do you fear that this is too much to ask, and that 

you cannot handle a trial? Notice that God strengthened Jesus to 

endure the sacrifice He was to make.</p>
<h3>
Claim Promises through Prayer
</h3>
<p>
God also makes His will known in the thousands of promises He gives 

us in the Bible. You can claim those promises! Let us look at a 

couple of them. <dr class="alt5">"And my God shall supply all your 

need according to His riches in glory by Christ Jesus" (Phil 

4:19)</dr class="alt5">. What do you have need of? Do you have need 

of food or clothing? Do you have need of a job? Then ask! God 

promises to provide your every need, but you must do your part! 

What did Jesus say? <dr class="alt5">"Ask, and it will be given to 

you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you" 

(Matt 7:7)</dr class="alt5">. As long as you are asking God's will 

to be done, not your own, He will provide your every need as He has 

promised!</p>
<p>
We have other needs that we sometimes do not really recognise, such 

as being put back on the right spiritual track when we have gone 

astray. Sometimes we need correction. We can be comforted to 

realise that our Lord will give us the guidance we need to get back 

on the right track. Sometimes this can be painful, but it is always 

for our benefit (cf. Hebrews 12). </p>
<p>
If we are to experience the power of prayer, seeking God's will, we 

must have our priorities straight. What are your priorities in 

life? Do you know what your goal in life should be? In the sixth 

chapter of the book of Matthew, Jesus emphasised that God will 

provide our needs, but that we also have a role to play:<dr 

class="alt5"> "But seek first the kingdom of God and His 

righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you" (Matt 

6:33)<dr class="alt5">. To what "things" was Jesus referring? He 

was speaking of all the physical things humans need and often worry 

about because they do not trust God! Jesus chided these fearful 

people for their anxieties:<dr class="alt5"> "Now if God so clothes 

the grass of the field, which today is, and tomorrow is thrown into 

the oven, will He not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?" 

(Matt 6:30)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
That's right! There is no need to fear! God has made the wonderful 

promise that as we seek first the Kingdom of God, we will also be 

establishing a close relationship with our Father in Heaven, and 

with His Son—our Saviour—Jesus Christ. God knows what we have need 

of, but He wants us to learn to trust Him and to be dependent upon 

Him. </p>
<h3>
Pray from the Heart
</h3>
<p>
Another very basic principle in experiencing the power of prayer is 

this: Just speak from the heart. You do not need to get caught up 

in memorised prayers that become vain and meaningless. In Matthew's 

gospel, Jesus warned us about useless repetitions: <dr 

class="alt5">"And when you pray, do not use vain repetitions as the 

heathen do. For they think that they will be heard for their many 

words. “Therefore do not be like them. For your Father knows the 

things you have need of before you ask Him." (Matt 6:7–8)</dr 

class="alt5">. Many different religions emphasise repetitious 

prayers—saying the same few words over and over again, or using 

prayer wheels or prayer flags that supposedly send a message from 

the practitioner to his unseen god. God says all of that is in 

vain! Remember, God expects you to seek a <i>personal</i> 

relationship with Him. Since He knows your needs, simple requests 

may be all that are necessary, but one must be sincere and 

heartfelt as you would be in dealing with a loved one!</p> 
<p>
You may be familiar with John 10 in which Jesus said: <dr 

class="alt5">"I have come that they may have life, and that they 

may have it more abundantly." (John 10:10)</dr class="alt5"> 

Christians do suffer and experience many trials in life. But they 

have the power of Christ to help them endure. They also have the 

opportunity to recapture the true values of life and abundant 

living. So in addition to God's promise that He will provide our 

every need, there is a special promise concerning the desires of 

our heart. <dr class="alt5">"Delight yourself also in the Lord, And 

He shall give you the desires of your heart" (Psa 37:4)</dr 

class="alt5">. What an amazing promise! Obviously these must be 

lawful desires, in harmony with God's will. But if you are in 

harmony with God's will, then there are so many ways in which God 

is eager to enrich your life and fulfil your desires. God keeps His 

promises, but we must claim them with patience and faith and 

obedience.</p>
<h3>
Prayer and Unrepentant Sinners
</h3>
<p>
God wants you to pray to Him and to share your life with Him. And 

as we've seen, prayer changes things. Prayer is your lifeline to 

God. But does God hear the prayers of unrepentant sinners? Let us 

understand: one cannot continue to practice sin and think that God 

will hear his prayers. As the prophet Isaiah wrote:<dr 

class="alt5"> "Behold, the Lord’s hand is not shortened, that it 

cannot save; nor His ear heavy, that it cannot hear. But your 

iniquities have separated you from your God; and your sins have 

hidden His face from you, so that He will not hear." (Isaiah 59:1-

2)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
God will not hear the prayers of hardened, unrepentant, practising 

sinners. But what if you really, deeply, want to change your life? 

What if your heartfelt desire is to be delivered from your sinful 

habits? If you really want God's help to repent and change, and if 

you exercise the courage to step out and confess your sins 

personally and privately to God, then God will help you.</p>
<p>
How do you know He will? Scripture illustrates this with Christ's 

story of the Pharisee and the publican:<dr class="alt5"> "Also He 

spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were 

righteous, and despised others: “Two men went up to the temple to 

pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee 

stood and prayed thus with himself, ‘God, I thank You that I am not 

like other men—extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this 

tax collector. I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I 

possess.’ And the tax collector, standing afar off, would not so 

much as raise his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, 

‘God, be merciful to me a sinner!’ I tell you, this man went down 

to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who 

exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be 

exalted.” (Luke 18:9–14).</dr class="alt5"> </p>
<p>
God will not hear the prayers of an unrepentant sinner. But He will 

hear your prayer if you are deeply and sincerely sorry, and if you 

acknowledge your sinfulness, just as God heard the humble 

confession of the publican. As the Apostle John wrote: <dr 

class="alt5">"If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to 

forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness" (1 

John 1:9)</dr class="alt5">. That is God's promise. It takes 

courage to admit our sins. But we must all humble ourselves and 

seek God with all our heart.</p> 
<p>
What will happen when we do this? God tells us in Isaiah 55: <dr 

class="alt5">"Seek the Lord while He may be found, Call upon Him 

while He is near. Let the wicked forsake his way, And the 

unrighteous man his thoughts; Let him return to the Lord, And He 

will have mercy on him; And to our God, For He will abundantly 

pardon." (Isa 55:6–7)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
God wants to share eternity with us. As a loving Father, He 

promises to give us our basic needs. He promises to give us "good 

things." And He promises to give us the desires of our heart. But 

we must be willing to seek Him, trust Him and obey Him. Read your 

Bible and follow the instructions of your Saviour in praying to 

your Father in Heaven! You will be on your way to forgiveness, 

mercy, understanding and indescribable blessings and victories over 

sin. Remember the promise of Ephesians 3:20 that God <dr 

class="alt5">"is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that 

we ask or think."<dr class="alt5"> Claim God's promises. Establish 

that lifeline of prayer! It will mean a new life for you now in 

this age, and the promise of life for eternity through our living 

Saviour, Jesus Christ.</p>
