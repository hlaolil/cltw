Baptism in the Holy Spirit
</h1>
<p>
Baptism of the Holy Spirit1 is a term used to describe a movement of the Spirit upon and/or within a believer usually sometime after the person is saved. <br> There is controversy surrounding this phenomenon as to whether it is legitimate or not.  Some people believe that once a person is saved the Holy Spirit is in the person and there is no subsequent "baptism in the Holy Spirit."  In other words, they maintain that this Baptism of the Spirit occurs at salvation.  Others believe that it is possible for the Christian to experience an additional movement of the Holy Spirit sometime after salvation.  Generally speaking, it is the charismatic movement that supports the Baptism of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>
We need to know first that all Christians receive the Spirit upon their conversion and in this sense all Christians have been baptised in the Holy Spirit. <br> This means that they are saved and that they have all they need at that time to be able to live godly and holy lives. <br> 1 Cor 12 says,<dr class="alt5"> "For by one Spirit we were all baptised into one bodyówhether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or freeóand have all been made to drink into one Spirit." (1 Cor 12:13)<dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
However, there are many Christians who claim to have had this "secondary" experience of the Spirit. They say that it has brought great blessing and comfort to them.  Furthermore, they say that the results of the experience is a renewed dedication and appreciation for God, a stronger desire to read the Bible, a stronger desire to fellowship with Christians, and a deeper sense of worship of God.  Millions of Christians who claim to have had this experience forces us to deal with the issue.  Is it real or not?  Let's look at the Scripture to find out.</p>
<p>
The term "baptise with the Holy Spirit" occurs several times in scripture:
<p>
<dr class="alt5">"As for me, I baptise you with water for repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, and I am not fit to remove His sandals; He will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and fire." (Matt. 3:11)</dr class="alt5">  </p>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">"I baptised you with water; but He will baptise you with the Holy Spirit."<br> (Mark 1:8)</dr class="alt5"> ù</p>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">"John answered and said to them all, 'As for me, I baptise you with water; but One is coming who is mightier than I, and I am not fit to untie the thong of His sandals; He will baptise you with the Holy Spirit and fire." (Luke 3:16)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
 <dr class="alt5">"And I did not recognize Him, but He who sent me to baptise in water said to me, "He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining upon Him, this is the one who baptises in the Holy Spirit." (John 1:33)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
 <dr class="alt5">"for John baptised with water, but you shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit not many days from now." (Acts 1:5)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
 <dr class="alt5">"And I remembered the word of the Lord, how He used to say, 'John baptised with water, but you shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit." (Acts 11:16)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
We can clearly see that the phrase is used in the Bible.  But, we do not find a clear teaching in the Bible of what the phrase means.  Nevertheless, we can conclude that when a person is baptised in the Holy Spirit he has power bestowed upon him. <br> This power is for the purpose of the preaching of the gospel (Acts 4:31), living a purer life, and having a deeper devotion to God.  Also, it is frequently accompanied by speaking in tongues (not all people are gifted by the Holy Spirit this way). <dr class="alt5">"And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance." (Acts 2:4)</dr class="alt5"><br> At this point, I would recommend the reader to examine Acts 1-2 to see the movement of the Holy Spirit upon the early church at Pentecost.</p>
<p>
The issue now seems to be whether or not Baptism of/in/with the Holy Spirit is a subsequent event occurring after salvation.  It would seem that this is the case.  In John 20, Jesus commanded<dr class="alt5"> As the Father has sent Me, I also send you and when He had said this, He breathed on them, and said to them, ìReceive the Holy Spiritî (John 20:21-22)</dr class="alt5"> This means that they were saved since the Holy Spirit is not received by the unregenerate. <br> Then, later in Acts 1 we read,<dr class="alt5"> "And being assembled together with them, He commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the Promise of the Father, ìwhich,î He said, ìyou have heard from Me; for John truly baptised with water, but you shall be baptised with the Holy Spirit not many days from now.îù (Acts 1:4-5)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
The danger of this phenomena is the potential division of the body of Christ into two categories:  those who are "regular" Christians and those who have been baptised in the Holy Spirit.  This, of course, would be an incorrect way of looking at Christians, and this is why.  If you were to step outside into a soft mist, it would take a long time to get completely wet.  On the other hand, if you were to step into a torrential rain, you'd be drenched quickly.</p>
<p>
Those who have not experienced the Baptism of the Holy Spirit (meaning a sudden and powerful experience) are not second-class citizens by any means.  They are the ones in the gentle mist who experience the Lord over a long period of time and get just as blessed as those who suddenly step into the torrent of the Spirit's presence.  In fact, the Baptism of the Spirit can be a pitfall since so many people who have experienced it long for it again, almost to the point of putting the validity of their faith in the experience instead of the clear teaching of the word of God.</p>
<p>
We must all be careful not to fall in our strengths as well as our weaknesses.</p>
