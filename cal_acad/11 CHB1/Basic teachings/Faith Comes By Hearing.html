Faith Comes By Hearing
</h1>
<p> 
We believe in salvation by faith, as faith is the base from whence all acceptable relations to God must spring. But how does one obtain this faith?</p>
<p>
A traditional concept, basic to much Lutheran, Presbyterian, and other doctrine, makes faith a "gift of God"-- something God directly puts in the heart of the individual. Man is thought to be so depraved, so opposed to anything good, that direct divine intervention is necessary to make man receptive to the things of God.</p>
<p>
But reflection upon the very meaning of "faith" would show us that it is an act of man's, something man does. He "believes" or refuses to "believe" evidence. <br>If man is incapable of accepting the evidence offered by God, then he could in no wise be held accountable for such failure. If God must directly and individually make Tom, Dick and Harry capable of believing, then the fate of each man is wholly a matter of God's choice, and man is no free moral agent-- he is but a pawn in God's game of chess-- a game which He plays with Himself.</p>
<p>
But Christ invites, <dr class="alt5">"Come to Me, all you who labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." (Matt 11:28)</dr class="alt5"> Is this an empty, mocking invitation?<br> In Matt 13 Christ chides some because <dr class="alt5">"their eyes they have closed;</dr class="alt5"> but to others says, <dr class="alt5">"Blessed are your eyes for they see, and your ears for they hear." (Matt 13:13)</dr class="alt5"> <br>The <dr class="alt5">"whoever believes" (John. 3:16)</dr class="alt5">, and<br> <dr class="alt5">"Repent, and let every one of you be baptised" (Acts 2:38)</dr class="alt5">, are cumulative proofs of the freedom of man to accept divine evidence, and divine grace. </p>
<p>
Salvation is the gift of God (Eph. 2:8) and "faith" is given only in that God produces and provides that which man must believe and act upon.<br>

Read and appreciate Rom. 10:13-17. <font color="firebrick">Faith comes by hearing God's Word!!</font>
