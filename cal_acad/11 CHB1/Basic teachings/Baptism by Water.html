<h3>
1. Is Water Baptism Necessary for Salvation?
</h3>
<p>
We do not believe that water baptism adds one thing to our salvation. We are saved by grace and grace alone. It is the command of the Lord for us to testify to our identification in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ by being baptised. <br>It is, as far as salvation is concerned, entirely a matter of personal likes and if one believes that he should not be baptised, he would, of course, be a hypocrite if he submitted to it. However, if we believe it is for us, we would be displeasing the Lord if we did not do it. The important thing is that we can continue to love one another even though we do not agree on all points in this matter</p>
<h3>
2. Should All Believers Be Baptised?
</h3>
<p>
Yes, we believe it is the duty of every believer to submit to baptism, not as a matter of salvation, but as a matter of obedience. There is no baptism by sprinkling in the Bible. It is always (as the original Greek indicates) by immersion. Water baptism has nothing to do with our salvation, but I do believe it becomes the Christian's duty to submit to it.<p>
<h3>
3. Should Infants Be Baptised?
</h3>
<p>
We believe that baptism must follow conversion. Regarding children, I believe it is good to dedicate infants and children to the Lord, but dedication is not baptism. Dedication is the act of the parent, in which he presents his child to God and assumes responsibility for the training of that child for Him. Baptism, however, is the act of the believer himself, in which he confesses faith in the Lord Jesus who “died for ours sins and rose again for our justification.”</p>  
<h3>
4. Is Infant Baptism Taught in the Bible?
</h3>
<p>
It is a doctrine of the church which is certainly not founded upon the Word of God, but is a remnant of Roman Catholicism. There is not a single clear instance of it in the Bible, and no trace of it until three hundred years after Pentecost. It is a wholly unscriptural doctrine of man. I would suggest that you limit your studies more to the Scriptures rather than the doctrinal standards of the church.</p>
<h3>
5. Is the Doctrine of Baptismal Regeneration Scriptural?
</h3>
<p>
Regarding this question, Acts 2:38 and Acts 22:16 do not teach baptismal regeneration. You will notice in Acts 2:38 that repentance is mentioned first. Christ and His apostles taught that baptism with water is an ordinance to be obeyed as an outward testimony of an inward change of heart, but they did not teach that one must be baptised in order to be saved. Acts 22 has nothing to do with the matter of water taking away sin.<br>The testimony of Paul is here to give witness to the fact that his sins have been washed away. The literal rendering of this passage is generally accepted as <br><dr class="alt5">“And now why are you waiting? Arise and be baptised, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.”(Acts 22:16 </dr class="alt5">)<br> The thief on the cross never was baptised. Please note<dr class="alt5"> He who believes and is baptised will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned <br> (Mark 16:16).</dr class="alt5">
<br> This text does not say, “He that is not baptised shall be  condemned,” but only “He who does not believe.”</p>
<h3>
6. What does the Word “Water” in John 3 mean 
</h3>
<p>
I believe that the word “water” refers to the physical birth, that is, the flesh. <br>I think this is very clear from what Jesus said in John 3,<dr class="alt5"> “That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.” ( John 3:6)</dr class="alt5"> <br>The Lord contrasts the physical birth to the spiritual birth, which I think clearly evidences the meaning of “water” <dr class="alt5">unless one is born of water and the Spirit, (John 3:5).<dr class="alt5">
<h3>
7. Who Should Be Baptised?
</h3>
<p>
In regard to the question concerning baptism, let me repeat that water baptism is not a saving ordinance, but rather a blessed privilege on the part of God's children as a testimony for Him. It is a privilege rather than a command. In regard to I Corinthians 1:14, please note that Paul definitely states that he did baptise some of the Corinthians, but because they made it such an issue, he was thankful that he did not baptise any more of them. I believe that a man must follow the leading of the Holy Spirit in these matters. If God convicts us of the need of baptism, we are disobedient if we refuse. However, I do not believe that anyone should be baptised who does not fully desire in this way to witness for the Lord Jesus Christ. Throughout the book of Acts, both Jews and Gentiles were baptised as a testimony to their identification to Christ. One can be saved without baptism, but to refuse to be baptised makes one a disobedient believer.</p>
<h3>
8. Who Can Perform Baptism?
</h3>
<p>
From the Scripture, there is no reason whatsoever to believe that a special clergyman or preacher must perform baptism. Any born-again believer has the right to baptise another. For the sake of order, I suppose the other method, limiting the right to a certain class, was adopted. 
<h3>
9. I Was Sprinkled As an Infant.<br> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Should I Be Re-Baptised by Immersion?
</h3>
<p>
One can be re-baptised by immersion as a testimony of personal faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Sprinkling is not baptism, since so-called infant baptism is merely a dedication. We do not believe that baptism adds to our salvation, or makes us fit for heaven. It is only our own personal testimony, and so all I can say is, you just follow the leading of the Lord and do as He convicts you. </p>
<h3>
10. Is the Gift of Tongues for This Age?
</h3>
<p>
According to I Corinthians 13, these special signs ceased when Revelation (the Bible) was completed. It is not a matter of whether God is able to do these things, but entirely a matter of whether they are for this age and dispensation. Tongues together with other miracles were apostolic and ceased with the apostolic age.</p>
<h3>
11. When did the Signs,Gifts and By Laying On of Hands Cease 
</h3>
<p>
Signs and gifts were committed by the Lord Jesus to the apostles and they were definitely apostolic gifts for the apostolic age only. In the New Testament, the apostles received these gifts by the laying on of hands to others as the Spirit directed. However, with them the signs and gifts ceased, and there is not a single instance in the Bible where anyone except the twelve apostles could transmit these gifts to others. Those upon whom they laid their hands could perform signs, but they were never able to give this to anyone else. It, therefore, passed with the death of the apostles, and so we believe that all who claim to have this apostolic gift today are frauds and deceivers.</p>
<h3>
12. Explanation of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit and Tongues 
</h3>
<p>
In regard to the baptism of the Holy Spirit, we believe that every believer when he accepts the Lord Jesus Christ receives the baptism in the Holy Spirit and needs nothing more, except to grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. I do not believe that the gift of tongues is for this present dispensation, and therefore, if we ask for more than just God's promise, we are asking for something with which the Lord is not pleased. I believe that there are many sincere people who believe in the work of “baptism” in the Holy Spirit and tongues, but I also believe that they are wrong, and not in harmony with the clear revelation of the Word of God.</p>
<h3>
13. Why Was Christ Baptised?
</h3>
<p>
In regard to the baptism of Christ, the Scripture says this was done to fulfil all righteousness. It was to identify Himself with the people whom He came to save that Christ was baptised, although He had no sin. It was His declaration of willingness to go through death and resurrection for His people.</p>
