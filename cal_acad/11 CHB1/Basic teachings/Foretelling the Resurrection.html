Foretelling of the Resurrection
</h1>
<p>
Throughout the Hebrew Scriptures, the promise of a Messiah is clearly given. These messianic prophecies were made hundreds, sometimes thousands of years before Jesus Christ was born, and clearly Jesus Christ is the only person who has ever walked this earth to fulfil them.<br> The death and resurrection of the Jewish Messiah was well documented in the Hebrew prophetic Scriptures long before the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ occurred in history.</p>
<h3>
Prophesies of the Resurrection
</h3>
<p>
The clearest and best known of the resurrection prophecies is the one penned by Israel’s King David in Psalm 16:10, also written a millennium before the birth of Jesus: <dr class="alt5">“For You will not abandon my soul to Sheol; Nor will You allow Your Holy One to undergo decay.” (Psalm 16:10)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
On the Jewish feast day of Shavuot (Weeks or Pentecost), when Peter preached the first gospel sermon, he boldly asserted that God had raised Jesus the Jewish Messiah from the dead (Acts 2:24). He then explained that God had performed this miraculous deed in fulfilment of David's prophecy in Psalm 16. In fact, Peter quoted the words of David in detail as contained in Psalm 16:8–11. Some years later, Paul did the same thing when he spoke to the Jewish community in Antioch. Like Peter, Paul declared that God had raised Messiah Jesus from the dead in fulfilment of Psa 16:10.<br> (Acts 13:33–35).</p>
<p>
The resurrection of the Messiah is strongly implied in another Davidic psalm. This is in Psalm 22 when the suffering Saviour prays for deliverance <dr class="alt5">“from the lion’s mouth” (Psa 22:19–21)</dr class="alt5"> (a metaphor for Satan). This desperate prayer is then followed immediately in verses Psa 22:22–24 by a hymn of praise in which the Messiah thanks God for hearing His prayer and delivering Him. The resurrection of the Messiah is clearly implied between the ending of the prayer in Psa 22:21 and the beginning of the praise song in Psa 22:22.</p>
<p>
And back again to Isaiah 53, after prophesying that the Suffering Servant of God would suffer for the sins of His people, He would then be <dr class="alt5">“cut off out of the land of the living.” </dr class="alt5">But Isaiah then states that He (Messiah) <dr class="alt5">“will see His offspring” and that God the Father will “prolong His days” (Isaiah 53:5, 8, 10)</dr class="alt5">. Isaiah proceeds to reaffirm the promise of the resurrection in different words: <dr class="alt5">“As a result of the anguish of His soul, He will see light and be satisfied” (Isaiah 53:11)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
Every aspect of the birth, life, death and resurrection of Jesus the Messiah had been prophesied in the Hebrew Scriptures long before the events ever unfolded in the time line of human history. No wonder that Jesus the Messiah would say to the Jewish religious leaders of His day, <dr class="alt5">“You search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and these are they which testify of Me” (John 5:39)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
