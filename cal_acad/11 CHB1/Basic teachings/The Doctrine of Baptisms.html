   <h1>
The Doctrine of Baptisms
</h1>
<p><dr class="alt5">
Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ,
let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation
of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,
Of <font color="firebrick">the doctrine of baptisms </font>, and of 

laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal 

judgement. (Heb 6:1-2)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
Baptisms
</h3>
<p>
Baptisms (it is plural, See Heb 6:1,2) is an important doctrine in Christianity. </p>
 <p>The water baptism, known as baptism in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (Matt 28:19)</p>
 <p>(Trinity baptism or baptism in the name of Jesus Christ) (Acts 8:16)</p> 
<p>Baptism of the Holy Spirit, and baptism of fire (Luke 3:16).</p> 
<p>There is also the Baptism of John the Baptist, which is now obsolete.</p> <p>Since all of these are important, I will cover all of them.</p>
<h3>
Water Baptism
</h3>
<p>
Water baptism is a necessary act in Christian life. It does not and 

cannot save you (we are saved by grace through faith).

We should be baptised because Jesus told us to: <dr class="alt5">“Go 

therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptising them ...” 

(Matt 28:19)</dr class="alt5">, and
Baptism is an action identifying us with Christ’s death and 

resurrection. <dr class="alt5">“Therefore we were buried with Him 

through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead 

by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of 

life” (Rom 3:4)</dr class="alt5">. </p>
<p>It does not save, but shows the 

world what has already happened in your life. <br>It is a public confession 

of faith.<br> It shows that you have died to your old sinful ways, and have 

put on the new man (or woman), which is righteous and holy:
<dr class="alt5">that you put off, concerning your former conduct, the 

old man which grows corrupt according to the deceitful lusts, and be 

renewed in the spirit of your mind, and that you put on the new man 

which was created according to God, in true righteousness and holiness. 

(Eph 4:22-24)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Baptism identifies with the death of Christ, but also with His 

resurrection.<br> They<dr class="alt5"> may have life, and that they may 

have it more abundantly. (John 10:10)</dr class="alt5">, full of joy and 

hope. Not only that, you are given the guarantee that as Christ 

resurrected Himself, He will also resurrect you some day. <dr 

class="alt5">“buried with Him in baptism, in which you also were raised 

with Him through faith in the working of God, who raised Him from the 

dead” (Col 2:12)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<h3>
Why you should be baptised
</h3>
<p>
Why should I be baptised? Jesus gave us the Great Commission:<dr 

class="alt5"> “Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, 

baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy 

Spirit,” (Matt 28:19)</dr class="alt5">. <br>Jesus told us to baptise 

the new believers, and He Himself set the example by being baptised. (Matt 3:13-17).</p> 
<p>When Jesus rose from the water,<dr class="alt5">... suddenly a voice 

came from heaven, saying, “This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well 

pleased.” (Matt 3:17)</dr class="alt5">.<br> Now don’t you want to please 

your Father who is in Heaven by being baptised, too? You should be 

baptised because Christ tells you to and because He set the example by 

being baptised Himself. If God the Father was “well pleased” when Christ 

was baptised, you should please Him by doing the same.</p>
<p>
“But since baptism is a work and I don’t have to do works to be saved, 

that doesn’t mean I have to do it, right?” We were saved <font 

size="+1">TO DO GOOD WORKS!!!</font> 
<br> (If you can’t get baptised because you are on your deathbed or have 

other physical limitations, don’t worry, you are still saved.)</p>
<h3>
Baptism is done by complete immersion in water only
</h3>
<p>
This is the only method found in the Bible, and therefore is the only 

legitimate one with God. The first proof is that people were travelling 

to bodies of water to be baptised. Now if they were baptising by 

sprinkling or pouring water on them, why would then have been travelling 

to bodies of water when they could have just used some water from their 

well or cistern? <br>John the Baptist was baptising in the Jordan River:
<dr class="alt5">and were baptised by him in the Jordan, confessing 

their sins. (Matt 3:6)</dr class="alt5">
</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p><dr class="alt5">Then all the land of Judea, and those from Jerusalem, went out to him 

and were all baptised by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.
(Mark 1:5)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
Jesus' baptism
</h3>
<p><dr class="alt5">
Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptised by John in the 

Jordan.(Mark 1:9)</dr class="alt5">.</p> 
<p>Jesus’ baptism was by immersion, because <dr class="alt5">“Jesus came up immediately from the water;” 

(Matt 3:16)</dr class="alt5">. He had been under the water.</p> 
<h3>
The Ethiopian eunuch's baptism
</h3>
<p> Philip had been expounding on the Scriptures and preaching Jesus to 

the Ethiopian eunuch.<dr class="alt5"> Now as they went down the road, 

they came to some water. And the eunuch said, “See, here is water. What 

hinders me from being baptised?” (Acts 8:36)</dr class="alt5">.      

<br><dr class="alt5"> What prevents me from being baptised? What must I do to be 

baptised?</dr class="alt5">

Then Philip said, <dr class="alt5">“If you believe with all your heart, you may.”</dr class="alt5"> The 

eunuch was not a believer. Lack of faith in Jesus Christ was hindering 

him from being baptised. When he made his public confession and said,<dr class="alt5"> “I 

believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God.” (Acts 8:37)</dr class="alt5"> he became a 

Christian, and Philip baptised him. <dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
What complete immersion symbolises
</h3>
<p>
Another reason why immersion is the only valid method is because it is 

the only one that portrays the death and resurrection of our Lord Jesus 

Christ. The submersion under the water symbolises both death and burial. 

<dr class="alt5">“Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into death 

...” (Rom 6:4)</dr class="alt5">.<br> Nothing about sprinkling or pouring 

symbolises death. Immersion also is the only one that portrays a 

resurrection from the dead. Just as Christ rose from the dead, you rise 

out of the water. <dr class="alt5">“buried with Him in baptism, in which 

you also were raised with Him through faith in the working of God, who 

raised Him from the dead” (Col 2:12).</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Baptism is for believers in Christ only. All baptisms recorded in the 

Bible were of those who had put their faith in Jesus Christ, not 

unbelievers or babies. (I’m talking about baptisms in the name of the 

Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, not the baptism of John the Baptist. More 

on this later.)</p>
<h3>
Being baptised <font size="+1">AFTER</font> salvation
</h3>
<p>
Here are more examples of people getting baptised <font size="+1">AFTER</font> salvation:<br>
<dr class="alt5">Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on 

the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing 

believed, and were baptised.<br> (Acts 18:8)</<dr class="alt5"></p>

<p>
So the Lord said to him, <dr class="alt5">“Arise and go to the street called Straight, 

and inquire at the house of Judas for one called Saul of Tarsus, for 

behold, he is praying.
And Ananias went his way and entered the house; and laying his hands on 

him he said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the 

road as you came, has sent me that you may receive your sight and be 

filled with the Holy Spirit.” Immediately there fell from his eyes 

something like scales, and he received his sight at once; and he arose 

and was baptised. (Acts 9:11,17-18)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
So they said, <dr class="alt5">“Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you will be saved, 

you and your household.” Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and 

to all who were in his house. And he took them the same hour of the 

night and washed their stripes. And immediately he and all his family 

were baptised.<br> (Acts 16:30-33)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
A baby cannot be a believer because he can’t old enough to understand 

the Gospel, and the Bible doesn’t mention anyone being baptised who was 

not already a Christian. <br>Baptism is for believers in Christ only.

Water baptism is very important for Christians. You need to be baptised 

in water. But it is not the only baptism that we need to know about. You 

also need to have the Baptism of the Holy Spirit and Baptism of 

Fire.</p>
<h3>
Baptism of the Holy Spirit
</h3>
<p>
Baptism of the Holy Spirit is a very necessary event in the life of the 

believer. It is when the believer is indwelled by the Holy Spirit of God 

. He gives the believer the POWER to abandon sin, follow God and be a 

witness for Christ. On the other hand, without Him you will struggle 

with sin, and be a poor witness. Baptism in the Holy Spirit can happen 

right at salvation, but this is not always true. You NEED the Baptism of 

the Holy Spirit!!</p>
<h3>
Life in the Holy Spirit
</h3>
<p>
Baptism in the Holy Spirit gives you the <font size="+1">POWER</font> to overcome sin, live a 

holy life, and become a <font size="+1">BOLD</font> witness for Christ. The Holy Spirit gives 

you the <font size="+1">BOLDNESS</font> to preach (or witness) without fear.
 <dr class="alt5">And when they had prayed, the place where they were 

assembled together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy 

Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.(Acts 4:31).</dr 

class="alt5"></p>
<p> Without Him, your preaching/witnessing is done from the weak flesh and 

will go nowhere. <font size="+1">YOU NEED THE BAPTISM OF THE HOLY 

SPIRIT</font>. <br>Jesus told His disciples after His resurrection to wait for the 

Holy Spirit before they started preaching. They couldn’t preach out of 

the flesh. Their flesh was too weak to stand up to the persecutions that 

would come. They needed the Holy Spirit for <font size="+1">BOLDNESS</font> and <font size="+1">COMFORT</font>.</p>
<p>
Preaching/ witnessing and just plain living without the Holy Spirit is 

powerless. Jesus said. <dr class="alt5">“without Me you can do nothing” 

(John 15:5)</dr class="alt5"> and He speaks to us thought the Holy 

Spirit. <dr class="alt5">However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has 

come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own 

authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you 

things to come. (John 16:13)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p> I have experienced some unanointed preachers first hand. I have also 

seen what anointed preaching is like. I know a pastor who’s never been 

to Bible school who can preach better than many I know who have, because 

he has the anointing of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p> Many were converted at the preaching of Barnabas. This was not 

because of his own doing but because <dr class="alt5">“he was a good 

man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith” (Acts 11:24)</dr 

class="alt5">. Barnabas’ preaching was<dr class="alt5"> “not in words 

which man’s wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches,” (1 Cor 

2:13)</dr class="alt5">, and because of this, people listened.<br> Paul 

wrote, <dr class="alt5">“For our gospel did not come to you in word 

only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit and in much assurance” 

(1 Thess. 1:5)</dr class="alt5">. They weren’t preaching using man’s 

wisdom; they were preaching using the Holy Spirit of God. The Holy 

Spirit was guiding their preaching</p>
<p>
The Holy Spirit gives you your spiritual gifts/ anointing (Heb. 2:4), 

and He helps you carry them out. Just as witnessing is dead if not done 

through the Holy Spirit, so are your gifts if you do not do them with 

His guidance. He will make you very fruitful in Christ if you patiently 

work through Him. He will help you perform your spiritual gifts and 

God’s will for your life.</p>
<p>
The Holy Spirit gives you the<font size="+1"> POWER</font> to abandon your sin, and live 

righteously. He is the <font size="+1"> POWER</font> that God gives us. You <font size="+1">CANNOT</font> turn from 

your sin yourself, your own human nature, your carnal desires, will keep 

you sinning. You cannot fight sin with the flesh because sin is in your 

flesh. There is nothing good in your flesh, only evil. Paul wrote,<dr 

class="alt5"> “For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good 

dwells(Rom 7:18)</dr class="alt5">. There is nothing good in your flesh. 

If you try to fight sin without the Spirit of God, you will fail.</p>
<p>
The Holy Spirit will give you the <font size="+1"> POWER</font> to whip all the sin in your 

life, and He will then turn you into a holy witness for Christ. Yes, you 

<font size="+1">CAN BE HOLY</font>. But you have to let Him do His work in you.<br> If there is 

some favourite sin that you don’t want to get rid of, do not expect God 

to fill you with His Holy Spirit. God will only give His Holy Spirit to 

those who will <font size="+1">OBEY HIM</font>: <dr class="alt5">“And we are His witnesses to 

these things, and so also is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those 

who obey Him” (Acts 5:32)</dr class="alt5">.<br> Do not expect God to fill 

you with His Spirit if you are a carnal Christian.</p>
<p>
The Holy Spirit is your guide in worship. We are to worship God in 

<font size="+1">SPIRIT</font> and in <font size="+1">TRUTH</font>. You cannot worship in Spirit without Him. <dr 

class="alt5"> But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true 

worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth; for the Father 

is seeking such to worship Him. God is Spirit, and those who worship Him 

must worship in spirit and truth.” (John 4:23-24)</dr class="alt5">.</p> 
<p>
He is also your guide to the Word of God. He will show you things out of 

the Bible that you will <font size="+1">NEVER</font> find with your own understanding:
<dr class="alt5">
But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, 

He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things 

that I said to you. (John 14:26)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into 

all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He 

hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come. He will 

glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you. 

(John 16:13-14)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
The Holy Spirit is your Comforter in times of trouble.<dr class="alt5"> 

Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer 

persecution. (2 Tim 3:12)</dr class="alt5">. He will help you live 

godly, and He will help you endure the persecution that comes with it.<br> 

You cannot endure the trials and persecutions of this life without the 

Holy Spirit helping you. You will fail miserably on your own. <dr 

class="alt5">“for without Me you can do nothing” (John 15:5)</dr 

class="alt5">.</p>
<h3>
How to get the Baptism of the Holy Ghost
</h3>
<p>
Baptism of the Holy Spirit is very needed in the Christian life. But how 

do you get it? Baptism of the Holy Spirit can happen at salvation, but 

this is not always the case. Acts 19 describes converts who had just 

been saved, and baptised in water, but didn’t have the Holy Spirit. <br>
 So Paul laid his hands on them:
<dr class="alt5">
When they heard this, they were baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus. 

And when Paul had laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, 

and they spoke with tongues and prophesied (Acts 19:5-6)</dr 

class="alt5"></p>
<p>
In Acts Chapter 8, many Samaritans received Christ and were baptised in 

His name (water baptism). These too were saved and baptised but did not have the Holy 

Spirit.<br> 

<dr class="alt5"> Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that 

Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them, 

who, when they had come down, prayed for them that they might receive 

the Holy Spirit. For as yet He had fallen upon none of them. They had 

only been baptised in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then they laid 

hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. <br
>(Acts 8:14-17)</dr 

class="alt5"></p>
<p>
These are two examples of people who received the Holy Spirit sometime 

<font size="+1">AFTER</font> salvation and water baptism. Not everyone receives the Holy Spirit 

at salvation. Ignore false teaching that the Holy Spirit <font size="+1">ALWAYS</font> comes at 

salvation (Taught by many fundamentalists). Since not everyone 

receives the Holy Spirit at salvation, the following will show you how 

to get the Baptism of the Holy Spirit:</p>

<p>God gives the Holy Spirit to them that <font size="+1">ASK</font> Him and <font size="+1">OBEY</font> Him:<dr 

class="alt5"> “If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to 

your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy 

Spirit to those who ask Him!” (Luke 11:13)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p><dr class="alt5"> 
“And we are His witnesses to these things, and so also 

is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey Him.” (Acts 

5:32)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p> God will <font size="+1">NOT</font> give you the Holy Spirit if you will not obey Him. You 

must be willing to abandon this world and it’s system, and trust and 

obey God. You must be willing to allow Him to purge <font size="+1">EVERY</font> sin from your 

life. If this means throwing out all your CD’s, videos, and books, then 

so be it. You must be committed to become holy at all costs. You can’t 

become holy without having the Holy Spirit, and God will not give you 

the Holy Spirit if you are not willing to become holy. And if you don’t 

want to be holy, you are disobeying God Who said,  <dr class="alt5">“Be 

holy, for I am holy.” (1 Peter 1:16)</dr class="alt5">. And if you are 

not obeying God, He <font size="+1">WILL NOT</font> give you His Holy Spirit. You must be 

willing to follow Christ <font size="+1">AT ALL COSTS</font>.</p>
<p>
Ask your pastor or another male church leader to lay hands on you and 

pray for the Holy Spirit. This is how many people in the early church 

received Him. If this doesn’t work, perhaps you are not ready to 

surrender all.</p>
<p>
Ask God in prayer for the Holy Spirit and wait. If you do not get Him 

right away, keep asking, and do some soul searching. Are their any sins 

that you are stubbornly hanging on to, that you want to keep? Are there 

any sins that you are not aware of? Characteristics of the Self-life 

will help you do soul searching and find hidden sins.</p>
<p>
Note that when you receive the Holy Spirit, you may or may not speak in 

tongues. Beware false teaching by charismatics that speaking in tongues 

is the evidence for receiving the Holy Spirit, and that if you don’t 

speak in tongues, you don’t have Him. Speaking in tongues is a spiritual 

gift, and like other spiritual gifts, not everyone gets the same gift 

(See 1 Cor 12 and 14).</p>
<p>
The Baptism of the Holy Spirit is very important. When you are filled 

with the Holy Spirit, He will lead you in all truth and away from all 

sin. You need to be filled with the Spirit to live the Christian life. 

If you don’t have the Baptism of the Holy Spirit, you should ask God for 

it, because not everyone gets it at salvation.</p>
<h3>
Baptism of Fire
</h3>
<p>
The Baptism of Fire is the holy purgation given to you by the Holy 

Spirit.<dr class="alt5"> I [John the Baptist] indeed baptise you with 

water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, 

whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptise you with the 

Holy Spirit and fire. (Matt 3:11)</dr class="alt5">. </p>
<p>This is the Holy Spirit’s work of purging you of <font size="+1">ALL</font> of your sins, 

referred to in the Bible as <font size="+1">SANCTIFICATION</font>. Sanctification is the 

processes of making you <font size="+1">HOLY</font>. Although it starts at salvation with the 

elimination of your MAJOR sins, it doesn’t get your hidden ones until 

you receive the Baptism of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p> Once you start bearing 

spiritual fruit, He will purge you so that you will bear <font size="+1">MORE FRUIT</font>.  

<dr class="alt5">Every branch in Me that does not bear fruit He takes 

away; and every branch that bears fruit He prunes, that it may bear more 

fruit.”<br> (John 15:2)</dr class="alt5">.<br> If you are willing to let Him 

purge you at any cost, you will bring forth much fruit. It will be 

quality fruit that can withstand God’s test of fire: <dr class="alt5"> 

each one’s work will become clear; for the Day will declare it, because 

it will be revealed by fire; and the fire will test each one’s work, of 

what sort it is. (1Cor 3:13)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Baptism of Fire also refers to the persecution that all Christians will 

face. Your faith will be tried by <font size="+1">FIRE</font> <dr class="alt5">that the 

genuineness of your faith, being much more precious than gold that 

perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honour, 

and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ,(1 Pet 1:7)<dr 

class="alt5">.</p>
<p><dr class="alt5"> Yes, and all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus 

will suffer persecution. <br>(2 Tim 3:12)<dr class="alt5"></p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
 Beloved, do not think it strange concerning the fiery trial which is to 

try you, as though some strange thing happened to you; 13 but rejoice to 

the extent that you partake of Christ’s sufferings, that when His glory 

is revealed, you may also be glad with exceeding joy. (1 Peter 4:12-

13)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
The persecution will divide between the sheep and the goats, for the 

goats will not be able to stand the heat, thus purging the church of the 

fake Christians.<br> It will either strengthen your faith in Christ, or show 

that you never had faith. The persecutions of the Apostle Paul lead the 

other Christians to be more <font size="+1">BOLD</font> to speak the word <font size="+1">WITHOUT FEAR</font>:<dr 

class="alt5"> “... and most of the brethren in the Lord, having become 

confident by my chains, are much more bold to speak the word without 

fear.” (Phil 1:14)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
The Baptism of Fire is the act of the Holy Spirit to purge you of ALL 

your sins, including ones you don’t even know about, and make you pure, 

holy, separate from this world, and set apart for God.</p>
<h3>
Baptism of John the Baptist
</h3>
<p>
The baptism of John the Baptist, also known as the baptism of John, is 

obsolete. John baptised<dr class="alt5"> with water unto repentance 

(Matt 3:11)</dr class="alt5">. He baptised those who were repenting of 

their sins to prepare them for the Lamb of God that was coming. These 

were not saved, but were made ready to accept Jesus Christ when He came. 

John the Baptist was the forerunner of Christ, sent to prepare His way. 

<br>His baptism was the predecessor of baptism in the name of the Trinity. <br>

Acts chapters 18 and 19 tells of people who were preaching only John’s 

baptism, and had to be corrected by the Christians.</p>
<p>

<dr class="alt5">
Now a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man and 

mighty in the Scriptures, came to Ephesus. This man had been 

instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke 

and taught accurately the things of the Lord, though he knew only the 

baptism of John. So he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. When 

Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him aside and explained to him 

the way of God more accurately. And when he desired to cross to 

Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him; and 

when he arrived, he greatly helped those who had believed through grace; 

 for he vigorously refuted the Jews publicly, showing from the 

Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ. (Acts 18:24-28)</dr class="alt5"></p>

<p><dr class="alt5">
And it happened, while Apollos was at Corinth, that Paul, having passed 

through the upper regions, came to Ephesus. And finding some disciples 

he said to them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?”
So they said to him, “We have not so much as heard whether there is a 

Holy Spirit.” And he said to them, “Into what then were you baptised?”
So they said, “Into John’s baptism.” Then Paul said, “John indeed 

baptised with a baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they 

should believe on Him who would come after him, that is, on Christ 

Jesus.” When they heard this, they were baptised in the name of the Lord 

Jesus. (Acts 19:1-5)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>

Note that these had received John’s baptism, but when they were preached 

Christ, they received the baptism in the name of the Trinity. So John’s 

baptism was only the forerunner of the baptism of the Trinity, and is of 

no use today.</p>
