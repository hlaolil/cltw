The Divine Pattern
</h1>
<h3>
Death
</h3>
<p>
Since the penalty for sin was death (Gen. 2:17; Rom. 6:23), it was necessary that Jesus Himself die to bear our penalty. His death was similar to ours, and is the pattern for us. Jesus' physical body died (Matt. 27:50), and His human spirit (or soul) was separated from His body and passed into the presence of the Father in heaven (Luke 23:43, 46). Thus, He experienced a death that is like the one we as believers will experience if we die in this present age.<br> The knowledge that Jesus has gone through death before us should remove from us the fear of death. (I Cor. 15:55-57; Heb. 2:14-15)</p>
<p>
It is not correct to say that Jesus' divine nature died, or could die, if "die" implies a cessation of activity, a cessation of consciousness, or a diminution of power (John 2:19; 10:17-18). Yet by virtue of union with Jesus' human nature, His divine nature experienced what it was like to go through death. Whether the divine nature was ever itself the object of divine wrath against sin is not explicitly stated in Scripture. </p>
<h3>
Burial
</h3>
<p>
Jesus' body was laid in a tomb (Matt. 27:59-60), and He continued under the state of death for a time. Thus, Jesus' humiliation was complete in that He suffered all the punishment and shame due to fallen mankind as a result of sin.</p>
<h3>
The Resurrection
</h3>
<p>
The resurrection was the transition point into Jesus' state of exaltation. It was the person of Christ that was exalted, not just His human nature, but the focus of this activity of exaltation was the change in His human nature to a new, much more glorious state.
The resurrection was not just a restoration to life, but the beginning of a new, better kind of life, a "resurrection life" (Rom. 6:9-10).<br> After the resurrection, Jesus still had a physical body that could be touched and held (Matt. 28:9; John 20:17, 27), could break bread (Luke 24:30), prepare breakfast (John 21:12-13), and eat (Luke 24:42-43). It was a body of "flesh and bones," for Jesus said,<dr class="alt5"> "A spirit has not flesh and bones as you see I have". <br>(Luke 24:39)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Yet this physical body of Jesus was no longer subject to weakness, sickness, ageing, or death.<br> It was imperishable and glorious and powerful (I Cor. 15:42-44; the term "spiritual" here means not "non material" but "conformed to the character of the Holy Spirit"). It is possible that John 20:19 implies that Jesus had the ability to enter a locked room miraculously. It is clear, however, that since Jesus was the "first fruits" of the resurrection, we will be like Him when we are raised from the dead. (I Cor. 15:20, 23, 49; Phil. 3:21; I John 3:2)</p>
<p>
The resurrection demonstrated the approval of God the Father and His satisfaction with Christ's work of redemption (Isa. 53:11; Phil. 2:8-9). Now Christ was exalted to a new status with respect to the law as well: He was no longer under the law in the sense of being obligated to obey the OT as our representative, for His work of obedience in our place was complete<br> (Rom. 5:18-19).</p>
<p>
The resurrection also was the initiation of a new relationship with God the Father, for Jesus was exalted to the role of messianic "Son" with new power and authority which were not His before as God-man.<br> (Matt. 28:18; Acts 13:33; Rom. 1:4; Heb. 1:5)
