<h1>
Eternal Judgement
</h1>
<p>
This subject is the same as any subject in the Bible, in that it requires some rightly dividing, if we are to properly understand it. Because we have a tendency to equate the word judgement with punishment, when Paul says, "Eternal judgement," our minds hear "eternal punishment." As a result, we tend to miss the fact that many who come before the throne of God’s judgement will be judged worthy of eternal life and other exceeding great rewards. Punishment and damnation will be meted out, but that is by no means all that is implied here. Therefore we must first deal somewhat with the title of the subject.</p>
<p>
The judgement to which Paul refers is more clearly understood by his statement in 2 Cor 5. <dr class="alt5">"we must all appear before the judgement seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad." (2 Cor 5:10)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Likewise, the word eternal is somewhat misleading. It should be understood more in the sense in which it is used in Jude 6 and 7. He said, the angels that fell with Lucifer are <dr class="alt5">"reserved in everlasting chains under darkness for the judgement of the great day;." </dr class="alt5"> Sodom and Gomorrah also suffered <dr class="alt5">"the vengeance of eternal fire." (Jude 1:6-7)</dr class="alt5"> That fire is apparently not still burning.</p>
<p>
Jonah said <dr class="alt5">"The earth with its bars closed behind me forever;" (Jonah 2:6)</dr class="alt5"> The reader must hear the words "until the resurrection." This doctrine, indeed, concerns what I sometimes call "the Age of judgement." The age of judgement begins with the judgement of The Church during the two periods of its operation, both in the first century A.D., and in this "last time." It ends with The judgement of the Great Day. (Jude 6; 1 Pet. 4:17)</p>
<p>
There are four major phases of the Age of judgement. They are:<br> 
1) The judgement of The Elect, 
2) The judgement of The Other Saints, 
3) The judgement of The Nations, and 
4) The judgement of The Great Day.<br> 
God will not judge the nations until He has judged the believers. That judgement partly involves a period of persecution. 1 Peter 4, shows that the persecution will serve, partly to purify the righteous, <dr class="alt5"> "he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin," (1 Pet. 4:1)</dr class="alt5"> Jesus said, in Luke 11:49-51, that it would also serve to justify God in pouring out His wrath upon the ungodly.</p>
<h3>
The judgement of The Elect
</h3>
In 1 Peter 4:17, the Apostle Peter announced the beginning of judgement among The Elect in his day. Indeed, very harsh judgement was executed upon two members of The Church, Ananias and Sapphira, who laid an unholy offering upon that holy altar of twelve Apostles. In Heb. 13:10, God told us that there was an altar in that New Testament temple, and Ex 20:25 and 1 Kings 18:31-32, show the New Testament altar to be the twelve apostles. (Ex 29:37; Acts 4:34 to Acts 5:11 and 1 Peter 2:5)</p>
<p>
Other Christians knew that such harsh punishment was associated with Peter and that Church, and they would not join that organisation. As it is written,<dr class="alt5"> "Yet none of the rest dared join them, but the people esteemed them highly. And believers were increasingly added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women," (Acts 5:11-14)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
God's immediate judgement of the elect is also seen in 1 Cor 11:20-31. Paul told us that many members of the body had become sick, and many had died, because they ate and drank the Passover (Actually the Lord’s Supper) unworthily, <dr class="alt5">"not discerning the Lord’s body."</dr class="alt5"> However, he countered with the words, <dr class="alt5">"For if we would judge ourselves, we would not be judged."</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
The apostle Paul also showed the distinction between the judgement of The Elect and that of other Christians, from the standpoint of the authority which Jesus gave them when He left.<br>

(Mark 13:34) The Elect have the authority, and the responsibility, to pass judgement about who may, or may not, be part of their work and reward. (John 20:23; Matt 18:15-20) No mortal man can possibly determine whose name is written in the Book of Life, or the Book of Life of The Lamb. Therefore, we know that God is speaking about whoever’s name shall be entered in, or blotted out of, the Book of The Holy City. (Rev 22:19; Heb 12:22-24)</p>
<p>
We see, therefore, that the judgement of God’s Church, as concerns bringing it to perfection, is given to the members themselves. This is fact is shown in 1 Cor 5. He told them not to eat the Passover with a member who was known to be unworthy, because of some sin of the flesh. He instructed them to turn that wicked person out of The Church, so that the "Spirit of The Church" might be saved. (Eph 4:4; Rev 1:20; Rev 2:1-5) He said, <dr class="alt5">"do not even to eat with such a person. For what have I to do with judging those also who are outside? Do you not judge those who are inside? But those who are outside God judges. Therefore “put away from yourselves the evil person.” (1 Cor 5:12,13)</dr class="alt5">;(Matt 18:15-20) However, he cautions us that the authority to judge bears with it the requirement that the people who execute that judgement must be blameless, <dr class="alt5">"and being ready to punish all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled." (2 Cor 10:6)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
The works of the flesh are to the body of Christ what a terminal illness is to the human body. The Church was the "new man," of Eph 2:14-15, and, as such, could die, if something contrary to its spirit was allowed to remain in it. The words of Prov 20:27 and James 2:26 apply to this "new man" the same as they do the us humans.</p>
<p>
When The Church is in existence, the authority to bind and loose is inherent in it at all times, but God seems to execute immediate punishments only during certain predestined periods of time. As in the case of Ananias and Sapphira, The Church fulfilled the prophetic intent of the feast of unleavened bread. During its first seven years The Church was without leaven. During that time, or shortly thereafter, the leaven of covetousness cost Ananias and Sapphira their lives. (Ex 12:14,15) They inherited the curse of Heb 6:1-8, Lev 15:31, and 1 Cor 3:16,17.</p>
<p>
Not only were severe punishments meted out, but specific rewards were promised to some. For example, in Matt 19, Jesus told His twelve apostles exactly what their rewards will be during His ruler ship of the world for a thousand years. He told them, <dr class="alt5">"I say to you, that in the regeneration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory, you who have followed Me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel." (Matt 19:28)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
When Jesus comes, the saints will judge the world. Therefore, The Elect must be judged before He comes. (1 Cor 6:2; Rev 2:26,27) We are now approaching the second fulfilment of the feast of unleavened bread; at which time God will conclude the judgement of The Elect. (2 Chron 30:20-27) At that time it shall be determined who shall sit upon those other twelve thrones which are foreshadowed in Rev 4:4.</p>
<p>
The Bride the Lamb's Wife must now awake from her sleep, and conclude the judgement of The Elect, so our Lord can come for His glorious church. (Isa 52:1,2; Eph 5:14,25-32)</p>
<h3>
The judgement of The Other Saints
</h3>
<p>
Once The Elect have been judged, God will then begin to judge the other believers. 
They are the guests at the marriage of the king's son <dr class="alt5">"both bad and good". (Matt 22:2-10)</dr class="alt5"> 
They are the ten virgins, <dr class="alt5">"five of them were wise, and five were foolish." of Matt 25:1-13</dr class="alt5">.
They are <dr class="alt5">"multitudes of both men and women," (Acts 5:1-14)<dr class="alt5">. 
They are <dr class="alt5">"a great multitude which no one could number, of all nations, tribes, peoples, and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, with palm branches in their hands," (Rev. 7:9)</dr class="alt5">; (John 12:12,13)</p>
<p>
Their judgement is partially expressed by Jesus in Luke 12:32-48. He said, <dr class="alt5">"that servant who knew his master’s will, and did not prepare himself or do according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. But he who did not know, yet committed things deserving of stripes, shall be beaten with few. For everyone to whom much is given, from him much will be required;" (Luke 12:32-48)</dr class="alt5"> I believe that the persecution during the time of the prophecy of the two witnesses, in Rev. 11, relates to that judgement.</p>
<h3>
The judgement of The Nations
</h3>
<p>
God said to Jesus in the second Psalm, <dr class="alt5">"Ask of Me, and I will give You
the nations for Your inheritance,and the ends of the earth for Your possession. You shall break them with a rod of iron; You shall dash them to pieces like a potter’s vessel." (Psa 2:8-9)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
The world hated Jesus and killed Him, <dr class="alt5">"But this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God, from that time waiting till His enemies are made His footstool." (Heb 10:12-13; Psa 110:1)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
"Now Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied about these men also, saying, “Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement on all, to convict all who are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have committed in an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things which ungodly sinners have spoken against Him." (Jude 14-15)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
This judging of the nations is prophesied of in Dan. 7:9-12, and again in Matt. 25:31-46. Before we consider these passages we need to understand the words of Jesus in John 5. <dr class="alt5">"For the Father judges no one, but has committed all judgement to the Son,that all should honour the Son just as they honour the Father." (John 5:22,23)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Also, in Dan 4, we see that <dr class="alt5">"the Most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomever He chooses." (Dan 4:25)</dr class="alt5"> Apparently it is Jesus who shall "sit," and not the Father. The earth has always been under God’s control, else how could He give it to Jesus.</p>
<p>
Now hear Dan 7.<dr class="alt5"> "I watched till thrones were put in place, and the Ancient of Days was seated; His garment was white as snow, and the hair of His head was like pure wool: His throne was a fiery flame, its wheels a burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before Him. A thousand thousands ministered to Him; ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him. The court was seated and the books were opened. I watched then because of the  pompous words which the horn was speaking; I watched till the beast was slain, and its body destroyed, and given to the burning flame. As for the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time." (Dan 7:9-12) </dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Jesus further enlightens us in Matt 25.<dr class="alt5"> "When the Son of Man  comes in His glory, and all the holy angels with Him, then He will sit upon the throne of His glory: All the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them one from another. ..." Then the King will say to those on His right hand, ‘Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world ..." Then He will also say to those on the left hand, "Depart from Me, you cursed, into the everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels:" (Matt 25:31-41)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
That these are nations, and not individuals, is evident from their replies. Some said, When did we ever do anything for you? A Christian would never ask such a question. No, the ones on the right hand are not Christians, but rather, nations which have treated Christians well.</p>
<p>
Those on His right hand continue for a time, but eventually Jesus and those with Him, some of whom are mentioned in Rev 2:26,27 and Rev 20:1-4, shall conquer the whole world and establish new national boundaries dictated by Deut 32:8. There shall then be twelve nations on earth, and Jesus shall sit, the King of Kings. <dr class="alt5">"Then comes the end, when He delivers the kingdom to God the Father, when He puts an end to all rule and all authority and power.  For He must reign till He has put all enemies under His feet." (1 Cor 15:24,25)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
The judgement Of The Great Day
</h3>
<p><dr class="alt5">
" And the angels who did not keep their proper domain, but left their own abode, He has reserved in everlasting chains under darkness for the judgement of the great day;" (Jude 1:6)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
There is a revelation hidden in the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles, the eighth day of which is called "the great day." (John 7:2,37; Lev. 23:34-36) The seventh day (millennium) is "The Lord's Day," but the Feast of Tabernacles reveals the eighth millennium as "The Great Day." At that time Jesus will judge the rest of mankind. He will resurrect all of the dead who did not arise in the first resurrection, He will then judge them, as well as Satan and the angels which fell with him. (Rev. 20:5-15) At that time some of those, who had part in the first resurrection and the change, shall sit, together with Jesus, and experience the words of Paul, who said,<dr class="alt5"> "Do you not know that we shall judge angels?" (1 Cor. 6:3)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
When Jesus accomplishes the first resurrection, rewards will be given to the saints. At that time, Jesus will convey the reward, which He mentioned in Matt 8, <dr class="alt5">many will come from east and west, and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. (Matt 8:11)</dr class="alt5"> He will reward the elect, living and dead, as well as the other believers which are <dr class="alt5">"alive and remain until the coming of the Lord". (1 Thess 4:15)</dr class="alt5"> At that time the twelve Jewish Apostles shall become the Priests of the Earth (Matt 19:28), and the twelve Gentile Apostles shall become the kings of the earth (Isa 60:10), and so forth. (1 Cor 6:2; 1 Tim 4:7-8 and 2 Peter 1:11)</p>
<p>
At the end of the seventh millennium, at the judgement of The Great Day, Jesus will conclude His mission of "judgement upon all." The remainder of all of the people who have ever lived shall stand before God’s great throne of judgement and give account of themselves, and be judged of their words and deeds in this life. (Jude 1-15) Then God shall "render to every man according to his deeds."</p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
"the hour is coming in which all who are in the graves will hear His voice 29 and come forth—those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of condemnation." (John 5:28-29)</dr class="alt5"> This latter resurrection will occur some time after the seventh millennium has ended. For God said, <dr class="alt5">"The rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years were finished. When the thousand years have expired, Satan will be released from his prison, and shall go out to deceive the nations, to gather them together to battle." (Rev 20:5-8)</dr class="alt5"> Satan obviously cannot accomplish that in a few days.</p>
<p>
Once carnal man shall have proven his proclivity to follow after evil, this last time, and Satan shall have finished his work, Jesus will execute the final judgement. For after living under the auspices of Jesus’ righteous and benevolent rule, the world shall again choose the wicked one, and justify God’s wrath upon them.</p>
<p>
In that resurrection, those whose names are written in The Book of Life, will inherit life. At that time, <dr class="alt5">"as many as have sinned without law will also perish without law: and as many as have sinned in the law will be judged by the law. In the day when God will judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ." (Rom 2:8-16)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<>
The Apostle John <dr class="alt5">"saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which was The Book of Life. And anyone not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the lake of fire." (Rev 20:12,15)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Then shall be fulfilled that saying, "But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a great noise, and the elements will melt with fervent heat; both the earth and the works that are in it will be burned up. Therefore, since all these things will be dissolved, what manner of persons ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness, looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be dissolved, being on fire, and the elements will melt with fervent heat?  Nevertheless we, according to His promise, look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells." (2 Pet. 3:10-13)</p>
