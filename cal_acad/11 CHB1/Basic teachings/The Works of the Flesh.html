   <h1>
The Works of the Flesh
</h1>
<h2>
Two possible ways of life
</h2>
<p>
There are two possible ways of life set forth in the last portion 

of Galatians 5. The one is lived in the flesh (with its wicked 

deeds manifested in verses 19-21). The other brings forth the fruit 

of the Spirit (producing the beautiful Christian characteristics 

described in verses 22-23).</p>
<p>
As offspring of Adam we inherit the flesh nature, but as sons of 

God we are given a new life (and nature) which is subject to the 

Holy Spirit. It is the inborn flesh nature that urges us to give in 

to evil deeds. By way of contrast, it is the Spirit living within 

who produces good fruit. The Christian conflict is described in 

Galatians 5.<dr class="alt5"> “I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and 

you shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusts 

against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are 

contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you 

wish. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.” 

(Gal 5:16-18)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
The flesh nature (the sin nature with which we were born), 

controlled us before we were saved. When we believed on the Lord 

Jesus Christ, and met the conditions of salvation the Holy Spirit 

imparted to us a new nature (the nature of God), and now we have 

two natures. The old nature has not been eliminated, nor has it 

been changed. Both natures (the old and the new) dwell side by side 

within us, and so we need to deliberately walk in the Spirit (Gal 

5:16) that we don't <dr class="alt5">“fulfil the lust of the flesh.”</dr class="alt5"> The word 

“walk” in the original Greek is in the present tense. and speaks of 

a regular, continuous action.</p>
<p>
The word “walk” means “to advance by steps,” but here it is used 

figuratively, meaning to conduct ourselves day by day in accord 

with the directives of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>
The two natures are contrary to one another. They stand in 

opposition to each other and work against each other (Gal 5:17). 

This is the reason for the inner conflict which every Christian 

experiences. All of us sense a civil war within. All people 

experience a measure of moral conflict within, but Christians find 

the conflict within is even more fierce than it was in our unsaved 

days.<br> Satan works hard because he doesn't want to lose our loyalty 

to him. However, as we learn to walk in the Spirit, the flesh 

becomes increasingly subdued. The Holy Spirit has been given to 

enable us to gain the victory over enslavement to sin.<br> Paul 

describes the struggle more fully in Romans 7:7-25. and tells about 

the victory in Romans 8:5-9.
Only when one is born of the Spirit, and is yielded to the Spirit's 

leading, will the individual become victorious over the pull of the 

flesh nature (Gal 5:18). A holy life is never achieved by our own 

efforts through our own strength. It is produced as we yield to the 

leading of the indwelling Holy Spirit.
The works of the flesh are described in Galatians 5.<dr class="alt5"><br> “Now the works 

of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, 

uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, 

jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, 

heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of 

which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, 

that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of 

God” (Gal 5:19-21)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Paul gives us a list of the works of the flesh. No person can be 

better outwardly than he is inwardly. He may be able to hide his 

evil desires for a season, but eventually they will become manifest 

or evident (Gal 5:19).
We note too that Paul's list of fleshly works is not complete.<br> The 

list is rather comprehensive, but it is concluded with the words 

“and the like” (Gal 5:21). The list of fleshly works includes deeds 

of impurity, sins of idolatry, sins of hostility, and sins of 

intemperance - but there are other “works of the flesh.”</p>
<h2>
1. Sins of Impurity
</h2>
<p>
The sins of impurity include adultery, fornication, uncleanness, 

and lewdness. These are works of the flesh. There is no room for 

compromise. Immorality shall have no place in the Christian life. 

William Barclay says that every imaginable form of immorality was 

commonly and openly practised in New Testament times by rulers, 

philosophers, poets, priests, and many common people with no sense 

of shame or remorse. It was the accepted way of life in the ancient 

world.</p>
<h3>
Adultery
</h3>
<p>
Adultery speaks of illicit sex relations on the part of those who 

are married. Leviticus 18 spells it out plainly: <br><dr 

class="alt5">“Moreover you shall not lie carnally with your 

neighbour's wife, to defile yourself with her.” (Lev 18:20)</dr 

class="alt5"><br>
Hebrews 13 says <dr class="alt5">"fornicators and adulterers God 

will judge.” (Heb 13:4)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
There are various forms of adultery. These include the physical 

adultery (described in Lev 18:20), the mental adultery (which 

involves fantasising, or saturating the mind with illicit 

thoughts), and legalised adultery (which includes the remarriage of 

one who is divorced, when the original partner is still living). 

And then there is a plan which can be called communal adultery 

(where men and women live in a community arrangement that allows 

freedom for anyone to sleep with any other person).<br>
When God established the home He designed that one man should live 

with one woman, and the two should become one flesh. The sin of 

adultery is not a trivial matter.</p>
<h3>
Fornication
</h3>
<p>
Fornication speaks of illicit sexual relations among the unmarried. 

A recent issue of U.S. News & World Report indicates that ten 

percent of all girls in the United States have had sexual 

intercourse by the age of 13.<br> Couples that live together like 

husband and wife before marriage are living in fornication.<br> As a 

result of the rampant sexual impurity, hundreds of teenage youth 

are being infected with venereal diseases every day.</p>
<h3>
Uncleanness
</h3>
<p>
Uncleanness describes those who may not necessarily commit outward 

acts of immorality, but whose thoughts and desires are unclean. 

Uncleanness is stimulated by reading pornographic literature, 

dwelling on obscene pictures, and telling smutty suggestive 

stories. It is aggravated further by the present-day emphasis on 

wearing less and less and exposing more and more.</p>
<h3>
Lasciviousness
</h3>
<p>
Lasciviousness speaks of uncontrolled lust. Individuals can be 

guilty of uncleanness, but when they become lascivious, they become 

so immoral that they shock public decency by their conduct. One who 

becomes lascivious has gone so far into impurity that he no longer 

cares what God or what man thinks about his actions.
These have been sins of impurity.<br> Satan is a vicious liar. He has 

been trying over the years to stir wrong sexual desires by implying 

that secret adulterous love is more exciting than true married 

love. The moral depravity that is sweeping the world is a cause for 

concern. Sexual misconduct deeply grieves the Holy Spirit (I 

Cor 6:18-20).
<h2>
2. Sins of Idolatry
</h2>
<p>
The “works of the flesh” include a second category which we have 

labeled sins of idolatry. These include one evil called “idolatry” 

and another called “witchcraft” (sorcery).
<h3>
Idolatry
</h3>
<p>
Idolatry is the act of giving something other than the true and 

living God, the principal place in our affections. Most people in 

our society do not worship gods of wood and stone, but it is easy 

for us to set our affections on gods of chrome and steel and glass. 

Some worship the gods of pleasure and fashion and material things. 

Shopping malls are the cathedrals where multitudes are worshipping 

in recent times.</p>
<p> 
Multitudes plan and scheme for the future like the man in the 

parable that Jesus told in Luke 12:16-21. The man was prospering 

financially more and more each year. His barns were full. He was a 

good man; he was an outstanding farmer; but he was preoccupied with 

material things. While he was still in the midst of his plans for 

the future, God said to him,<dr class="alt5"> 
"Fool! This night your soul will be required of you; then whose 

will those things be which you have provided?" <br
>(Luke 12:20).</dr 

class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
Witchcraft
</h3>
<p>
Witchcraft is translated from the Greek word pharmakeia, which 

refers to “the use of drugs.” Today, the word “witchcraft” (or 

“sorcery”) refers to those who claim to have superhuman powers, 

abilities to cause spells, to use magic, and to attain secret 

knowledge gleaned from evil spirits.<br> These practices were 

widespread in the pagan cultures, but Israel was prohibited from 

allowing sorcerers, spiritualists, mediums, necromancers, and the like 

in their midst. In ancient times drugs were used for a variety of 

purposes, but especially for abortion.<br>
Many colleges are now offering courses on witchcraft. Superstition 

is closely related to witchcraft. Some carry a rabbit's foot, hang 

a horseshoe above the barn door, cross their fingers when making a 

decision, or spit when a black cat crosses their path. Believers 

who have to trust in luck instead of consulting God in prayer, are 

guilty of minding the things of the flesh.<br>
The popular Harry Potter books place an emphasis on witchcraft. A 

letter recorded in the August 19, 2000 issue of the World magazine 

expresses dismay at the content of the Potter books. The writer 

says. "Witchcraft was a part of my life before Christ stepped into 

my life. [Witchcraft] is not a laughing matter, nor is it child 

play.” We are not to dabble with occult practices including 

fortune-telling and witchcraft.</p>
<h2>
3. Sins of Hostility
</h2>
<p>
There is a third category of works of the flesh which we have 

labelled “sins of hostility.” Many of the sins of hostility are 

closely related, and so there will be only a brief description of 

each expression of animosity.</p>
<h3>
Hatred
</h3>
<p>
Hatred is a strong dislike (a feeling of ill-will) toward another 

person.<br> The apostle John declares,<dr class="alt5"> “Whoever hates 

his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has 

eternal life abiding in him.” (I John 3:15).</dr class="alt5"> <br>For 

some, hatred is a way of life. Such persons are essentially 

murderers even though they may never have committed the overt act 

of murder. We must always be careful to use the word “hatred” only 

for hating a wrong cause (like intolerance and injustice), not for 

hating individual persons.</p>
<h3>
Variance
</h3>
<p>
Variance speaks of disputes and quarrels that cause discord among 

brethren. There are too many church members who are simply not easy 

to get along with. Many are dreadful1y touchy and easily offended. 

Some are stubborn and bull-headed, and just plain contrary. May the 

Lord deliver all of us from these carnal and wicked 

characteristics!</p>
<h3>
Jealous rivalry
</h3>
<p> 
That speaks of those who desire to surpass others. The Greek word, 

zelos, can denote both good and bad qualities. It is used sometimes 

to mean zeal and enthusiasm in pursuing a noble task, but here it 

speaks primarily of a begrudging resentment which envies the good 

fortune of others.</p>
<h3>
Wrath
</h3>
<p>
Wrath speaks of violent forms of anger. It represents storms of 

uncontrolled temper. It pictures the person who loses control when 

the car won't start or the fish won't bite or the calf won't drink 

or the meals aren't ready on time. The husband who steps out of the 

room and slams the door behind him because something doesn't suit 

him is displaying such fits of temper. <br>Such conduct indicates that 

he is still under the grip of the lower nature.</p>
<h3>
Strife
</h3>
<p>
Strife is translated from a Greek word which means “office seeking” 

or “canvassing for an office.” It describes those who would like to 

he elevated to a place of responsibility in the church, not so much 

for the service they can render, as for the prestige it might 

bring.<br> The woman described as <dr class="alt5">“the mother of 

Zebedee’s sons” (Matt 20.20)</dr class="alt5">, manifested this 

spirit when she requested that her sons would be granted a position 

on either side of the Lord in His kingdom. <br>Some will even 

manipulate events for their own personal gain.<p>
<h3>
Seditious
</h3>
<p>
Seditious speaks of divisions. The Greek word refers to any kind of 

commotion within the church that causes what is commonly known as 

“church splits.” <br>There may be times when separation from an 

apostate group has a place, but in most cases, the primary duty of 

every Christian is to witness faithfully right where he is. The 

most deplorable splits are those resulting from personality 

conflicts within the church.<br> When there are seditions, the unity 

and fellowship of the local body of Christ is fractured, and the 

testimony of the congregation in the community is marred. The 

divisive tendency (evident in many congregations) is the result of 

choosing to walk in the way of envy and bickering, rather than in 

the royal road of love, forgiveness, and magnanimity.</p>
<h3>
Heresies
</h3>
<p>
Heresies are ideas (schools of thought) that are contrary to the 

accepted fundamental historic doctrines of the Christian faith. <br>It 

seems like some theologians are always trying to dream up something 

new. All Christians, when listening to teaching and preaching, need 

to take a lesson from the Bereans, who <dr class="alt5">“searched 

the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things were so.” 

(Acts 17:11)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
Envy
</h3>
<p>
Envy speaks of a resentful desire for another's possessions or 

advantages. <br>It is closely related to the words jealous rivalry named 

earlier in the text<br> (Gal 5:20).<br> One major difference between the 

two words is that envy is always bad, whereas jealous rivalry is not.<br> 

The word translated “envy” (used here in Gal 5:21) is a totally 

evil concept and has no possibilities for good. The earlier words 

(jealous rivalry) may resent the good fortune of others, but the 

(envy) being considered here is so resentful that it may plot to 

destroy the other person.</p>
<h3>
Murders
</h3>
<p>
Murders is a reminder that snuffing out a human life involves more 

than sticking a knife into another person. It is possible to cast 

looks that are filled with murder, and to speak words that are 

intended to slay. Many a husband has brought his wife to an early 

death by his lack of love, his mean unappreciative spirit toward 

her, and his unfaithfulness to her.<br>
The evils labelled as hatred and wrath and strife and envy and 

seditious are sins of hostility. The ultimate corrective for strife 

and hatred and violence is respect for human beings, and a genuine 

love for fellow Christians.<br> We need to join Alexander Whyte in a 

prayer that he often prayed:<br> "Oh God, let it not be ill with me 

when it's well with others. Let me have the Holy Spirit, a fresh 

anointing of His presence and power, to promote my brother’s 

good!”</p>
<h2>
4. Sins of Intemperance
</h2>
<p>
The final category in the list of the “works of the flesh" is what 

we choose to call sins of intemperance. The two terms in this 

category have obvious meanings.</p>
<h3>
Drunkenness
</h3>
<p>
Drunkenness is a condition caused by drinking alcoholic beverages. 

<br>The reference is to being intoxicated with strong drink.<br> In the 

United States of America there are more than tell million confirmed 

alcoholics. Nearly four out of five high school seniors have drunk 

alcohol within any given month. Drunkenness is not a disease; it 

is, instead, a devastating sin.
When the Judgement Day comes, the lame excuse which says that 

alcoholism is a disease will not pass. The drunkard is listed in 

Scripture along with thieves, extortioners, and sodomites as those 

who will not inherit the kingdom of God <br>(I Cor 6:9-10).<br>
Drunkenness has killed more persons than all the wars of history 

put together During the Vietnam War, 50.000 American soldiers were 

killed. During that same period, five times that number (250.000 

people) were killed in our own country (America) - by motor car accidents 

caused by drunken drivers. Drinking alcohol has drained more blood, 

broken more homes and brought more misery than any other scourge 

that has ever cursed the human race.<br> Drunkenness is a shameful and 

degrading work of the flesh, and obviously has no place in the life 

of a Christian.</p>
<h3>
Revellings
</h3>
<p>
Revellings is a term associated with carousing and debauchery.<br> The 

Greek word also indicates “wild parties” and “horsing around.” 

Revellings refers to disorderly merrymaking, including celebrations 

that are typical at wild parties. The term speaks of engaging in 

loose, loud, frivolous, and boisterous behaviour. 

Revellings are common (in the world about us) when celebrating 

weddings, anniversaries, and holidays. <br>The Bible says that our 

conduct as believers, by way of contrast, should portray a gentle 

and quiet spirit, which is very precious in the sight of God (I 

Peter 3:4).</p>
<p>
Paul concludes the list with the words “and such like.” This is an 

indication that the list is not exhaustive. There are many other 

works of the flesh, similar to those given in (Gal 5:19-21) that 

are just as nefarious as the seventeen sins listed in the text.<br> God 

surely would include evils such as lying, slander, flattery, 

murmuring, complaining, covetousness, suspicion, smoking, 

impatience, rebellion, and injustice.<br>
The tense of the verb translated "do” means to habitually continue 

in the fleshly sins (Gal 5:21), rather than an isolated falling 

into the evil. Those who keep practising such sins are not being 

led by God's Spirit, and are warned that they shall not inherit 

God's kingdom. There is a difference between falling into sin 

(through carelessness), and living in sin (as a settled choice of 

life).</p>
<p>
True children of God hate these sins and shrink from them 

and if they do yield to temptation, they are in misery until they 

have confessed the sin and cried to God for mercy.
The way to gain increasing victory over the works of the flesh is 

found in verses 16 and 18 of Galatians 5, where we are admonished 

to “walk in the Spirit,” and to be “led of the Spirit.” To he “led” 

of the Spirit means more than to be guided by Him; it means to be 

controlled by Him.</p>
