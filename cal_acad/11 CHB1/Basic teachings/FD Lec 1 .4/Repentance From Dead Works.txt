<h1>
Repentance From Dead Works
</h1>
<p>
There are many churches in this world, this society, each with their own set of doctrines and beliefs, and each of those church's doctrines are different from those of another. Who is right? Are any of them right? How can we know?</p>
<h3>
Repentance from Dead Works
</h3>
<p><dr class="alt5">
"Therefore, leaving the discussion of the elementary principles of Christ, let us go on to perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God," (Heb 6:1)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Notice this verse mentions the word "foundation". This is one of the foundational principles of the Doctrine of Christ. And of course, it follows that if these are "dead works", then there must be "live works" or what we would call "good works".<br>
Most churches preach a doctrine of "no works". They say all one has to do is "just believe". They say Jesus kept the commandments for us and we don't have to do anything but believe.
Have you heard that? Of course you have. Just believe, Jesus did everything else. Another version of this is "once saved always saved".
Of course, we know this is NOT one of the Doctrines of Christ, don't we? Or do we?
Let's see then. What are "dead works"? According to Hebrews 6 they are something we must repent of! Could these "dead works" be the "works of sin"? YES. They are the very opposite of sinlessness or "good works". Does that make sense?
I would like to take you back to the two trees in the Garden of Eden.
in Gen 2: <dr class="alt5">
"The Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there He put the man whom He had formed. And out of the ground the Lord God made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil."<br>  
"And the Lord God commanded the man saying, Of every tree of the garden you may freely eat, but the tree of knowledge of good and evil, you may not eat of it; for in the day you eat thereof you shall surely die." (Gen. 2:8-9 and 16-17)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
The tree of decision
</h3>
<p>
Why? What makes the fruit of that tree so bad? It has GOOD in it! Right?
Well, that tree was and is a tree of decision! Choosing the fruit of that tree causes man to place himself in God's place, making his own decisions about what is right and what is wrong. God has not relinquished that prerogative!
Eve did that! She decided the fruit of that tree was "good for food," that it was "pleasant to the eyes," and that it was "desired to make one wise."
The problem with all that was that this "wisdom,"  this knowledge of good and evil, was an extremely superficial knowledge.</p>
<h3>
The tree of wisdom gave no understanding of Good and Evil 
</h3>
<p>
The fruit of this tree produced no understanding of how and why God made man, and of how God constructed man's mind. Without that understanding a person cannot know what is TRULY GOOD and what is TRULY EVIL.</p>
<h3>
The tree of Life gives understanding of Good and Evil 
</h3>
<p>
Only by eating of the Tree of Life can one begin to UNDERSTAND the difference between true good and true evil! This superficial knowledge without understanding leads to "dead works," which is ANYTHING we do that God's Word tells us not to do.
Let me state that again. Anything we do opposite God's Word are "dead works." The breaking of God's Ten Commandments are "dead works". It takes the Holy Spirit of God living in us to help us do "live works."</p>
<h3>
Live works

<p>
<dr class="alt5">"But he who looks into the perfect law of liberty and continues in it, and is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of the work, this one will be blessed in what he does. <br> Pure and undefiled religion before God and the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their trouble, and to keep oneself unspotted from the world.. " (James 1:25,27)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
So what do we do then?
<dr class="alt5">
"Therefore submit to God. Resist the devil and he will flee from you. Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners; and purify your hearts, you double-minded. Lament and mourn and weep! Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and He will lift you up. (James 4:7-10)</dr class="alt5">
THE ABOVE ARE GOOD WORKS. THEY ARE LIVE WORKS. That is what we begin to do when we REPENT OF "DEAD WORKS." ()
Those are Live Works!

Dead works

If anyone among you thinks he is religious, and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his own heart, this one’s religion is useless. (James 1:26)</dr class="alt5">
<dr class="alt5">"My brethren, do not hold the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with partiality. For if there should come into your assembly a man with gold rings, in fine apparel, and there should also come in a poor man in filthy clothes, and you pay attention to the one wearing the fine clothes and say to him, “You sit here in a good place,” and say to the poor man, “You stand there,” or, “Sit here at my footstool,” have you not shown partiality among yourselves, and become judges with evil thoughts?" (James 2:1-4)</dr class="alt5">
also:
<dr class="alt5">"but if you show partiality, you commit sin, and are convicted by the law as transgressors." (James 2:9)</dr class="alt5">
BEING A RESPECTER OF PERSONS IS A "DEAD WORK."
<dr class="alt5">
"Do not grumble against one another, brethren, lest you be condemned. Behold, the Judge is standing at the door"! (James 5:9)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
This word "Grumble" means to cause harm to one another or to put them in "straits" or "hardship." GRUMBLING AGAINST ONE ANOTHER IS A "DEAD WORK"  OF WHICH WE MUST REPENT.
<dr class="alt5">
2 Tim. 3:1-5
"But know this, that in the last days perilous times will come: For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good, traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having a form of godliness but denying its power..."</dr class="alt5">
These are ALL "dead works" of which we MUST repent !!!
Those "dead works" are the result of the eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, that superficial knowledge without understanding!
<dr class="alt5">
"Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. 16 For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not of the Father but is of the world.." (1 John 2:15-16)</<dr class="alt5">
These "works" are the same ones that Eve decided to do. She decided what was good for mankind and what was evil, symbolically taking God's place as ruler.
As John says,<dr class="alt5"> "My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue; but IN DEED AND IN TRUTH!" (1 John 3:18)</dr class="alt5">
We MUST turn from giving "lip service" to the good works and begin to love as God loves...in DEED and in TRUTH. We MUST REPENT of "dead works."
We all must get our act together! We must repent and change, going the other way and doing truly good works as defined by the scriptures.
As I bring you the other six basic principles of the Doctrine of Christ, perhaps you will see a pattern developing in the churches that show which tree they have been eating from.
But as for now, my friends, let's REPENT of "dead works" and really turn to God!!
