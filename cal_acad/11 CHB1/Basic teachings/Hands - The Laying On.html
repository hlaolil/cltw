Hands - The Laying On 
</h1>
<p>
To someone in the world, "laying on of hands" conjures up thoughts like,<br> "I'd like to get my hands on him for the way he cheated me!" or, "Just wait until I get my hands on him!" In sharp contrast, God's use of the laying on of hands symbolises the bestowal of blessings, authority and distinctiveness. <br>It is a symbolic act designed to represent God Himself setting a person apart for a holy use, whether for service, healing, protection and guidance or blessing. 
<h3>
1.Offering sacrifices Old Testament
</h3>
<p>
The Aaronic priests were purified for service to God through the transferral of their sins to a bull. Similarly, when an Israelite presented a peace or a sin offering, he laid his hands upon the animal being offered, identifying himself with it and transferring his guilt to the animal. Thus, the animal was set apart by God through the laying on of hands. Ex 29:10; Lev 1:4; 3:2, 8, 13; 4:15.</p>
<h3>
2.Laying hands on the Azazel goat on the day of Atonement
</h3>
<p>
The goat that represented Jesus Christ was offered as a sin offering, typifying His taking our sins upon Himself as an innocent substitute sacrifice.<br> The other goat, representing Satan, was called the azazel. The high priest laid his hands upon the Azazel goat's head, confessing the sins of the people. <br>The goat, now bearing those sins, was driven into the wilderness.<br> Lev 16:7-10, 21-22.<br>
After Christ's return, Satan will bear his own guilt and be completely removed from man's presence, being bound for 1,000 years (Rev 20:1-3).
<h3>
3. Laying on of hands used in Old Testament ordinations
</h3>
<p>
Moses laid his hands upon Joshua, signifying the transferral of some of his authority to lead the nation. This rite of ordination was always accompanied by a special commission and the giving of special authority.<br> Num 8:10; 27:16-23; Deut 34:9.</p>
<h3>
4. Laying on of hands was used in passing judgement  
</h3>
<p>
God laid His hands on Egypt in divine judgement by sending plagues. <br>When trying a blasphemer, each witness placed his hands upon the guilty person to signify his acceptance of the verdict. <br>Conversely, when a victim was spared death—as when God commanded Abraham not to sacrifice Isaac or when He allowed the leaders of Israel to see Him without dying—mercy is described as hands not being laid on the spared victim. Ex 7:4; Lev 24:14; Deut 13:6-10 Gen 22:12; Ex 24:9-11.</p>
<h3>
5. Special blessings conferred by the laying on of hands
</h3>
<p> 
Jacob laid his hands on his grandsons' heads to confer God's blessing upon them.<br> David considered God's hand upon him as a blessing and comfort.<br> Jesus blessed little children by laying His hands on them. <br>Gen 48:12-20; Psa 139:4-6; Mark 10:13-16; Luke 18:15-17.</p>
<h3>
6. The Bible sanctions the laying on of hands for healing 
</h3>
<p>
Jesus and His apostles touched the sick when they healed, yet miracles often occurred without this physical act. The miraculous power to heal derives from God's authority, not from the physical touch of the hands.<br> Matt 9:18-30; Mark 6:5; 16:17-18; Luke 4:40; 13:10-13; Acts 5:12; 28:8; James 5:14-15.</p>
<h3>
7. Special spiritual gifts given through the laying on of hands 
</h3>
<p>
Usually, the Holy Spirit was given by the laying on of an elder's hands, confirming baptism.<br>However, Acts 8:14-17 says that the Samaritans received the Holy Spirit after baptism, while Acts 10:44-48 says that it fell upon Cornelius' household before baptism. Sometimes God makes exceptions to work out His own will and plan.
Timothy received special spiritual gifts from the hands of the elders, including the gifts of wisdom and teaching. Paul reminded him that ordination bestowed such gifts upon him and that he needed to stir up God's Spirit to use them.<br> Acts 9:17; 19:6; I Tim 4:14; 2 Tim 1:6-7.</p>
<h3>
8. This rite used to set people apart for special tasks
</h3>
<p> 
As in these examples, the laying on of hands is part of a formal ceremony by which the church commissions selected people into their new service.<br> Paul advises that this should take place only after the entire matter is properly and prayerfully considered.
Laying on of hands, performed by ordained elders of the church during prayer, signifies an ordination or setting apart. The church, following biblical precedent, uses the laying on of hands for requesting the Holy Spirit after baptism, anointing the sick, ordaining ministers, consecrating marriage vows, blessing little children and requesting special gifts of God.<br>
Acts 6:3-6; 13:2-3; I Timothy 5:22.
