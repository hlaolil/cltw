Speaking in tongues 
</h1>
<p>
Speaking in tongues only edifies oneself and does not edify others but alienates instead</p>
<p>
<font color= "blue">
For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful. What is the conclusion then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the understanding. I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with the understanding. Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how will he who occupies the place of the uninformed say “Amen” at your giving of thanks, since he does not understand what you say? For you indeed give thanks well, but the other is not edified. I thank my God I speak with tongues more than you all; (1 Cor 14:14-18) </font></p>
<p>
So if you, in using a strange tongue, say words which have no sense, how will anyone take in what you are saying? for you will be talking to the air.<br> There are a number of different languages in the world, and no voice is without sense.<br> But if the sense of the voice is not clear to me, I am like a man from a strange country to him who is talking, and he will be the same to me.</p>
<p>
The speaking, praying or singing in tongues is not suitable or meant for everyone. Also speaking in tongues is not at all suitable for edifying the Congregation of God. Nor is speaking in tongues suitable for bringing the Gospel.<br> The speaking in tongues is primarily for unbelievers; therefore God gives them this Sign; to edify and lead them personally. </p>
<h3>
How to speak in tongues according to the Bible 
</h3>
<p>
Clearly the Bible teaches us, that only few people can speak in tongues.<br> When people speak in tongues, tongue-translators have to be present and translating as well. When people speak in tongues in the absence of tongue-translators it may well indicate that the spoken language and message is not of God at all!</p>
<p>
The speaking, praying or singing in tongues is best done behind closed doors in personal circumstances [like your own house or room]. <br>Clearly the speaking of tongues will edify only yourself.</p>
<p>
The Bible tells us that speaking in tongues actually is a minor Gift since it does not edify- or teach others. Therefore the Bible asks Christians to desire the higher Gifts instead!</p>
