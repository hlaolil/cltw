   <h1>
The Endurance of the Father
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
And the son said to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and and in your sight, and am no longer worthy to be called your son." But the father said to his slaves, "Bring out the best robe and put it on him; put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet. And bring the fatted calf here and kill it, and let us eat and be merry; for this my son was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found!" (Luke 15:22-24)</font></p>
<p>
You might not think of the Prodigal Son as a person of character. After all, it was a lack of character that got him into trouble in the first place. <br>I imagine he wanted for nothing as a child – his father was both wealthy and generous. Maybe too generous. <br>You know the story. He asks for his share of his inheritance, the father gives, and off he goes to find his fame and fortune. What he finds instead is that his money wasn’t going last forever. It didn’t last long at all. He finds himself in the sewer dreaming of home, remembering the generosity of his father.<br> There in the depths of despair, with only the pigs for companions, those worthy and lasting values of his father are awakened.<br> The prodigal resolves to go home and beg forgiveness. And at last the seeds of character planted by his father take root and begin to bear fruit.</p>
<p>
The parable is most often named for the prodigal, but it is the father who is the central character, the central character of character. <br>Like the prodigal, the father made his share of mistakes. He was a loving and gracious father, but he was not perfect. Perhaps he indulged his children to the point of excess. <br>In a sense the Father is a tragic figure, alienated from one son at the beginning of the story and from the other at the end.<br> For sure he endured the sufferings and perplexities of parenthood.</p>
<p>
The father is the same gracious and loving father at the parable’s beginning and ending. But I also think that like his younger son, and unlike his older son, he grew through his experience. <br>There are still some loose ends at the end of the parable, but the gracious father is ready and eager to resume a loving relationship with both of his sons. He was and remained a loving, accepting, forgiving, and gracious father, ready and eager to give his children what they needed for life.<br> He was and remained a man of character.</p>
<p>
For Jesus, suffering, endurance, character and hope are all bundled together in one word: Compassion. Jesus was filled with compassion for persons in need. Jesus endured human suffering so that human suffering might be endured. Jesus brought hope to those without hope. And in calling his disciples to live with compassion, that hope continues. In persons of character, that hope abounds. For the hope God gives in Jesus Christ does not fail.</p>
<p>
In the parable of the prodigal, while the boy is still far off, the father runs to greet him and welcome him home. Why? Because he was filled with compassion. <br>Just like the Good Samaritan was filled with compassion for the beaten man in the ditch, so also the gracious father was filled with compassion when he saw his prodigal son coming home. Filled with compassion – touched in the heart and actively responding with the hands. Filled with compassion. That is the essence of Christian character.</p>
<p>
Suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and that hope does not fail, because God's compassionate love has been poured into our hearts.</p>
