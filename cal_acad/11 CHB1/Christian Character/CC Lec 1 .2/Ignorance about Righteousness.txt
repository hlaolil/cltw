Ignorance about Righteousness

<p><font color= "blue">
For everyone who partakes only of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe. (Heb 5:13)</font></p>
 <p>
The author seems to be making a big issue out of this point. Many people today desperately need the same message.
Those who rely on milk are "unskilful in the word of righteousness." The word unskilful means "unacquainted with, unaccustomed to — the teaching about righteousness. 
Today, there are still countless multitudes who are unacquainted with the teachings about righteousness.</p>
 <p>
Righteousness may be considered from a number of different aspects. <br>

First, there is the righteousness of Jesus because of His faithfulness to His calling, even to death.</p>
 
Then, there is the righteousness of The God because He is faithful to fulfil His covenant promises. The righteousness of The God comes to final fulfilment in the coming kingdom of God when all the covenant promises come to fruition.</p>
 <p>
Third, there is the righteousness, or deeds, which humans are called upon to do. However, these works of righteousness can only be accomplished by allowing The God to live through us so His will may be done.</p>
 <p>
Of all these different kinds of righteousness, the context shows that the author was referring to the latter works of righteousness done through people.<br>
Understanding proper works, or righteousness, is one of the most difficult scriptural concepts for believers today. "Babes" always seek to fulfil their concept of righteousness by fleshly works. They lack sufficient knowledge to realise that righteousness depends on The God working in us both to will and to do.</p>
 <p>
Before any of our works can be considered righteous we must commit ourselves to The God. Then, and only then, may our works be considered righteous deeds. After we totally commit ourselves to The God on the basis of faith and love, then that portion of holy spirit we have, together with the scriptures, will guide us into righteousness.</p>
 <p>
Unfortunately, many church members know little more about scripture than non-church members. Both are still babes when it comes to understanding The God’s word. Many people are simply too lazy or too disinterested to concentrate on studying the Bible for any length of time. Their attention span is limited, and so is what they can learn.</p>
 <p>
On the other hand, let the subject turn to the cares and concerns of this world, or how to acquire more earthly goods, and their attention changes immediately. Many people—including many church members—place far more emphasis on earthly issues than on spiritual issues.</p>
