   <h1>
A Picture of the Father
</h1>
<p>
I remember visiting a dear friend hours before her death and reminding her that death is not the end, that we believe in the Resurrection. I asked her, “Are you there yet?” She replied, “I go back and forth.” <br>There was nothing I wanted more than to bring out a bag of proof and say, “See? You can be absolutely confident now.” But there is no absolute bag of proof. I just stayed with her. A life of faith is often lived “back and forth” by believers and those who minister to them.</p>
<p>
Implicit here is the question of how we look to God to act and to enter our lives. For whatever reason, certainly foreign to most of us, God has chosen to enter the world today through others, through us.<br> We have stories of miraculous interventions, lightning-bolt moments, but far more often the God of unconditional love comes to us in human form, just as God did over 2,000 years ago.</p>
<p>
First, I do not expect to have all the answers, nor do I believe that people are really looking for them.<br> 
Second, I don’t look for the hand of God to stop evil. I don’t expect comfort to come from afar. I really do believe that God enters the world through us.<br> And even though I still have the “Why?” questions, they are not so much “Why, God?” questions. We are human and mortal. We will suffer and die. But how we are with one another in that suffering and dying makes all the difference as to whether God’s presence is felt or not and whether we are comforted or not.</p>
<p>
One true thing is this: Faith is lived in family and community, and God is experienced in family and community. We need one another to be God’s presence.<br> When my younger brother, died suddenly at 44 years old, I was asking “Why?” and I experienced family and friends as unconditional love in the flesh.<br> They couldn’t explain why he died. Even if they could, it wouldn’t have brought him back. Yet the many ways that people reached out to me let me know that I was not alone. They really were the presence of God to me. They held me up to preach at his funeral. They consoled me as I tried to comfort others. Suffering isolates us. Loving presence brings us back, makes us belong.</p>
<p>
A contemporary theologian has described mercy as “entering into the chaos of another.” <br>Christmas is really a celebration of the mercy of God who entered the chaos of our world in the person of Jesus, mercy incarnate. <br>I have never found it easy to be with people who suffer, to enter into the chaos of others. Yet, every time I have done so, it has been a gift to me, better than the wrapped and ribboned packages. I am pulled out of myself to be love’s presence to someone else, even as they are love’s presence to me.</p>
<p>
I will never satisfactorily answer the question “Why?” because no matter what response I give, it will always fall short.<br>What I do know is that an unconditionally loving presence soothes broken hearts, binds up wounds, and renews us in life.<br> This is a gift that we can all give, particularly to the suffering. When this gift is given, God’s love is present and Christmas happens daily.</p>
