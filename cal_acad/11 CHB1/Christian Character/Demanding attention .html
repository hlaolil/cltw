   <h1>
Demanding attention 
</h1>
<p> 
The child whose will is never subdued when young, comes to believe that he should have what he wants, when he wants it, and should not have to endure anything he does not like. <br> He will grow older thinking he is being deprived whenever he does not get what he wants from life, and by his teen years he will become preoccupied with his “rights” and know little of personal responsibility. <br> The indulged child is frequently angry because he does not get what he thinks is owed him. Ultimately, he will develop a “victim” mentality—nothing is ever his fault—someone else is always to blame for his misery.</p>
 <p>
Some parents believe that maturity is an inevitable part of growing up and will happen naturally to all children, whether trained or not. <br>Proper rearing of children, in their view, requires only that a parent love them, take them to church, and try to give them a happy childhood.  <br>To them, maturity is a guaranteed by product of getting older, so they do little to help the process, and without realising it—much to hurt it. <br> All children, unless calamity occurs, will grow older, but only those groomed toward maturity will attain it.  Hence, as parents, we must work diligently to help our children develop the qualities leading to maturity.</p>
 <h3>
What characterises immaturity?
</h3>
<p> 
To clarify the definition of maturity, we must understand immaturity. <br> The child whose will is not subdued in the first few years of life is hampered in the maturing process.  No matter how old he gets, a strong self-will ruled by the craving for self-indulgence will be the mark of his immaturity. <br> Sadly, this self-indulgence characterises most children today—even in Christian families.  As caring parents it is especially important for us to identify and eliminate that in our child-rearing which feeds the will and fosters self-indulgence in our children.</p>
 <h3>
Immaturity and self-indulgence
 </h3>
<p>
Self-indulgence is the drive which demands the satisfaction of one’s wants and desires.  Consider the following symptoms that are exhibited. <br>
They are indulged if they lack self control.<br>
Self-indulgence people rarely say “NO” to themselves.
They have a difficult time doing in moderation anything which gratifies; they frequently over do it.
They do whatever they feel like, or are so used to having their way they think they should have whatever they want.
The satisfaction of their own will is foremost in their life—others are considered second, if at all.</p>
 <h3>
Self-centredness
</h3>
<p>
Self-centredness so rules self-indulgent people that they live as if the world revolved around them—life is interpreted by how it affects them.<br>
Whenever the self-centred child approaches his parents with a question (which may be frequent), it usually involves something he wants for himself.<br> He has few sincere questions regarding the well-being of others.<br>
One who is self-consumed, pushes and lobbies constantly to get what is wanted; persists even after being refused.<br>
May think of others, but only after satisfying themselves.<br>
Insist on their“rights” to personal decisions and “living their own life.”<br>
Think they deserve everything that is given to them, and are unappreciative despite the feelings of others; not easily satisfied.<br>
They are seldom happy; complain and whine a majority of the time; often discontent.
Complain about food or any gift set before them.<br>
They are preoccupied with fun and self-gratification.<br>
Expect for life to be exciting; demand entertainment; frequently bored.<br>
Expect to have their own way; express blatant irritation when desires are thwarted.
Impatient; demand others immediate attention.</p>
 <h3> 
A desire for gratification
</h3>
<p>
Their desire for gratification rules them, affecting all of their decisions and actions; they are impulsive and lack discretion.
They consistently squander money (or save it with the intent of spending it on themselves).<br>
They do not learn from their mistakes; they repeatedly get into trouble for the same offence.<br>
They cannot be left alone and trusted to make wise choices.<br>
In response to attacks and offences from younger siblings, they retaliate as if they were small children themselves.<br>
When confronted by problems, they foolishly “bury their heads in the sand” and pretend the problem will go away.</p>
 <h3>
They are indulged when they sin
</h3>
<p>
When they sin, they habitually deny their responsibility.<br>
Nothing is ever their fault.  They are always a victim of others failures. Someone or something else is to blame.<br>
When they get caught for breaking the rules, they do not see their penalty as a consequence of their choices, but hold responsible the one who caught them or turned them in.<br>
Even their anger is someone else’s fault.<br>
They resent work or anything that requires self-discipline.<br>
They are lazy; they habitually play during chore time, and look for ways to get out of work.<br>
They despise opportunities to serve others, particularly their siblings.<br>
Any thought of serving others rarely crosses their mind.<br>
In response to assigned chores—roll their eyes; complain; disappear before, during and after task; do as little as possible.<br>
After completion of assigned tasks, refuse to ask, “Is there anything more I can do?”</p>
<p>
Indulged children are unprepared for adulthood. <br> They have been sent the message that their personal happiness is of supreme importance, so they grow up thinking it is owed them. <br> They ultimately lack the self-discipline necessary for successful employment, and their self-centredness will cause strife in their marriages. <br> Then when their marriages fail, they will not consider it their fault—they will be innocent “victims” of their spouse’s shortcomings.<br> From the time they are young, our children must learn that life is not about fun and entertainment, nor is it about personal happiness and self-gratification. It is about responsibility and serving others. <br> It is finding joy in honouring God and loving our neighbours.
 <h3>
What has life taught us?
 </h3>
<p>
Those of us who have lived for at least 25 years have learned that life is hard—things don’t always go our way—we don’t always get what we want in life.  Our children must be prepared in their youth for the challenges they will find in life.  They must learn that they cannot have everything they want, and that they can endure well with less than they hoped for.<br>  To mature properly, children must learn while they are still toddlers to obey their parents quickly and without resistance, and to endure hard situations humbly.  With their parents help, they can learn as early as possible to die to themselves, preparing them to live for Christ.  Otherwise, as teenagers, they will remain self-consumed, rebellious, and far from God.  May we as parents be faithful to do what is right.</p>
