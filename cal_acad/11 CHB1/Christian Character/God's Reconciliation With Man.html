   <h1>
God's Reconciliation With Man
</h1>
<h3>
Love
</h3>
<p>
The important virtue that rings with a clear sound throughout the 

entirety of the Bible is love. There are two commandments which are 

the most important in relation to human responsibility. <br> Jesus said, <font color= "blue">“You shall love the Lord your God with all 

your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the 

first and great commandment. And the second is like it: You shall love 

your neighbour as yourself.” (Matt 22:37–39)</font>. These commands 

about love are of continual relevance, and their truth is eternal as 

to time and universal in space.<br>Nothing can surpass true love. <font 

color= "blue">“And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the 

greatest of these is love” (1 Cor 13:13)</font>.<br>
Love is supreme. It is the major virtue associated with the 

righteousness and holiness of God. Indeed, the Bible says that God not 

only possesses a perfect love, He Himself is love (1 John 4:8).<br> God 

owns a perfect holiness and His righteousness is absolute. There is 

not the slightest taint of sin associated with Him.<br> In contrast, all 

men are sinners. <font color= "blue">“All have sinned and fall short 

of the glory of God” (Rom 3:23)</font>.<br> There is no human who can 

stand before God and say he has never sinned. Our imperfections are 

clearly evident.</p>
<h3>
God’s Separation from Man
</h3>
<p>
The Bible shows a vast chasm which separates man in his sinfulness 

from God and His righteousness. In the past, God stood far off from 

the sinner.<br> Even the Bible speaks of such a separation. <font color= 

"blue">“Holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners” (Heb 

7:26)</font>.<br>This fact has given rise to the belief that God must 

have an utter disdain for humans — that He does not love man. Why 

should He love humans while they openly sin, often with malice 

aforethought? There are people who think that God is so disgusted with 

mankind that He will soon destroy most from the face of the earth and 

judge them in a burning hell. Certainly the Bible shows that God does 

not like the actions of men. And, He is a God of judgement (Dan 9:11–

14).<br> But in the Bible, God’s judgement is best summed up by the words 

of Paul, <font color= "blue">“For whom the Lord loves He chastens” 

(Heb 12:6)</font>. <br>Notice that verse carefully. Even in judgement God 

is called One who loves.<br>

The majority of people know that they are sinners, and they think God 

must not like them. They can hardly imagine that God loves the 

ungodly, the overt sinner, or those who are His enemies.<br> While Christ 

may command men to love their enemies (Matt 5:43–44), it is thought 

that God, on the other hand, will not love His enemies. <br>God dislikes 

sin and He will use judgement and chastisement to correct mankind; but 

does God really hate man? The fact is the Bible shows that God loves 

man so much that the magnitude of His love is almost incomprehensible 

to imagine.<br>

We will now look at some of the most beautiful verses in Scripture 

which show that God does love mankind — that He loves man abundantly, 

in spite of his ways.</p>
<h3>
How God Shows His Love to Man
</h3>
<p>
God uses one major event in history to demonstrate the depth of His 

love: the sending of His own Son to die on the tree of crucifixion for 

sinful man.<br> Paul shows that through the crucifixion of Christ we see 

the over abundance of love which God has for mankind.<br> <font color= 

"blue">“For when we were still without strength, in due time Christ 

died for the ungodly” (Rom 5:6)</font>.

 This particular verse in Romans begins a context in which Paul shows 

how God has reconciled Himself to ungodly man. <br>In the book of Romans 

Paul starts by saying that Christ came to die for the unrighteous. He 

did not die for those who were worthy and holy. <br>He died for mankind 

while man was very much in an ungodly and unholy state. He was willing 

to lay down His own life for the sake of man while man was evil, 

unrighteous, reprobate. <br>Paul’s discussion is about God’s love and 

reconciliation to man. <br>He introduces the theme and develops it, <font 

color= "blue">“But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that, 

while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us” (Rom 5:8)</font>.</p>
<h3>
Before Repentance
</h3>
<p>
 Many people feel that God only shows love upon people once they 

repent of sin, accept Christ, and then try to live a righteous life.<br> 

While it must be admitted that the Christian should do these virtuous 

acts (and a true Christian will endeavour to perform them), it is not 

true that God only shows His love towards mankind when man does 

righteous acts. No, not at all. <br>Paul said that God showed His love to 

us by dying for us “while we were yet sinners” and “while we were 

ungodly.”<br>

 It is quite common to love someone who responds with an equal love.<br> 

It is rare, however, to love someone when the person shows disdain to 

you. But God’s love is very rare. God even loves people who are 

ungodly and are abject sinners. In fact, His love is so paramount that 

God says He loves humans who are actively His enemies. God reconciles 

Himself to His enemies while they are still in hostility.<br>This 

statement may appear to be strange and impossible, but it is not.<br>

Notice what Paul says,
<font color= "blue">
“For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death 

of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by 

His life.” (Rom 5:10)</font>
<h3>
When You Are His Enemy
</h3>
<p>
 These are important words. God’s reconciliation to mankind took place 

when man was actively God’s enemy — not after man repented!<br> An enemy 

is not someone who simply falls short of being a friend. Not at all. 

An enemy is on the other side of the fence. He is in absolute 

opposition and his actions are hateful. The dictionary says an enemy 

is one “who shows hatred and hostility, a foe, an antagonist, an 

opponent, one you are at war against.”<br> And it was while mankind was in 

this state of utter hostility and in direct opposition to God 

that<font color= "blue"> “we were reconciled to God by the death of 

his Son” (Rom 5:10)</font>.

 The English word “to reconcile” means to restore friendship between 

two people who were hostile to one another. It means to, “make up;” 

“settle an argument; ... to bring back into harmony.” Our English word 

“reconcile” means that the “making up” must be accomplished by both 

parties who were at odds with one another.<br> But the New Testament is 

different. “According to Paul, reconciliation is brought about by God 

alone.” The word “reconciliation” when used in our English language 

almost always means that both parties, which were hostile to one 

another mutually, agree to resume a harmonious relationship.<br> But the 

English is not the same as Paul’s use of the Greek. <br>God’s 

reconciliation to man in Romans is from God’s side only. God alone 

decides to make peace with man, and He does it through the death of 

Christ — while man is still very much ungodly, a sinner, and while he 

is an active enemy to God.</p>
<p>

This one-sided reconciliation on God’s part was to Paul a self-evident 

proof of God’s superabundant love to man. <font color= "blue">“But God 

demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still 

sinners, Christ died for us.” (Rom 5:8)</font>.<br> Christ did this <font color= "blue">“when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son,” (Rom 5:10)</font>.<br>

As far as God was concerned, He loved us so much that He was willing 

to pay all the penalties of our sins, forget our rebelliousness, and 

overlook our hostility, while we were still sinners, still rebellious, 

and still hostile.<br> To Paul this surely showed that God must love us — 

and love us pre-eminently.<br>

Humanly speaking, a husband (or a wife) might be willing to die for 

his mate if the situation called for it. This is because they both 

love one another dearly. Good parents might die on behalf of their 

children because they also love them. <br>Indeed, one might be willing to 

die for a righteous person. Even Paul used this illustration,
<font color= "blue">
“For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet perhaps for a good 

man someone would even dare to die” (Rom 5:7)</font><br>

But God has done more than any man would ever do. He sent His Son to 

die willingly for people who were aggressively ungodly. We repeat what 

Paul said, <font color= "blue">“But God demonstrates His own love 

toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us” 

(Rom 5:8)</font>.
<h3>
Through His Son
</h3>
<p>
While a human might be willing to die for a loved one, such as a wife, 

a husband, a child, a parent, or a good friend, who of us would gladly 

lay down his life so that an ardent enemy might live? A Nero? A 

Genghis Khan? A Hitler? This would take extraordinary love. But this 

is what God has done for the human race. He showed His love by paying 

the penalty for all sin by dying in the place of all humanity.<br>
<font color= "blue">
“For the love of Christ compels us, because we judge thus: that if One 

died for all, then all died;” (2 Cor 5:14)</font><br>

In Christ, God reconciled himself to man completely. The 

reconciliation has been one-sided because the majority of mankind has 

not yet become reconciled to Him. Most have not yet extended the hand 

of friendship to God in making peace. God has had to perform all the 

action for harmony so far.</p>

<p>Christians, on the other hand, have come to 

the place of recognising God’s reconciliation and they have accepted 

it.
<font color= "blue">
“but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through 

whom we have now received the reconciliation” (Rom 5:11)</font>

Note that Paul says Christians have “received the reconciliation.” It 

is God alone who did the harmonious act. We have had nothing to do 

with it. It has been one-sided, and on God’s part. All we have had to 

do is to receive the reconciliation that God has made with mankind.<br>

Let us look at God’s reconciliation in everyday terms. <br>Suppose you 

have a next-door neighbour who dislikes you intensely. The man is 

really your active enemy. Every chance he gets to do you wrong, he 

takes it. <br>Even when you have tried to live in harmony with him, he has 

spurned all your efforts and responded with even more evil. It is 

humanly easy to despise such an ingrate. Suppose, however, that the 

man would repent and become civil. Perhaps you might forgive him and 

try to live once again in peace with him. But if there was no 

repentance in evidence and the man continued his hostility toward you, 

and even became worse, would you willingly reconcile yourself to him? 

The normal appraisal of such a neighbour would be to call him an 

unregenerate wretch, ungodly, a sinner, and an enemy and you would 

probably try to avoid him.</p>
<p>
Let us go further with the illustration. Suppose a situation arose in 

which your neighbour was sentenced by a court of law to be executed. 

No doubt the ordinary human response would be, “Good riddance!”<br> But 

suppose it were possible for someone to die in his stead so that your 

neighbour could go free and live. He is your enemy. Could you possibly 

love your neighbour so much that you would be willing to take his 

place and die for him? Hardly! <br>As Paul said,<font color= "blue"> 

“perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die” <br>(Rom 

5:7)</font> but to die for such an ungodly enemy as your wretched 

neighbour, one would not consider it at all.<br>

 The truth is, however, someone did love the man so much that He 

stepped forward to die for him — and while the man was still 

unrepentant.<br> This is what Paul is saying. <font color= "blue">“Christ 

died for the ungodly” (Rom 5:6)</font>.<br> He did not die for some good, 

righteous, and repentant neighbour.<br> Christ died for those who were 

active sinners and His enemies.<br>
<font color= "blue">
“God demonstrates His love toward us, in that, while we were yet 

sinners, Christ died for us.” (Rom 5:8)</font></p>
<p>
<font color= "blue">
“When we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of His 

Son.” (Rom 5:10)</font><br>

God made up His mind to become completely reconciled to mankind before 

man made any signs of making peace with God. This would be like you 

deciding on your part to make up with your neighbour while he was 

still hostile and unrepentant towards you. Likewise, God’s 

reconciliation was all one-sided on His part. The great majority of 

“neighbours” are still against God and do not yet want to make up with 

God. <br>Only Christians, however, have presently been willing to receive 

that reconciliation of Him. Christians are like those neighbours who 

have responded to the one-sided reconciliation and have accepted His 

love. <br>The rest of the world is still ungodly, still sinners, still 

God’s enemies.<br> They have not come to peace terms with Him, but 

nevertheless, He has told the world through Paul’s teachings that He 

has reconciled Himself to them because of His love for them. This is 

what the Bible says.
<h3>
Christians Now Have the Ministry of Reconciliation
</h3>
<p>
 Paul further mentions this theme of God’s reconciliation in other 

parts of his epistles. This teaching is a major cornerstone of the 

Gospel of Christ.<br> Mankind has long ago been reconciled to God, from 

God’s point of view, whether they realise it or not.<br> Note what Paul 

says:
<font color= "blue">
“All things are of God, who has reconciled us to Himself by Jesus 

Christ, and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation.” <br>(2 Cor 

5:18)</font><br>

What is this ministry that Paul said Christians have? He explains it like this
<font color= "blue">
“that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not imputing their trespasses to them, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation". (2 Cor 5:19)</font><br>

 This is glorious teaching — and it is true. When Christ died on the 

tree, all the world was being reconciled to God — all the world was 

reckoned as dying on that tree.
<font color= "blue">
“For the love of Christ compels us; because we judge thus, that if One 

died for all, then all died.” (2 Cor 5:14)</font><br>

 It is the love that Christ has for the totality of the world (not 

just a part of it) that made Him die for it. God was <font color= "blue">“reconciling the 

world to himself.”</font> And look! In that reconciling (when God was making 

peace with the world), He took no notice of man’s sins. <font color= "blue">“Not imputing 

their trespasses to them.”</font> </p>

<p>That is what the Bible says, and that is 

what it means.<br>

Look once again at the illustration about the neighbour who might be 

your enemy. He committed many trespasses against you personally. If 

you would do as Christ did for us, you would have to disallow every 

single trespass that your neighbour ever committed against you. You 

would have to forget all his trespasses.<br> This is what Christ has done 

with us. While mankind was still ungodly, still sinners, still 

enemies, and with millions of trespasses in evidence which have been 

committed against Christ, He, nevertheless, decided not to impute a 

single trespass to man regarding His reconciliation with him. He has 

one-sidedly reconciled Himself to mankind through the death of Christ 

on the tree. All sins and hostility are paid for as far as God is 

concerned. This is what the Bible says, and it is time all people 

begin to believe it.</p>
<p>
The ministry of reconciliation which Paul said was his responsibility 

to teach, was a ministry to make known this message of love that God 

the Father and Christ have for mankind. They have such concern for the 

world that Christ willingly died for all; He has not imputed any sins 

against people; and He has a deep love for them.<br>
<font color= "blue">
“God so loved the world that He gave his only begotten Son, that 

whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life.” 

(John 3:16)</font><br>

The truth is, so few people even know what this message of love is all 

about. How can the doctrine of reconciliation be professed if it is 

not taught, and how can one teach it unless it be understood? Yet the 

Bible has clear instruction on the reconciliation. It is the essence 

of the Gospel.<br>
<font color= "blue">
“Now then we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God were pleading 

through us: we pray you on Christ’s behalf, be reconciled to God.” (2 

Cor 5:20)</font>
<h3>
Paul’s Two-fold Message
</h3>
<p>
Paul was an ambassador to carry forth a twofold message in the 

ministry of reconciliation. One, he told people that God so loves them 

that Christ died for them while they were yet ungodly, yet sinners, 

and God’s enemies.<br> God has already done His part in the reconciliation 

by not imputing any of humanity’s trespasses to their account. The 

slate is clean as far as God is concerned. There are no longer 

barriers between them and God.<br> Christ has died for them because He 

supremely loves them. </p>
<p>
The second part of Paul’s responsibility was to 

tell mankind to receive that reconciliation which God has already 

accomplished. <br>He told them, <font color= "blue">“be reconciled to God” 

(2 Cor 5:20)</font> .

A true reconciliation can only be a success when both parties agree to 

forgive and forget; when complete harmony exists between both; when 

both of them become real friends once again. What remains is for 

mankind, on their own part, to be reconciled to God. God has already 

forgiven us our trespasses and forgotten our sins through the death of 

Christ on the cross. <br>Now mankind themselves must respond to God’s love. 

They must be sorry for their sins, must repent of them, and must now 

take steps to be in harmony with God. When this is accomplished, a 

total reconciliation is effected. <br>So Paul’s ministry was twofold:

to tell people that God has reconciled Himself to them, and then,
to tell all to respond and accept the reconciliation and be at peace 

with God.<br>
Perfect peace, harmony, reunion and conciliation will then come to 

pass.
<h3>
The Evils of Sin — and Punishment
</h3>
<p>
There is, however, one important point to remember concerning the sins 

which mankind commits. Though the Bible shows that sins are not 

imputed regarding God’s reconciliation, mankind can still suffer for 

the sins that he commits. Sins are evil. What a man sows he will reap. 

Sin should be avoided at all costs. Transgressions do cause men to 

suffer. And even God will chastise man for committing them.<br>
<font color= "blue">
“My son, do not despise the chastening of the Lord, nor be discouraged 

when you are rebuked by Him; for whom the Lord loves He chastens, and 

scourges every son whom He receives.” (Heb 12:5–6)</font><br>

In dealing with sin, God does chastise. He does this in His role as 

Father, Creator, and Ruler. He knows how to show, in a benevolent way, 

that sin is bad for His children. God does chastise. On the other 

hand, He will not reckon any sins as being on man’s record books as 

far as His reconciliation with them is concerned. God dogmatically 

states, in regard to the world, that He is “not imputing their sins to 

them.” Still, like a father, God will correct His sons and the world 

for sins. At times He chastises severely.<br>Paul said that it was a 

fearful thing to fall into the hands of God <br>(Heb 10:26–27,31).<br> Still. 

God loves the world (John 3:16). He loves us so much that God sent 

Jesus Christ to die for us and to account for every sin.<br>And nothing 

will separate man from that love of God.<br>
<font color= "blue">
“For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor 

principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, 

nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature [creation], shall be 

able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our 

Lord.” (Rom 8:28–29)</font></p>
<p>

This message of reconciliation which God has accomplished for mankind 

is what Christians should be telling the world. <br>This is the Good News 

which Christ came to bring. God loves mankind supremely.<br> We should 

respond with real love for Him and His Son Jesus Christ and when we do, 

the reconciliation will be complete.
