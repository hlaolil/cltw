Unforgiving and Forgiving 
</h1>
<h3>
Unforgiving
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures. (James 4:3)</font></p>
<p>
Prayer with a wrong motive cannot be effective. Only prayer which is offered for the glory of God secures His ear and His answer.<br>
If we know of sin in our lives, prayer cannot be effective. We learn this from Psa 66:18. How easy it is to harbour sin! We need to pray the prayers that David prayed:  Psa 139:23-24; Psa 51:3-4, and act on 1 John 1:9.</p>
<p>
An unforgiving spirit will hinder prayer. <br>We learn this from Mark 11:25-26. Is this a possible reason why our prayers for the conversion of our loved ones are not being answered?<br>
An unwillingness to be reconciled to someone prevents prayer from being effective. We learn this from Matt 5:23-24. It is of little use to pray, worship, go to meetings, or engage in God's service and to expect His blessing, if we are unwilling first to be reconciled to another believer.</p>
<p>
A wrong relationship is a barrier in prayer. We learn this from 1 Peter 3:7. Perhaps our relationship with members of our own family is not all that it should be. According to this verse, that can be a hindrance to our prayers.</p>
<h3>
Forgiving
</h3>
<p>
In Peter’s day forgiveness was a three-times matter for the devout.  
<p><font color= "blue">
Then Peter came to Him and said, “Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?”
Jesus said to him, “I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven. <br> (Matt 18:21-22)</font></p>

<p>
Jesus presented a new playing field, with numbers too large to keep score: seventy-seven, or in some Biblical versions, seventy times seven, or four hundred-ninety, according to the Rev. Audrey Bell, who said that this Scripture has three different themes.</p>
<p>
First, forgiveness is always a personal matter (from personal experience) because pain is a personal matter. But at some time the hating must stop. When a person reaches this point, it is the moment of forgiveness.</p>
<p>
Second, forgiveness is essentially one-sided, a unilateral choice.<br> It is initiated by one party and it is often rejected by the second party. Forgiveness is not fair. It is mercy,. It does not negate justice, rather it relegates justice to a higher power.
However, when forgiveness is accepted by the second party it becomes two-sided. The result is reconciliation.</p>
<p>
Third, forgiveness is not merely a one time event. It must be repeated to develop a character of a committed lifestyle. Furthermore, it is not done in isolation. Other people are looking on.</p>
<p>
The goal of repeated forgiveness is not to make you feel good, but to develop spiritual formation. You will be transformed into a different person as your character becomes more reflective of God.</p>
<p>
A restored relationships is as strange as it is redemptive.</p>
