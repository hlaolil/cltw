The Fathers Communication
</h1>
<h3>
His Word 
</h3>
<p>
In order to actually "hear" from God, we have to know some things about God's character. We have to develop an understanding of who God is, and the way He does things. Fortunately for us, all that information is available in the Bible. The Book goes into a lot of detail about how you can expect God to react, what kinds of expectations He has for us, and most specifically, how He expects us to treat other people. It's actually a pretty good book, given its age.</p>
<h3>
Other People
</h3>
<p>
Many times God will use other people to try to get through to us. It's possible for God to use anyone at any time, but I find more messages coming from people who are practising Christians than non-practising ones.</p>
<h3>
Our Circumstances
</h3>
<p>
Sometimes the only way God can teach us something is to allow circumstances in our life to lead us to and through the very thing we need to discover. One of my favourite authors, Joyce Meyer, says, "There's no such thing as a drive-through break-through."</p>
<h3>
The Still Small Voice
</h3>
<p>
Most of the time God uses a tiny voice inside us to let us know when we're not on the right path. Some people call it "the voice of peace." Whenever we're contemplating something and we don't have peace about it, it's a very good idea to stop and carefully look at the options. There's a reason you don't feel peace about it.</p>
<h3>
The Actual Voice
</h3>
<p>
Sometimes we're able to "hear" something in our spirit that sounds to us like an actual audible voice. Or all of a sudden, you just know you heard something. Pay attention to those occasions because it is very likely God trying to tell you something.</p>
<h3>
When God Talks, Shut Up and Listen
</h3>
<p>
Let me give you an example. A couple years ago I signed up to become a hospital visitor for my church. When I first saw the notice in our church bulletin, I immediately felt that I should respond. But, I let it pass. Over the next couple of weeks, the thought occurred to me off and on so I said to myself, "If I see the notice in the bulletin this coming Sunday, I'll sign up."
Of course, it was in there. But this time when I saw it, there was no getting away from it. I finally had to say, "Okay, okay God, I'm going!"</p>
<p>
So there I was doing hospital visits for the first time. I was nervous, but I prayed a lot before I went, and I was doing okay. But on my way to the second hospital, I prayed again that God would use me to represent Him to all the sick people, giving comfort, etc.
Right in front of the hospital was a cross walk with a traffic light. As I stood at the corner I kept praying, starting to cross, even though the light was red. I mean, I was in a hurry trying to get to all those sick people!</p>
<p>
Right in the middle of the street I heard, "So you want to represent Me, and you can't even make it across the street without breaking the law?"
I was so shocked by this, I said the most spiritual thing I could think of, "Oops." </p>
<p>
God uses lots of things to talk to us. But actually hearing from God isn't so much a matter of if He's talking, but rather, whether we're listening.</p>
