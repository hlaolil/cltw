Biblical Meditation
</h1>
<h3>
Introduction
</h3>
<p>
Scripture declares God’s thoughts,
<font color= "blue">
“For My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways,” says the Lord. “For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are My ways higher than your ways, and My thoughts than your thoughts” (Isa 55:8-9).</font></p>
<p>
We are also told to <font color= "blue">“be of the same mind toward one another” (Rom 12:16)</font> which means essentially that we must develop and maintain the mind of Christ or God’s thoughts. We are to <font color= "blue">“stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel” (Phil 1:27)</font>.<br> But if my thoughts are contrary to God’s, then I must exchange my thinking with God’s and for that process, He has given us His inspired, inerrant, and authoritative Word. So what is our need? We are to study the Scripture, but for that to be effective, we also need to develop the art of biblical meditation.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you may observe to do according to all that is written in it; for then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will have good success. (Josh 4 1:8)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
But his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in His law he meditates day and night. (Psa 1:2) </font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
Be angry, and do not sin. Meditate within your heart on your bed, and be still. (Psa 4:4) </font></p>
<p>
If I were the devil, I would do my best to divide and fragment the thinking of the church of Jesus Christ. <br>I would try to get God’s people confused as to who they are and why they are here. I would try to get them preoccupied with other things. <br>I would try to get them to live independently, to think like the world thinks, to think like the natural man thinks <font color= "blue">in the futility of their mind (Eph 4:17-18)</font>.<br> In other words, I would like to keep people away from serious involvement with the Word of God. I would want to keep their relationship to God’s Word superficial and secondary. <br>Someone has said that the Adversary majors in three things: noise, hurry, and crowds. But he also has a number of cultural values or belief systems, actually illusions and snares, that he uses to confuse and manipulate the church so that it must, of necessity, fail in its calling and purpose whenever it operates under these illusions.</p>
<p>
Each of these are opposed to and work against developing and maintaining the mind of Christ through studying and meditating on the Word. <br>They are designed to keep us out of the Word which is so essential to our ability to avoid the delusions of Satan and the world system and to hear and respond to the call of God on our lives.</p>
<h3>
What Does It Mean to Meditate?
</h3>
<p>
The first question we must consider concerns the meaning of meditation and what meditation involves. <br>This is particularly important to the Christian because of the great and growing emphasis on meditation in eastern religions. Transcendental meditation, as it is often called, is not biblical meditation. It is dangerous and actually opens up one’s mind for Satanic attack as it is found in New Age thinking. <br>My purpose here is to deal only with the meaning and blessing of biblical meditation and to point out that eastern forms of meditation and biblical meditation are miles apart.
<h3>
The Actions of Meditation
</h3>
<p>
Meditation means “the act of focusing one’s thoughts: to ponder, think on, muse.” Meditation consists of reflective thinking or contemplation, usually on a specific subject to discern its meaning or significance or a plan of action.</p>
<p>
Some synonyms would be contemplation, reflection, rumination, deep thinking, or remembering in the sense of keeping or calling something to mind for the purpose of consideration, reflection, or meditation.<br> Compare for instance the following verses of Scripture:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
When I remember You on my bed, I meditate on You in the night watches, (Psa 63:6)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
I will remember the works of the Lord; surely I will remember Your wonders of old. (Psa 77:11)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
They did not remember His power: the day when He redeemed them from the enemy, (Psa 78:42) </font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
I remember the days of old; I meditate on all Your works; I muse on the work of Your hands. (Psa 143:5></font></p>
<h3>
The Objects of Meditation
</h3>
<p>
In Eastern forms of meditation as in TM (Transcendental meditation) there is an attempt to empty the mind. Biblical meditation, however, is an attempt to empty the mind of the wrong things in order to fill it with what is right and true according to the index of God’s inspired Word.</p>
<p>
All Eastern forms of meditation stress the need to become detached from the world. There is an emphasis upon losing person hood and individuality and merging with the Cosmic Mind. Detachment is the final goal of Eastern religion. It is an escaping from the miserable wheel of existence… It is merely a method of controlling the brain waves in order to improve your psychological and emotional well-being.</p>
<p>
Biblical meditation involves becoming detached from the controlling and hindering influences of the world and attached to the living God through Christ that we might, through faith and transformed values, experience the sufficiency of the Saviour and reach out to a hurting world in need of the living Christ.</p>
<p>
Biblical meditation is object oriented. It begins with reflective reading and rereading of the Word and is followed by reflection on what has been read and committed to memory. In Scripture, the word meditate is generally found with an object (God, His Word, or works, etc.) or in a context where the object of meditation is understood.</p>
<p>
In Scripture it does not mean to sit and ponder infinity or to empty the mind so some force can fill it by repeating some chant or mantra. Such is dangerous and opens the mind to demonic attack. Meditation in the Bible means reflective thinking on biblical truth so that God is able to speak to us through Scripture and through the thoughts that come to mind as we are reflecting on the Word, but that must also be filtered by the Word.</p>
<p>
The goal of Christian meditation is to internalise and personalise the Scripture so that its truth can affect how we think, our attitudes, and how we live, our actions.</p>
<h3>
The Objectives of Meditation
</h3>
<p>
<font size="+1">Worship—</font><br>
It is designed to focus on the Lord and His works (Psa 27:4; 77:12). <br>It is a place and space in our lives for communion with God. <br>It is a means of elevating the spiritual over the material world and the world of activity: the world of hustle and bustle and coming and going.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Instruction—</font><br>
It is designed to improve our understanding of the Word and God’s ways as it applies to our lives: <font color= "blue">meditation of my heart shall give understanding. <br>(Psa 49:3 119:27, 97f)</font>. In meditation we exchange our thoughts with God's.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Motivation or Encouragement—</font><br>
It is designed to motivate and inspire us in service and courage for the works God has called us to do (Josh 1:7-8)</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Transformation—</font><br>
It is designed to transform and change our lives. This would apply to all the above (Psa 4:4; 19:14; 119:15; Rom 12:2; Col 3:1f).</p>
<p>
In Joshua 1:8, God promised Joshua success as part of the fruit of his meditation on the Word, but this has nothing to do with the prosperity mentality of the positive thinking and eastern meditation that is so present today in New Age thinking where, through positive thinking, one is able to control his or her destiny. Rather this is the success of obedient and godly living which experiences God’s provision and deliverance from the enemies of this life. It is not a guarantee against trials and pain.</p>
<h3>
When Should We Meditate?
</h3>
<p>
At prescribes times set aside for Bible study and thinking on the Word <br> (Gen 24:63; Ps. 4:4; 27:4; 63:6; 77:6; 119:148). <br>It means making space in a special place for God and spiritual values.</p>
<p>
At all times throughout the day and night, as we face the varied situations of life. It involves the constant application of the Word through remembrance and reflective thinking (Josh 1:8).</p>
<h3>
Why Should We Meditate?
</h3>
<p>
Because of what the Bible is—Revelation from God. <br>In the Bible God has spoken and through this book God reveals Himself, reveals who and what man is, and what His plan for man consists of. <br>(Cf. Psa 19:7f; 2 Tim 3:16; 2 Peter 1:20-21; Isa 55:8f.)</p>
<p>
The Bible was given to us by God to be read and meditated on. <br>“An unread Bible is like food that is refused, an unopened love letter, a buried sword, a road map not studied, a gold mine not worked.”</p>
<p>
Because of what man is and needs—Reconciliation to God and one another. The nature of man and the nature of the world and Satan constitutes a great need for personalising the Word: (cf. Eph 4:16f; 5:15f; 2 Cor 4:4; etc.)<br> Because man is a holistic being, his spiritual, psychological, and physical faculties are complexly intertwined.</p>
<p>
Meditation affects man’s whole being. Another reason is the fact man does not innately contain God’s thoughts and ways. </p>
<p>
Because of what the meditation does—Reformation of the mind and life.<br> Using the words “meditate” and “remember” which is sometimes used as a synonym for meditate (Psa 63:6; 77:5-7; 119:55-56; 143:5-6), let’s note from Scripture some of the reasons we should meditate on the Word.</p>
<p>
It renews or reprograms our minds, exchanges our ideas for God’s, so we can begin to experience God’s ways (Isa 55:8f; Rom 12:1). <br>Its the principle of GIGO or VIVO (garbage in, garbage out, or value in, value out).<br>
It monitors what and how we are thinking and thus protects us against the thinking and actions of the world (Psa 1:1-2; Jer 17:5-10). <br>Many of our problems are symptoms of underlying dynamic mental processes going on inside.<br> Meditating on the Word when done properly is designed to expose an often unconscious network of defences, anxieties, and sources of self-trust <br>(Heb 4:12; 2 Tim 3:16).<br>
It enables and motivates us to walk after or according to God’s plan and purposes rather than our own (Josh 1:7f; Psa 119:15).<br>
It produces spiritual stability and fruitfulness or success according to biblical standards (Josh 1:7f; Psa 1:3).<br>
It is a means of focusing on and resting in the Lord which enables us to cling to the Lord and find spiritual joy in the midst of suffering and testing <br>(Psa 63:6f; 77:6-12). <br>It becomes a means of protection against a mental attitude of self-pity and discouragement (Psa 4:4; 119:23, 78).<br>
It is a means of better knowing and understanding the Word which gives insight to life itself (Psa 49:3; 119:27).<br>
It warms the heart and keeps us close to God (Jer 20:7-9).<br>
It is a means of worship and seeking God which is ultimately the highest goal of meditation (Psa 27:4; 77:12).<br>
May we join the Psalmist who, rather than use the methods of the world to deal with his pain, declared his commitment to meditation when he wrote:<br>
<font color= "blue">
Let the proud be ashamed, for they treated me wrongfully with falsehood; but I will meditate on Your precepts. (Psa 119:78) </font></p>
<h3>
The Art of Meditation
</h3>
<p>
How to Profit From Biblical Meditation:
Biblical meditation is the art of reflection, of pondering and going over a matter in one’s mind. <br>It is important that we recognise we cannot divorce meditation from all the processes by which we learn and apply the Word. <br>It is intricately tied to Bible study in all its forms.</p>
<p>
Biblical meditation involves the whole process of reading and observing a portion of Scripture in order to seek both its meaning and application. <br>Though we generally think in terms of the final aspect in which one reflects on his observations and understanding of a particular text or concept of the Word, reading the text of Scripture reflectively is a part of the process of biblical meditation.</p>
<p>
The point is this. We can’t effectively reflect on and respond to a portion of the Word or a biblical truth without the whole process of careful Bible study. Just as meditating in a vacuum or to empty the mind as it is done in eastern religions is dangerous and may open the mind to demonic attack, so meditating on error drawn from a misunderstanding of a passage can lead to unhappy results.</p>
<p>
There are three things that must go together in biblical meditation:<br> Reading, Reflecting, and Responding. The ultimate purpose of these three are the three great purposes of Bible study:</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Observation—</font><br>
What does the text say?</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Interpretation—</font><br>
What does the text mean?</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Application—</font><br>
How does the text apply to my life?</p>
<h3>
Reading
</h3>
<p>
Careful reading for observation comes first. The word “read” or “reading” occurs 80 times in Scripture, 34 times in the New Testament.<br> This involves the following:</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Read Reverently</font><br>
Ever mindful that you are reading the Word of God.<br> The Bible is God breathed and each word and sentence has a purpose and function. This means reading deliberately, slowly, and alertly, not mechanically or legalistically.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Read Repeatedly </font><br>
Going over and over the passage to observe more and more knowing that you do not exhaust the meaning of any verse even when it becomes familiar and you think you know it. There are always new observations to be seen or mined as a miner searches for silver or gold (Prov 2:4).</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Read Creatively </font><br>
Visualising yourself in the time, history, and situation of the passage as much as possible to experience a feel for what the author and the people of his day were experiencing. “Precisely because God chose to speak in the context of real human history, we may take courage that these same words will speak again and again in our own real history, as they have throughout the history of the church.”</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Read With Study Tools In Hand </font><br>
With paper and pen and Bible study helps at your finger tips to help you observe and answer your questions. So we need to use tools like a Concordance, Commentaries, Bible Dictionary, Atlas, and Word Study Helps like Vine’s Expository Dictionary of New Testament Words, Revel, or New Testament Words, by William Barclay, SCM Press, or A Treasury of New Testament Synonyms, by Stewart Custer, Bob Jones University Press.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Read to Understand</font><br>
Read purposely, to make observations of the text that will help you understand its meaning. This means asking questions like our six important friends in Bible study, who, what, when, where, why, and how.<br>
Of course, such reading requires constant reflection and pondering over the text you are reading. This brings us to our next point in the process of meditation, reflection.</p>
<h3>
Reflection
</h3>
<p>
Irving Jensen writes, “Reflection is the mind and heart at work, thinking over and concentrating on what the eyes have seen ... Reflection in Bible reading should have the intensity of meditation, whereby the soul has the desire and intention of obeying God’s Word.”<br>
So, how can we read the Bible like this? Jensen suggest the following which I have summarised as follows:</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Reflect Purposely </font><br>
To fulfil the biblical objectives of meditation—worship, instruction, motivation, transformation. As the Psalmist who prayed: <font color= "blue">
“I will meditate on Your precepts, and contemplate Your ways” (Psa 119:15)</font>
, and again, <font color= "blue">
“Make me understand the way of Your precepts, So shall I meditate on Your  wonderful works” <br>(Psa 119:27)</font>
.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Reflect Imaginatively</font><br> 
Visualise the setting and put yourself there. Try to feel the burden, the concern, the fear, the love, etc. Seek to taste and feel every word you read.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Reflect Humbly</font><br>
 Realising that you are not reading just a book, but that which is the very Word from God, God-breathed and authoritative, alive and powerful. It should truly humble us to know that in the Bible, the Holy One who is also the Almighty One, has spoken to us in the Bible.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Reflect Prayerfully </font><br>
Trusting the Spirit of God to open up your eyes and heart to see, understand, and respond to the Word. <br>Again, read as the Psalmist who prayed: <font color= "blue">“Open my eyes, that I may see wondrous things from Your law.” (Psa 119:18)</font>. This is also the position of humility and respect. <br>God’s Word is a spiritual book requiring spiritual perception.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Reflect Patiently </font><br>
Expectantly, waiting on the Lord to teach you and show you. Time and patience are important elements to effective meditation and examination of the Word. Again remember that the great enemies of meditating on the Word are noise, hurry, and crowds. Thus, the Psalmist, looking for insight to God’s Word and direction in his life prayed,<font color= "blue"> “Lead me in Your truth and teach me, for You are the God of my salvation;on You I wait all the day” (Psa 25:5)</font>.</p>
<p>
The purpose of reading and reflecting on Scripture is response, responding and applying the passage to our own lives. So we naturally turn to the third aspect of meditation and the ultimate purpose of the Word. The call to reflection in Bible reading is expressed in Samuel’s plain words to Saul, <font color= "blue">
“But you stand here awhile, that I may announce to you the word of God.” (1 Sam 9:27)</font>
