The Word of God

<h2>
Living a righteous life
</h2>
<p><font color= "blue">
“But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh in regard to its lusts.” (Rom 13:14)</font>.(see also Luke 21:34-36)</p>
<p>
The righteous life is putting on Jesus like a suit of clothes. It is abiding in Him and living out His life. <br>Paul instructs us to “make no provision for the flesh in regard to its lusts.” <br>The term that is rendered “provision” implies forethought, planning, and activity and most of the time it is premeditated.<br> Sin is a link in a chain of events. When we surrender to the lusts of our flesh, it is often not a sudden collapse, but rather the culmination of a process. <br>The sins of our flesh are those sins about which we have given much thought and for which we have made provision. If we are to be victorious over sin and the flesh, we must cease to make provision for it.
<p>
Rom 13:14 has the power to set you free from a life of sin. <br>Today, put on the Lord Jesus Christ. Ask Him to help you overcome your sin. Make no provision for whatever sin is plaguing your flesh. <br>Stop gratifying your flesh; instead, gratify your inner man with Jesus.<br> You have dual citizenship. You are a citizen of earth, but you are a pilgrim, a sojourner who is just travelling through. You are on your way to your heavenly home because you are first and foremost a citizen of heaven. <br>So act like it! Jesus has given you all the power you need.
<h2>
The Will of God
</h2>
<p><font color= "blue">
For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you should abstain from sexual immorality; that each of you should know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honour, (1 Thess 4:3-4)</font><br>(see also 1 Cor 9:27, Rom 8:12-13)
<h3>
Abstain from Immorality 
</h3>
<p>
“... for (that) you to keep away (avoid, abstain) from sexual immorality ...” <br>The first instruction is general and is designed to produce greater holiness through avoiding sexual immorality. Paul called his readers to avoid it, pointing to the need for exercising self-discipline as enabled by God’s Spirit.

“Keep away from”, “to hold back, keep off, be distant.” In the middle voice as used here, it means “to hold oneself from, avoid.” The middle voice draws attention to the subject’s personal participation in the action on himself with vested interest. This stresses personal responsibility along with the benefits that will result in pleasing God and protecting ourselves from sin and avoiding its consequences (see 1 Thess 4:6-8).</p>
<p>
“Sexual immorality,” is broad and includes all forms of illegitimate sexual practices. 
While sexual immorality means primarily traffic with harlots, ... it may denote any form of illicit sexual relationship. <br>But “immorality” is too vague a rendering. In some New Testament passages sexual immorality appears to have a more general sense. <br>Christianity from the outset has sanctified sexual union within marriage (as in Judaism); outside marriage it was forbidden. </p>
<p>This was a strange notion in the pagan society to which the gospel was first brought; there various forms of extramarital sexual union were tolerated and some were even encouraged. A man might have a mistress who could provide him also with intellectual companionship; the institution of slavery made it easy for him to have a concubine, while casual gratification was readily available from a harlot.<br> There was no body of public opinion to discourage sexual immorality and certain forms of public religion, indeed, involved ritual sexual immorality. <br>In Thessalonica it was sanctioned by the cult of Cabiri of Samothrace. </p>
<p>
Thus, by calling for believers to keep away from fornication, Paul had in mind all the particular social conditions to which these believers were susceptible in Greece stemming from their past history as idolaters.<br> The Thessalonians lived in a pagan environment in which sexual looseness was not only practised openly but was also encouraged. In Greek religion, prostitution was considered a priestly prerogative, and extramarital sex was sometimes an act of worship.<br> But to a Christian the will of God is clear: holiness and sexual immorality are mutually exclusive. No appeal to Christian liberty can justify fornication.</p>
<p>
Christians are to avoid and abstain from any and every form of sexual practice that lies outside the circle of God’s revealed will; Christians are to avoid adultery, premarital and extramarital intercourse, homosexuality, and other perversions.
<h3>
Know how to possess your Vessel 
</h3>
<p>
In these verses, the Apostle moves from the general to the specific and from the positive to the negative.<br> A great deal of debate exists regarding the meaning of 1 Thess 4:4 with two interpretations being prominent. The debate concerns the meaning of “vessel”. Taking “vessel” to refer figuratively to one’s own body, some interpret verse 4 to mean, “learn how to control one’s own body with its sexual passions since our own bodies are our vessels” (2 Cor 4:7; 2 Tim 2:20-21).<br> How to do this is not explained by the Apostle. “Know” may refer to knowledge learned from the Word or the revelation of God. This would be a command to learn and apply what God’s Word says about self-control of one’s body and sexual urges through the control of the Spirit (1 Thess 4:8) and the Word filled life.</p>
<p>
But a second and equally prominent view holds this clause to mean that believers are to learn how to acquire a wife or husband and live with one’s spouse in the sanctity of marriage. In this view, the verse is dealing with one’s approach to and maintenance of the marriage relationship according to the teaching of Scripture.<br>
Clearly, one way to avoid sexual impurity is through marriage and a proper understanding of sex and marriage as God designed it.<br> This is particularly true for Paul’s audience due to the cultural climate of Greece. This does not depreciate a woman’s position in marriage as just a vessel to satisfy sexual desires as 1 Thess 4:4b-5 illustrate, and because, in the final analysis, the principles are applicable to both men and women in their approach to marriage.</p>
<p>
1 Thess 4:4b then points us to positive biblical attitude that must guard and guide one’s approach into marriage, “in sanctification and honour.”<br> 

With the clause, “in sanctification and honour,” the preposition “in” points us to the sphere or controlling atmosphere that is to surround, control, and guide the process of courtship, entrance into and maintenance of the marriage relationship whether man or woman.</p>
<p>
As mentioned previously, “sanctification” basically means “set apartness,” a state of “holiness.” It refers to the progressive aspect of sanctification, the process of being set apart to the Lord and His purposes and plan. <br>Marriage must be entered and maintained by the principles of Scripture.</p> 
<p>
“Honour” is time which means “a valuing, a price paid or received,” then “esteem, preciousness, respect.” Marriage must be entered and maintained in an atmosphere of respect for it is a special and holy creation and institution of God. It is not just a convenience or a means of power or position or an excuse for sex. It is a life-long commitment of two people committed to ministry and love wherein they seek to complement and complete each other.</p>
<h2>
Watch how you Walk
</h2>
<p>
Be considerate. <br>Paul writes,<font color= "blue"> “It is good not to eat meat or to drink wine, or to do anything by which your brother stumbles.” (Rom 14:21)</font>(see also Luke 17:1-2)</p>
<p>
Paul urges the “strong” to abstain, not because their example might lead the “weak” to drink to excess, but because their example might lead the “weak” to drink, and thus to violate their consciences (Rom 14:22-23).<br> Paul himself is willing to forego any particular food or drink to avoid causing spiritual growth problems for a brother. Certainly we should be willing to do the same.<br> We willingly alter our pace of walking while leading a small child by the hand so he or she will not stumble. How much more should we be willing to alter our Christian walk for the benefit of a weaker brother or sister in Christ whom we are leading? <br>We must learn the sensitivities of other believers and we must respect differing convictions. Liberty must be limited by love.</p>
<p>
However, I do think it is a healthy thing for a Christian who has liberty in some of these areas to indulge it on occasion. I do not think the cause of Christ is ever advanced by having every strong Christian in a congregation completely forsake their right to indulge in some of the things God has given them the freedom to enjoy.<br> What happens, then, is that the whole question is settled on the basis of the most narrow and most prejudiced person in the congregation. Soon, the gospel itself becomes identified with that kind of view. <br>That is why the outside world often considers Christians to be narrow-minded people who have no concern except to prevent the enjoyment of the good gifts of life that God has given us. <br>Because we tend to major on the minors, we’re known for what we’re against, not what we’re for. Ultimately, exercising Christian liberty is very much like walking a tightrope. As you walk the rope with balancing pole in hand, at one end of the pole is love for others and at the other is Christian liberty.<br> When these are in balance, your walk is as it should be
