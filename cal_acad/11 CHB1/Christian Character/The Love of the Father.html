   <h1>
The Love of the Father
</h1>
<p>
The apostle Paul is quite clear when he says, <font color= "blue">"God demonstrates His own love for us in that, while we were still sinners, Christ died for us." (Rom 5:8)</font> <br>The death of Jesus is the demonstration that God does indeed love us.<br> If we believe that God the Father sent His eternally beloved Son to lay down His life for hell-deserving sinners like ourselves, then we will understand that God has done this merely because of His love for us. <br>When we grasp this truth:</p>
<p>
1. We will think about God the Father in the right way and worship Him more joyfully. He is the One who orchestrated and commanded redemption. <br>It is not only the Son of God who loved us and gave Himself for us. <br>God the Father has loved us and sent His Son to die for us. <br>The Apostle John is almost paralysed by the greatness of this truth when he declares, <font color= "blue">"Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God." (1 John 3:1)</font></p>
<p>
2. We will think about the relationship between God the Father and God the Son in the right way. The members of the Godhead are in perfect, unbroken, undivided unity with each other. <br>The Father commands, the Son willingly consents and obeys.<br> There is no tension in the purposes of God. What the Father does, the Son does in like manner. <br>Jesus Himself said,<font color= "blue"> "Therefore My Father loves Me, because I lay My life down that I may take it again. No one takes it from Me. I lay it down of Myself. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This command I have received from My Father" (John 10:17-18)</font>.<br> God the Father commanded the Son to lay down His life willingly and to take it again on His own. The Son willingly submitted to the Father's command for Him to willingly lay down His life and take it again.<br> This shows infinitely perfect harmony in the purpose of the Persons in the Godhead.</p>
<p>
3. We will rejoice and rest in the fact that God the Father has always and will always love us. "The best proof that He will never cease to love us lies in that He never began." <br>Knowing that God the Father was never constrained--even by His infinitely lovely Son--to love you, but that He did so merely based on His good pleasure, is the greatest source of assurance. <br>This is Paul's main point in Romans 5:6-11 where he explains what the Father did for us to show us His love for us. In this way we will escape a "He loves me, He loves me not" mentality. <br>In short, this biblical truth will help build our assurance more than any other. </p>
