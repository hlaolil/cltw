He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. 9 That was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world. (John 1:8-9)</font>
John has in mind unbelievers who see themselves as sinless. This is an impossibility this side of glory. If they had truly been in the "light," the light would continually expose their sinfulness!

The Holy Spirit is constantly revealing our sin and God's holiness to us. We continue to <font color= "blue">grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ (2 Peter 3:18)</font>.

An example may help: As one gets closer and closer to a bright light, the more things are exposed. For instance, as more light is added to a room, dust that was on the dinning room table all along becomes more visible and prominent. Items that could not be seen before come into sharper focus. In a similar way, the closer we get to Christ (who is light - John 1:8-9; 8:12; 1 John 1:5), the more we discover that we are far greater sinners than we had ever thought. The closer our relationship with God, the more our sin will be in the light. This will cause the true Christian grief and result in repentance (2 Cor 7:10). True Christians live lives of ongoing repentance (2 Tim 2:24-26). Is this not different from how we were before Christ? Is this not evidence of our election?</p>

Persons who thinks they no longer sin no longer have a need to preach the gospel to themselves. This is evidence of their condition; they are lost. These false professors of light deceive themselves and remain in darkness. The Greek suggests an active rejection of the truth rather than simple misconception: "The truth is not in [them]." Thus they are not saved (cf. 1 John 2:4; 5:6). In denying their sins they also deny their need for the forgiveness found in Christ and thus reject the truth of the gospel. </p>

Let us leave this issue with an incident recounted about Charles Haddon Spurgeon, the great Baptist preacher of the last century. Perhaps few other Christians in heaven will have such a long queue of preachers apologising for having told so many apocryphal stories about them! Be that as it may, it is said that Spurgeon was once confronted by a man who claimed to be "without sin". Intrigued, the preacher invited him home to dinner. After hearing the claims through, he picked up his glass of water and threw it in the man's face. Understandably, the visitor was highly indignant and expressed himself very forcefully to the preacher about his lack of courtesy. To which the wise man replied, "Ah, you see, the old man within you is not dead. He had simply fainted and could be revived with a glass of water!"

If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. (1 John 1:9)</font>

When we place our trust in Christ, we are justified and forgiven in the court of heaven itself (Rom 5:1; 1 John 2:12). In this ultimate sense, the final destiny of true believers does not depend on their confessing sins day by day. Even so, we do not experience the full benefits of our justification this side of glory. As a result, true believers sin and therefore are in need of the experience of continual forgiveness from God (a gift - 2 Tim 2:24-26). They enjoy God's blessing rather than His temporary discipline (Heb 12:5-11) when they readily acknowledge their sins before him. Therefore, "The proper Christian attitude to sin is not to deny it but to admit it, and then to receive the forgiveness which God has made possible and promises to us."</p>
<p>
Repeated and unrelenting rebellion against God may indicate that a person does not have saving faith, but those who genuinely trust Christ for salvation will heed John's call for confession. 

God is faithful and just. This is the believer's full assurance. God is faithful with respect to all his promises (Deut 32:4). He is the one who has the power to forgive and who does forgive his people their sins (Jer 31:34; Heb 8:12; 10:17). Even in the Old Testament we observe God's call to the church to be forgiven: <font color= "blue">"Come now, let us reason together says the Lord, Though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red as crimson, they shall be like wool" (Isa 1:18)</font>.
<p>
If we confess our sins, acknowledging before God that we are sinners not only by nature (sin) but by practice also (our sins), God will both forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. In the first phrase sin is a debt which He remits and in the second a stain which He removes. In both He is said to be faithful and just. The first word may mean that He is faithful to His nature and character (cf. 2 Tim. 2:13). But the faithfulness of God in Scripture is constantly associated with His covenant promises (e.g. Psa 89; Heb 10:23). He is true to His word and faithful to His covenant. Since the new covenant includes the pledge,<font color= "blue"> "I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.‚Äù (Jer 31:34)</font>, it is not difficult to see why God is said to be 'faithful' in forgiving our sins.</p>
