 <h1>
Lack of Knowledge Destroys 
</h1>
<>p
Among the most chilling words of the Bible are these: <font color= "blue">"My people are destroyed from lack of knowledge ..." (Hosea 4:6)</font> </p>
<p>
Note that these words were addressed to God's own people, to people who were utterly convinced they were saved. <br>
Yet "God's people" of old failed to heed the repeated commands of God and warnings from the prophets. And for their lack of urgency, they met a disastrous end!</p> 
<p>
But perhaps the most tragic corollary to all of this is: It was entirely avoidable. 
Think about it: They did not have to suffer the truly horrific catastrophe that befell them. 
Perhaps the root cause of Israel's destruction was thinking they were doing the right thing.</p>
<h3>
Complacency 
</h3>
<p>
Being complacent was apparently among the root causes of Israel's downfall. The prophet Amos wrote: "Woe to you who are complacent in Zion..." (Amos 6:1-6) 
Yes, it was a seemingly harmless sin of omission that sealed their fate. A sin of lukewarmness. A blundered-upon path to not seek, in honesty, the full will of their God—the One they were certain would deliver them. 

And this spiritual complacency affected their desire to eagerly gain knowledge of God's word. Moses warned them to "FULLY OBEY the LORD" and "CAREFULLY FOLLOW ALL HIS COMMANDS" and "PAY ATTENTION to the commands of the LORD..." (Deut 28:1,13). But they did not heed his warnings. 

The words "fully obey" and "carefully follow ALL" and "pay attention" had long ago escaped their consideration of importance. Otherwise, they never would have allowed their knowledge to wane! </p>

Indeed, like many today, they had written off any message except what was comfortable to them. 
I wonder: Are we paying attention to their example of destruction? 
Are we taking their same perilous path, casting aside warnings of our obvious failures? 
Have we too become so complacent that we have "closed our eyes, ears, hearts, and minds" to any examination of current "truth"—due to our "certainty" of Biblical correctness and ultimate salvation? (Isa 6:8-10; Matt 13:14-16; 1 Cor 10:12) </p>
<h3>
Lack of Knowledge of God
</h3>
<p>
Systemic knowledge failure typically leads to "religion evolution" 

I cannot possibly stress enough the importance of growing in knowledge—and then SHARING that knowledge, no matter who you are, with saved and unsaved alike. With all who will listen. (Hebrews 5:12-14) 

I once heard a preacher say something like this: "I've never been able to successfully teach someone who didn't want to learn." 

Israel was destroyed because they didn't want to learn God's true will. 

But perhaps more fundamental to their failure was their complacency. It was their lack of will to learn, undoubtedly driven by the false belief that their current knowledge was acceptable. 

Israel's "religion" had evolved, just as with many churches we see around us these days. There is an inversely proportional relationship between "accurate, honest, Biblical knowledge" and "one's sense of spiritual 'maturity' and tolerance to sin." 
As one's knowledge of God's will diminishes, a false sense of "spiritual maturity" often increases. 
Such intelligent but woefully misled Christian people learn to develop a "tolerant attitude" toward many evils of society, including false teaching and false religions. 
They no longer understand the wisdom of God's command to "abhor what is evil; cling to what is good." (Rom 12:9) 

We too must abhor evil: both in our own lives, and in the world. But the "evil" we must abhor and the "good" we must love should be per God's definitions, not man's. 
For man's definitions of good and evil are distorted.</p>
