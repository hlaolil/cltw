"But we were gentle among you, just as a nursing mother cherishes her own children ... as you know how we exhorted, and comforted, and charged every one of you, as a father does his own children, that you would walk worthy of God who calls you into His own kingdom and glory"(1 Thess 2:7,11-12)</font> 
1 Thess 2 is a compact, yet example-rich teaching on the qualities identifying not just a legitimate spiritual leader, but a good one. It's not intended to inflate the resumes of the true leaders, but is a necessary laundry list by which false and bad leaders can be identified. Paul's first paragraph on the subject in 1 Thess 2:1-8 are summarised in the qualities of a mother, and in the second paragraph covering verses 1 Thess 2:9-12 by the qualities of a father. True leaders don't have "followers" or "congregants" (church members) or even "disciples", they have "children".</p>

This is one of the places where it's simply not enough to be a master of God's Word, but shows how a leader is supposed to apply their ministry of that Word. Extraordinarily gifted in the Word or having accumulated impeccable credentials is not enough for God's true minister; they have to apply that wisdom in the same manner that Christ did. Have you noticed how often Christ tenderly cared for those who required it, but also exhorted those needing encouragement as well? The dual nature of a mother's tenderness and a father's accountability are both found in His example for us.</p>
<p>
Earthly parents desire their children to become good citizens in general and to eventually reflect to the next generation what the parents invested of themselves. Likewise, spiritual parents have as their goal that their children should "walk in a manner worthy of the God who calls you". They have to recognise when a spiritual boo-boo needs a mother's healing touch as opposed to a serious miscue requiring a father's firm hand of accountability.</p>

I would suggest that this is difficult at best, if not outright impossible, within the structure of most church organisations today. This requires something much more than seeing each other an hour or so once a week, and can't be achieved as long as one party is always on one side of the pulpit from the other. The biblical example of fellowship requires an actual relationship which spans the days of each week and month, a commitment that more resembles daily family interaction than a quarterly board of review</p>
