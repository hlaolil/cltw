Unforgiving and Forgiving

Unforgiving
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
You ask and do not receive, because you ask amiss, that you may spend it on your pleasures. (James 4:3)</font></p>
<p>
Prayer with a wrong motive cannot be effective. Only prayer which is offered for the glory of God secures His ear and His answer.
If we know of sin in our lives, prayer cannot be effective. We learn this from Psa 66:18. How easy it is to harbour sin! We need to pray the prayers that David prayed  Psa 139:23-24; Psa 51:3-4, and act on 1 John 1:9.
An unforgiving spirit will hinder prayer. We learn this from Mark 11:25-26. Is this a possible reason why our prayers for the conversion of our loved ones are not being answered?
An unwillingness to be reconciled to someone prevents prayer from being effective. We learn this from Matt 5:23-24. It is of little use to pray, worship, go to meetings, or engage in God's service and to expect His blessing, if we are unwilling first to be reconciled to another believer.
A wrong relationship is a barrier in prayer. We learn this from 1 Peter 3:7. Perhaps our relationship with members of our own family is not all that it should be. According to this verse, that can be a hindrance to our prayers.</p>

Forgiving
</h3>
<p>
In Peter’s day forgiveness was a three-times matter for the devout.  
<p><font color= "blue">
Then Peter came to Him and said, “Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?”
Jesus said to him, “I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven.  (Matt 18:21-22)</font></p>

<p>
Jesus presented a new playing field, with numbers too large to keep score: seventy-seven, or in some Biblical versions, seventy times seven, or four hundred-ninety, according to the Rev. Audrey Bell, who said that this Scripture has three different themes.</p>
<p>
First, forgiveness is always a personal matter (from personal experience) because pain is a personal matter. But at some time the hating must stop. When a person reaches this point, it is the moment of forgiveness.</p>
<p>
Second, forgiveness is essentially one-sided, a unilateral choice. It is initiated by one party and it is often rejected by the second party. Forgiveness is not fair. It is mercy,. It does not negate justice, rather it relegates justice to a higher power.
However, when forgiveness is accepted by the second party it becomes two-sided. The result is reconciliation.</p>
<p>
Third, forgiveness is not merely a one time event. It must be repeated to develop a character of a committed lifestyle. Furthermore, it is not done in isolation. Other people are looking on.</p>
<p>
The goal of repeated forgiveness is not to make you feel good, but to develop spiritual formation. You will be transformed into a different person as your character becomes more reflective of God.</p>
<p>
A restored relationships is as strange as it is redemptive.</p>
