The Father is Tough

“Today’s parents seem to have absorbed the notion that a child’s life should be totally serene, totally self-expressive and totally free from frustration. But creating an atmosphere that feels satisfactory to the child all the time does them a disservice.”</p>

Polishing rough stones into gems
</h3>
<p>
The solution is simple. More parents need to be as parents of old—like our parents and their parents before them. Most parents knew they were not around to be their children’s best friend. Their job was to nurture them with a firm hand. Sure, there would be friction, but friction is how you turn rough stones into polished gems. In Proverbs we read, <font color= "blue">The rod and rebuke give wisdom, but a child left to himself brings shame to his mother” (Prov 29:15)</font></p>
<p>
<font color= "blue">“Correct your son, and he will give you rest; yes, he will give delight to your soul.(Prov 29:17)</font>.</p>

Years ago, most parents knew kids needed a set of moral boundaries, and they should face the consequences when they stepped outside those boundaries. They knew kids needed chores. They needed set times for family dinner, for bedtime, for waking in the morning and preparing for school. They needed structure.<br>
So, why do we think we need to be soft toward those who require chastening? God says chastening is for our profit (Heb 12:5-11). Today’s mush love psyche has practically wiped out the sensible understanding of biblical tough love. God’s tough love splashed over the pages of both Testaments has been deleted as simply not fitting in with today’s “modern” ideologies, especially with regards to child rearing.
And yet we desperately love our children and want the best for them. Then why is it we cannot see the truth in,<font color= "blue"> “He who spares his rod hates his son, but he who loves him disciplines him promptly” (Prov 13:24)</font></p>
<h3>
Tough love in the Garden of Eden
</h3>
<p>
Look at the example of God’s love toward his first child, Adam. He had great plans for him. He talked to Adam about everything and told him how much He loved him. God expected Adam to look after the garden and name all the animals. Then God made Eve. They had much freedom and great joy in the garden and enjoyed a wonderful relationship with God, just as our own children do in our homes.
But, like any loving parent, God made rules for Adam and Eve. They had access to all the trees in the garden but one. They must have had certain chores. So what happened? Eve took of the forbidden fruit and Adam followed suit. Do you think God said, “Didn’t I already tell you not to do it? Just don’t let it happen again” That sounds more like us, doesn’t it? But God only speaks once. Mankind had to know God meant what He said. So the penalty was carried out, not because He did not love them but because He did. Without further ado, Adam and Eve were escorted out of their beautiful home to make their way in the world. They were introduced to a rough existence, which required labour for survival.
A little further down the line we see when God saw that the wickedness of man was great upon the earth, He decided to destroy His human creation (Gen 6:5-7). Yet the people were given an opportunity to change before the punishment was meted out. Then the judgement was made against Sodom and Gomorrah. This was also the case in Nineveh, but repentance occurred and a loving Father reversed the decision.
Many might argue things have changed under the New Testament administration, that Jesus Christ brought only a gospel of love, mercy and forgiveness. God does not change (Mal:3:6). Jesus Christ is also the God of the Old Testament. And God loves His children so much He was willing to die for them. He is also willing to use tough love to bring about a glorious end result.
Jesus was not weak when it came to discipline within His Church. Remember the story of Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5:1-11) God knew that “Because the sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.” (Eccl 8:11).</p>

Society’s view on tough love
</h3>
<p>
A member of the Canadian Parliament and a medical doctor, say, “Using force is a responsible way to discipline children but it must not go beyond reasonable force ... Spanking and disciplining in this manner has been part of parenting for centuries. I do not believe that the social engineers and interfering law-makers of today know better than the generations of parents who reared their children using spanking.”
But, for the most part, we have lost sight of what’s right and wrong. “As a signatory of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, Canada is obligated to make periodic appearances before the United	Nation's Committee on Rights of the Child, which said the country should adopt legislation to remove the existing authorisation of the use of “reasonable force” in disciplining children,”.
We can see the results of our namby-pamby approach to wrongdoing in escalating crime, violence in schools and deteriorating families.
Biblical tough love, however, is based on eternal truth. Anything less than tough love won’t get the job done. After all, Jesus was God. Can we do any less than Jesus Christ when it comes to tough love? He knew His plan would take a great deal of love and a great deal of getting tough. I think we need to appreciate the exquisite balance of God’s mercy, love and justice in His dealings with each and every one of us. Yet in the end He promises us, <font color= "blue">“He who overcomes shall inherit all things, and I will be his God and he shall be My son” (Rev 21:7)</font>. God speed that day!
