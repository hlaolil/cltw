The Fathers Acceptance
</h3>

The Lord your God in your midst, the Mighty One, will save; He will rejoice over you with gladness, He will quiet you with His love, He will rejoice over you with singing (Zeph 3:17)</font>.</p>
<h3>
Does God Love and Rejoice over you with Gladness?
</h3>
<p>
"When God thinks of you, love swells in His heart." I can imagine the thoughts going through your mind as you reflect on that statement.<br> For many of us, this idea is hard to accept. Do you really believe God loves you, even delights in you? If you are a follower of Christ you will probably give me the politically correct answer and say, "Yes. I believe He does." <br>However, most of us will respond to that statement perhaps with a "Well, yes, but ...". It is hard for us to believe God loves us without adding a "but" after the statement. The very statement challenges our theology about God. <br>Many of us associate the nature of God with holiness, judgement, and righteousness. Our first cognitive association with that statement will be based on beliefs and conclusions we have formed from our individual life experiences. <br>The opening verse from Zephaniah reveals the true heart of God toward us.<br> He rejoices over us with gladness, love, and singing!<br> The psalmist says "How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God! How great is the sum of them!"</p>
<p>
I'll be honest with you. When I first heard that opening statement, I found it hard to grasp. "Yes, I believe that God loves me if I have been good and not sinned." Or, maybe I might think, "Yes, I guess I can believe that sometimes." Or, "Well, you don't know how much I've failed God." <br>That one statement can reveal how much we've all been impacted by shame and our need to perform to gain love.</p>
<p>
In my own experience, deep down I didn't really believe God loved me without conditions. Part of me required me to earn that love.<br> Our actions often determine what we really believe about God, don't they? <br>Our ability to see God as an unconditionally loving Heavenly Father is formed by many factors-our earthly father, the type of parenting we received growing up, and the wounds we received as a child. The type of church experience we've had also impacts our beliefs. These factors determine whether our view of God is rooted in love as opposed to fear, performance, shame or legalism.</p>
<h3>
Why did God create man
</h3>
<p>
If I were to do a survey of the average Christian and ask why God created man, my guess is the answers would be as follows:</p>

<p> To worship God.</p>

<p> To evangelise the whole world.</p>

<p> To work on His behalf.</p>
<p>
I doubt the first answer would be to have friendship and intimacy with God Himself. It simply is not our first line of thinking. We have been trained to worship, to fulfil the great commission, and to work for Him.<br> Don't get me wrong, all of this is important. However, by missing the core reason for His creating you and me, we miss the core motivation for what we do. Our Christian life becomes defined by what we do and how well we do it, instead of how well we know the Creator and His motivation for creating us in the first place.<br> Activity should come as a result of the relationship, not the other way around.</p>
<p>
Winning the lost and impacting the world is the fruit of the relationship Jesus spoke of in John 15 when He said we could do nothing without abiding in the Vine.<br> The church's failure to emphasise our need for intimacy with the Father is exemplified by the number of evangelism strategies and programs designed to win the lost as compared to those designed to help us understand and experience the love of God in our own lives. True transformation only comes when we experience the deep level of love from our Father in a vulnerability that transfers to others.<br> Jesus said, "You will know my disciples by the love they have for one another." The focus is on knowing versus doing.</p>
<p>
When Jesus died, He destroyed the performance model of obeying the Ten Commandments to be acceptable to God. Up until Jesus, people were very much defined by their performance measured against the law.<br> He changed the rules and said, "Accepting Me alone is what makes you acceptable."</p>
<h3>
God as Our Father
</h3>
<p>
<font color= "blue">"When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take care of me" (Psa 27:10)</font>.</p>
<p> 
<font color= "blue">You are the helper of the fatherless" (Psa 10:14)</font>.</p>
<p>
To truly believe we are loved by God and can experience that love, we must overcome a number of personal hurdles. Many of us must overcome the dysfunctional family systems we were brought up in. <br>Our earthly fathers may have taught us that a Heavenly Father could be a dictator, a rejecter of his own offspring, a sexual abuser, a boot camp sergeant, or a traffic cop. These attributes have been the only characteristics of earthly fathers that many people have known. <br>So, to relate to a Heavenly Father as unconditionally loving requires a miracle of sorts. There must be a time of healing from such wounds in order to experience God at a deeply personal love level. This often requires an intentional process of counselling or personal ministry. We must replace what we experienced with what we know the truth to be-that we are loveable and that our Heavenly Father loves us.</p>
