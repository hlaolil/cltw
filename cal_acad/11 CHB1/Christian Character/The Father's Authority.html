   <h1>
The Father's Authority
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
Furthermore, we have had human fathers who corrected us, and we paid them respect. Shall we not much more readily be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live? For they indeed for a few days chastened us as seemed best to them, but He for our profit, that we may be partakers of His holiness. If the imperfect discipline of our earthly fathers was beneficial, how much more beneficial is our Heavenly Father’s perfect discipline. (Heb 12:9-10)</font></p>
<h3>
Human fathers discipline is for children
</h3>
<p>
Hebrews 12:9 contrasts “human fathers” with “the Father of [our] spirits” <br>(our heavenly Father). The expression, "human fathers", focuses on their imperfection.<br> Every earthly father falls short in his knowledge of his children and in wisdom as to how to train and discipline them.<br> But our heavenly Father knows each of us thoroughly and perfectly, including all of our thoughts and motives. He deals with us in perfect wisdom.</p>
<p>
While good human fathers always try to act in love, they often fail.<br>God always acts in love, seeking our highest good.<br> Earthly fathers can be mean or angry, but God is never temperamental.<br> Earthly fathers have jurisdiction over us during childhood.<br> God’s authority and discipline extends over our lifetimes. <br>Good earthly fathers seek to prepare us for life on earth.<br>  God is preparing us for eternity.</p>
<p>
The author’s point is that the discipline of our earthly fathers was beneficial, even though it was flawed by human shortcomings. We respected them for it because we can see how we benefited from it. But God’s discipline is absolutely perfect.</p>
<h3>
The Heavenly Father’s Discipline is Life
</h3>
<p>
The important thing with regard to God’s discipline is the spirit in which we respond. If we resist and harden our hearts, we will miss the purpose of the discipline. If we are truly God’s children, this will result in more discipline. God’s intention is that we respectfully submit to it (Heb 12:9).<br> It’s possible to submit like the defiant little boy whose mother told him to sit in a chair until he calmed down. He clenched his teeth and said, “I’m sitting on the outside, but I’m standing on the inside!” That’s not true submission!<br> The psalmist reflected true submission when he proclaimed, <font color= "blue">
“I know, O Lord, that Your judgements are righteous, and that in faithfulness You have afflicted me” (Psa 119:75)</font>.</p>
<p>
We should submit to God because He has the sovereign right to do with us as He pleases. <br>That is the point of the Book of Job. Even though Job was the most godly man on earth, God had a perfect right to take away everything Job treasured.<br> No man has a claim against Almighty God. One of the most stunning instances of this was when God told the prophet Ezekiel that He was about to take the desire of his eyes (his wife) with a blow. But, God told the prophet not to mourn or weep, as a spiritual object lesson to Israel. So, the next day Ezekiel’s wife died and he did as God had commanded (Ezek. 24:15-24). Wow!</p>
<p>
The prophet had learned a basic lesson that we all need to learn: God is God and I am not God. If the Sovereign of the universe wants to take my wife, my children, my possessions, my health, or my life, that is His prerogative.<br> Faith eventually arrives at saying, “The trial was not as severe as it could have been. It was not as severe as I deserve. And, my Saviour suffered far worse for me.” And so faith submits to the Father’s discipline, trusting that He administers it perfectly for His eternal purpose and for my eternal good.</p>
