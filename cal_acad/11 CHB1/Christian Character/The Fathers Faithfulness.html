The Fathers Faithfulness
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
If we are faithless, He remains faithful; He cannot deny Himself. (2 Tim 2:13)</font></p>
<p>
I don’t think we can ever talk enough about the faithfulness of God. <br>It’s the starting place of any big prayer or act of faith.<br>
Our faith may fail. But God’s faithfulness never will.<br> Our faith is not built on the fault line of feelings or the flood plain of our performance. We build our faith on solid ground. Higher ground.<br> We build on the faithfulness of God.
But I also believe that there’s another side to the interplay between our faith and God’s faithfulness that we can’t afford to ignore. God is faithful even if we are faithless. But God shows His faithfulness in a special way towards those who show their faith in Him.</p>
<p>
It’s simple, really. God is always faithful. But it’s the people who step out in faith that have the opportunity to see God come through for them and move in ways that those who are faithless don’t.
While the Bible is clear that God’s faithfulness is the solid ground of our faith, it’s also clear that our faith gives God a way to display His faithfulness.</p>
<p>
God would have remained faithful if Moses had remained in the desert, herding sheep. But because Moses had the faith to be God’s representative before Pharaoh, he had a front row seat to the 10 plagues and the parting of the Red Sea – both huge demonstrations of God’s faithfulness.</p>
<p>
God would have remained faithful if Daniel hadn’t had the courage to keep praying to God when he was told not to. But because Daniel had the faith to persist, he had a bird’s eye view to God’s faithfulness in the lions den.</p>
<p>
God would have remained faithful if Peter hadn’t walked on water. But because Peter had the faith to step out of the boat, he got to see Jesus’ faithfulness in a way the other disciples didn’t.</p>
<p>
Maybe we could sum it up like this:
God has demonstrated His past faithfulness to give us a foundation for our faith.
Now show God your faith. And He’ll show you His faithfulness.
Not because you would have earned it. But because you would have put yourself in a position to see it.</p>
<p>
Pray big.<br>
Dream big.<br>
Take big steps of faith.</p>
<p>
Because of how you’ve seen God’s faithfulness in the past, and because you want to see Him show His faithfulness in ways you haven’t seen yet in the future.</p>
