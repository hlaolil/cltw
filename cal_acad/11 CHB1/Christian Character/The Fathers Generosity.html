   <h1>
The Fathers Generosity
</h1>
<p>
A life of generosity reflects God’s nature in a special way. Are you eager to give to meet the needs of others? <br>The following characteristics of giving may provide a helpful guide as we <br><font color= "blue">“remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He said, "It is more blessed to give than to receive” (Acts 20:35).</font></p>
<h3>
The Motivation of Genuine Love
</h3>
<p>
It is possible to give without loving, as we find in 1 Cor 13: <font color= "blue">“Though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor ... and have not love, it profits me nothing” <br>(1 Cor 13:3)</font>.<br> On the other hand, God’s example demonstrates that the presence of genuine love motivates giving: <font color= "blue">“For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life” (John 3:16)</font>.</p>
<p>
When you genuinely love someone, you will give to meet his or her needs—without the motive of personal reward. You will give without expecting, or needing, to receive in return. The love in your heart is even more important than the gift in your hands; it gives meaning to your actions and strengthens your relationships.</p>
<p>
This type of giving reflects God’s generosity, and through it He continues to accomplish His redemptive work.<font color= "blue"> “But whoever has this world’s goods, and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his heart from him, how does the love of God abide in him? My little children, let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth.” (1 John 3:17–18)</font>.</p>
<h3>
The Aim of Bringing Pleasure to God
</h3>
<p>
God is pleased with our giving because it reflects His own generous heart, it generates thanksgiving to Him, and it is a vital part of fellowship and communion within the Body of Christ.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“But this I say: He who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. So let each one give as he purposes in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver”<br> (2 Cor 9:6–7)</font>.  A “cheerful” giver is one who eagerly gives God the first fruits of his increase and takes advantage of opportunities to meet the needs of others.</p>
<p>
The cycle of generosity continues because <font color= "blue">“God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may have an abundance for every good work. As it is written: “He has dispersed abroad, He has given to the poor; His righteousness endures forever.” Now may He who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for food, supply and multiply the seed you have sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness, while you are enriched in everything for all liberality, which causes thanksgiving through us to God. For the administration of this service not only supplies the needs of the saints, but also is abounding through many thanksgivings to God,” (2 Cor 9:8–12)</font>.</p>
<h3>
To Strengthen Unity in the Body of Christ
</h3>
<p>
The human body illustrates the unity and interdependence that God designed to characterise the Church. As members of the Body of Christ, we need one another. When we have much, we should give generously and graciously, and when we have needs, we should receive with humility and gratitude.</p>
<p>
Jesus’ love toward us is an example that should inspire our interaction with one another. <font color= "blue">“Therefore be imitators of God as dear children. And walk in love, as Christ also has loved us and given Himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet-smelling aroma.” (Eph 5:1–2)</font>.<br> <font color= "blue">“By this we know love, because He laid down His life for us. And we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren” (1 John 3:16)</font>.</p>
<p>
In the early Church, the needs of the Jewish Christians in Jerusalem inspired the generosity of the Gentile believers whom the Apostle Paul had met on his missionary journeys. This situation forged a precious bond among the believers.<br> Paul wrote to the Corinthian church,<font color= "blue"> “... now at this time your abundance may supply their lack, that their abundance also may supply your lack—that there may be equality” (2 Cor 8:14)</font>.</p>
<p>
A gift—even a cup of cold water—given to followers of Jesus will receive an eternal reward. <font color= "blue">“For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in My name, because you belong to Christ, assuredly, I say to you, he will by no means lose his reward” (Mark 9:41)</font>.</p>
<h3>
Giving With a Generous Heart
</h3>
<p>
In reference to giving, the Scriptures mention having a “bountiful eye” or an “evil eye.” A bountiful eye represents a generous outlook that is alert to the needs of others. <font color= "blue">“He who has a generous eye will be blessed, for he gives of his bread to the poor.” (Prov 22:9)</font>.<br> On the other hand, an evil eye is a stingy, greedy outlook that avoids seeing the needs of others. <font color= "blue">“A man with an evil eye hastens after riches, and does not consider that poverty will come upon him” (Prov 28:22)</font>.<br>
As you give, set your focus on God the Father and His example of generosity: <font color= "blue">“Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no variation or shadow of turning” (James 1:17)</font>.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Bless the Lord, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless His holy name. Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all His benefits: Who forgives all your iniquities: Who heals all your diseases: Who redeems your life from destruction; Who crowns you with loving kindness and tender mercies; Who satisfies your mouth with good things; so that your youth is renewed like the eagle’s” (Psa 103:1–5)</font>.</p>
