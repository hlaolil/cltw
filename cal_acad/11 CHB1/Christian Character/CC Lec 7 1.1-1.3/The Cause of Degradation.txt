The Cause of Degradation

Then the Lord God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of Us, to know good and evil. And now, lest he put out his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever”— therefore the Lord God sent him out of the garden of Eden to till the ground from which he was taken. (Gen 3:22-23)</font>

There is really no such thing as the “innocent” suffering.
Since <font color= "blue">“all have sinned and come short of the glory of God” (Rom 3:23)</font>, there is no one who has the right to freedom from God’s wrath on the basis of his own innocence.
As far as babies are concerned, and others who may be incompetent mentally to distinguish right and wrong, it is clear from both Scripture and universal experience that they are sinners by nature and thus will inevitably become sinners by choice as soon as they are able to do so.
The world is now under God’s Curse because of man’s rebellion against God’s Word. (Gen 3)</p>
<p>
This <font color= "blue">“bondage of corruption,”</font> with which the <font color= "blue">“the whole creation groans and labours with birth pangs together until now.” (Rom 8:21-22)</font>, is universal, affecting all men and women and children everywhere. God did not create the world this way, and one day will set all things right again. In that day, <font color= "blue">“God will wipe every tear from their eyes; there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying. There shall be no more pain for the former things have passed away” (Rev 21:4)</font>.</p>
<h3>
Jesus Christ suffered
</h3>
<p>
The Lord Jesus Christ, who was the only truly “innocent” and “righteous” man in all history, nevertheless has suffered more than anyone else who ever lived.

And this He did for us! <font color= "blue">“Christ died for our sins” (1 Cor 15:3)</font>. He suffered and died, in order that ultimately He might deliver the world from the Curse, and that, even now, He can deliver from sin and its bondage anyone who will receive Him in faith as personal Lord and Saviour. This great deliverance from the penalty of inherent sin, as well as of overt sins, very possibly also assures the salvation of those who have died before reaching an age of conscious choice of wrong over right.
With our full faith in God’s goodness and in Christ’s redemption, we can recognise that our present sufferings can be turned to His glory and our good.</p>
<h3>
Sufferings of the Unsaved
</h3>
<p>
The sufferings of unsaved men are often used by the Holy Spirit to cause them to realise their needs of salvation and to turn to Christ in repentance and faith. The sufferings of Christians should always be the means of developing a stronger dependence on God and a more Christ-like character, if they are properly “exercised thereby” (Heb 12:11).
Thus, God is loving and merciful, even when, “for the present,” He allows trials and sufferings to come in our lives.</p>
