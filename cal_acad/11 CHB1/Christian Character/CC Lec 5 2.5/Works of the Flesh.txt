<h1>
Works of the Flesh
</h1>
<p> <font color= "blue">
I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Now the works of the flesh are evident, which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. (Gal 5:16-21)</font>.</p>
<h3>
Sins of the Flesh
</h3>
<p>
The sins here mentioned seem to fall into four groups:</p> 
<p>(1) Sensuality fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness; </p>
<p>(2) Unlawful things in the spiritual realm - Idolatry, 
sorcery; </p>
<p>(3) Forms of discord - enmities, strife, jealousies, wrath, factions, divisions, parties, envying;</p> 
<p>(4) intemperate excesses - drunkenness, revellings; and such like things.</p>
<h3>
They will not inherit the Kingdom of God
</h3>
<p>
We rejoice to see so many righteous souls that are warring effectively against the flesh and are producing the fruit of the Spirit. However, it is saddening when we see those who profess to be children of God losing the battle against the flesh. With the rise of emphasis on sensuality, premarital and extramarital sexual relation are claiming some. Uncleanness and lascivious doings are the cause of others departing from the faith. Today, surprising as it is, we are being exposed to liberal doses of idolatry and sorcery. Oriental cults and Satan worship are becoming more common, especially among high school and college groups. Even more insidious are the things that cause discord: enmity, strife, jealousy, wrath, factions, divisions, parties, envying. Somehow these sins, since they have to do with attitudes and resultant consequences, are bad but not too bad and are relegated to naughty misdemeanours. As a result many excuse themselves and others even attempt to justify the practice. Those who are loosing this war and those who see it as inconsequential along with those who are just drifting along sort of lackadaisical need to wise up, wake up, repent of their sins, live and act so as to honour Him who died for us. Remember those who lose this war shall not inherit the kingdom of heaven.</p>

"Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts. And do not present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as being alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God."
