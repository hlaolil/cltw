   <h1>
Characteristics of Childhood
</h1>
<h3>
Fitful and Unreliable
</h3>
<p>
The child tends to be an optimist as well as a pragmatist. <br>

Children have a tendency to deny unpleasant realities and to 

have a cheerful outlook on life. The world is a new and 

exciting place full of things to experience and learn about. 

Because the child lives in the here and now, every activity is 

important, and the most important activity is the one in which 

he is presently engaged. <br>That is why it is often so difficult 

for children to concentrate on more than one thing at a 

time. <br>These various 

aspects of the child are, however, not yet coordinated into a 

general scheme of self as a functioning totality</p>
<h3>
Impulsive
</h3>
<p>
Children also look forward to growing up, and they try and run 

before they can walk as evidence of their growing maturity and 

independence.<br>
Fortunately, for most children, their optimism is undaunted. 

They are excited about what they would like to become and are 

not bothered by the real and many hurdles that lie in the path 

of the desired goal and often look before they leap. In other words they can be impulsive. <br>At its base, children's optimism rests in 

their belief that they have an almost unlimited number of years 

to attain their goals. The union of pragmatism and optimism in 

the child is not really surprising because the two usually go 

together. Those concerned with getting things done are often 

imbued with unlimited faith in what can be accomplished by 

persistent effort, and that is the true spirit of 

childhood.</p>
<h3>
Curious
</h3>
<p>
By engaging in all sorts of activities, children are 

discovering themselves. <br>It is a psychological truism that we 

are what we do. The child must discover what sort of pupil, 

athlete, musician, peer, and friend he really is, and these 

discoveries can be made only through his classroom work, his 

participation in sports, his efforts to play an instrument, and 

his interactions and friendships with peers. <br>
By engaging in these many activities, the child evokes 

reactions in others that give him the information he needs to 

find out about himself.<br>
Childhood, then, is a period of self-discovery in which the 

child learns about himself in the course of engaging in a 

variety of academic, extracurricular, and recreational 

activities and in relating to other people.</p> 
<h3>
Evil speaking
</h3>
<p>
The child is more or less unaware of the many discontinuities 

in his behaviour and in his self-evaluations. For example, he 

may be a perfect gentleman at his friend's house but a demon at 

home, or vice versa, without being aware of the contradictions 

in his behaviour. <br>The adolescent may show similar 

contradictions, but he is aware of these discrepancies and 

tries to rationalise them, at least to himself.</p>
<h3>
Other Heroes
</h3>
<p>
In addition to finding out about himself, the child is also 

discovering the larger social world about him, the world of 

entertainers, politicians, scientists, and athletes. <br>Often 

children choose individuals from these professions as persons 

to idealise and emulate, particularly as they discover that 

their parents are not as all-knowing and as wise as they had 

thought. <br>By the age of seven or eight, the child has dethroned 

his parents from the once-exalted position they held for the 

child during the preschool years.<br> Now, new gods are introduced 

into the pantheon of childhood. However, it is often the 

glamour of the entertainer or athlete, rather than his or her 

character or accomplishments, that attracts the child.</p>
<p>
This does not mean that the child no longer loves his parents 

or that he denies the authority of the family. His family is 

still the centre of his life. <br>It is just that other forms of 

authority and other adult figures now begin to have an 

influence upon him, namely the peer group and his new 

non parental adult idols.
<h3>
Foolish speaking
</h3>
<p> 
The child's attitude toward authority is not entirely 

subservient, for he does express negative feelings toward adult 

constraint. He does so, however, in a manner peculiar to 

childhood—a manner that is often missed by adults, sharing by 

the group so that no child takes individual responsibility for 

them. In this way, the child can participate in hostile 

bantering about the adult world without fear of reprisal.
<h3>
Vain speaking
</h3>
<p>
The elementary school years are devoted to discovering the self 

through repeated encounters with others and to discovering the 

world through incessant activity. Although the child is 

generally subservient to authority, he nonetheless expresses 

his underlying defiance in concert with the peer group. In this 

way he avoids taking individual responsibility for being 

disrespectful to those who maintain the balance of power.
