<h1>
Dependence on mature Christians
</h1>
<p>
Jesus compared becoming a Christian with being reborn. Speaking with Nicodemus, He said,<font color= "blue">“Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.” (John 3:3)</font>. He went on to call it being <font color= "blue">“born of the Spirit” (John 3:8)</font>.</p>
<p>
Being reborn means to become an infant again—in this case a spiritual infant. But infants are supposed to grow, so we must grow spiritually if we want to become what God intends.
Thus, those who do not mature spiritually fail to thrive as Christians. We are familiar with the “failure to thrive” syndrome in children. The causes vary, but the long-term result is usually a lack of proper development. Similarly, immature Christians don’t develop as they should and miss out on true life in Christ.
<h3>
Infants in Christ.
</h3>
<p>
Paul addressed this situation with the church in Corinth. Their fundamental problem was that they were still spiritually immature. He told them, <font color= "blue">“And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual people but as to carnal, as to babes in Christ.” (1 Cor 3:1)</font>.</p>
<p>
Their failure to mature as disciples meant that the church was largely ineffective in God’s kingdom work.
As usual, Paul didn’t mince words. His message was clear: Grow up, you big babies!</p>

He used a similar word picture when explaining the purpose for church leaders:
<font color= "blue">And He Himself gave some to be apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some pastors and teachers, 12 for the equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ; that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting, (Eph 4:11-14)</font></p>
<p>
A Christian who remains a spiritual infant will be subject to abuse by worldly people who take advantage of them. That’s obviously not a good situation.</p>
<p>
There were other examples of spiritual infants in the early church. Ananias and Sapphira hungered for material possessions and the praise of men, and they paid for it with their lives (see Acts 5:1-10). Simon in Samaria wanted to buy spiritual maturity, and that didn’t work (see Acts 8:9-24).
</p>
<p>
The lesson for us is that we must grow into spiritual maturity to avoid problems and please our Saviour. It is neither acceptable to God nor beneficial for the Christian to remain a spiritual infant.</p>

 

The Solution.

Since the Christian life is fundamentally a relationship with God, the basic problem of immature believers is that they do not develop that relationship.

And one of the keys to success in any relationship is communication. Mature believers have developed strong lines of communication with Christ. Without that communication, the believer can’t grow.

The solution is to grow in intimacy with Christ. That comes through devoting time and effort to prayer, studying the Bible, and meditating on God’s words. By seeking time with God and listening to His guidance, you will mature in your spiritual life.

Don’t fail to thrive. Become intimate with Jesus.
