The Abundance of the Heart

<h3>
How Abundant is Your Heart?
</h3>
<p>
In (James 3), we are admonished to beware of the tongue, which is what Prov 18:21, is saying as well when it tells us that death, and life are in the power of the tongue. It is also diagnosing conditions to beware of. In this account in the Epistle of James, he warns, exhorts, counsels and admonishes, that in many things, we can offend with our words, and he goes on to explain that, if any man is capable of not offending with his words, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body.</p>
<p>
This is practical and possible, when we exercise care in choosing what we say, and how we say it. The thought of what to say should precede what we speak. Most orators, or speakers generally take time to rehearse their words, they write down pivotal points, or they just give it thought before they speak it. They have a working idea of what they are going to communicate. Let there be light and revelation through this message, and correction, if it is not yet in operation.</p>
<p>
This is not a joking matter. Either you mean to pronounce good things upon all those you mean to bless, imparting only good words over them, for, towards and into the lives you purpose and intend to bless, and really mean it with a pure heart, or you may just have ill-will, if you speak negative after you have spoken good. It is like making a good declaration over someone, and as soon as they don’t measure up, you speak negative about them. You change a blessing into a curse, that eradicates and dissolves the blessing you spoke concerning them.</p>
<p>
This is a defining moment, in remembering just what my mother words scream out to me, if you don’t have anything good, nice or kind to say, hold your piece, and keep the peace for speaking good with. Don’t be a blessing giver that gives blessings then takes them back, in other words, don’t give good words, then take them back with negative words. Good words are on the assignment that you have sent them forth to accomplish, negative words will only cancel and rescind the good, if you speak them.</p>
<p>
The life that good produces, or could produce is forfeited when the negative words are spoken. Speaking good is a transaction. We all must balance our cheque books, to ensure that we have adequate credits which offset our debits, so that we are not overdrawn. Look at good as a credit that always increases the balance in your account, and a debit as the negative that always reduces and decreases the balance. We need those adequate credit transactions or we will operate in an overdraft status. Continuity of good has to be real and actual.</p>
<p>
Let your words be parallel with the good you want to commission, or don’t speak any good you can’t endorse for the long haul. Beware of small talk, gossiping and back-biting. These things will overdraw your account, because you won't have the good in your heart, which is one of your accounts, to cover your transactions. Watch what you speak against other spirit filled believers, respect the Holy Ghost operating through them, even if it is at a minimum and not maximum capacity. Learn to respect the Holy Ghost and what and how He does it through others. Watch out for the malignity of speaking evil that it doesn't promote blasphemy.</p>
<p>
“Therefore I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven men. Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come. “Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or else make the tree bad and its fruit bad; for a tree is known by its fruit. Brood of vipers! How can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. A good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things. But I say to you that for every idle word men may speak, they will give account of it in the day of judgement. For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.” (Matt 12:31-37).</p>
<p>
In this account in Matthew 12, all the people were amazed at Jesus' healing of the man that was possessed with a devil, blind and dumb, and their focus was on the good He had done. Everyone except of course the Pharisees, and they accused Him of casting out the devils but by Beelzebub the prince or ruler of the devils. Jesus knew their thoughts and said unto them;" every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand". Here lies the incentive we need not to speak against each other, in doing so we are causing division.</p>
<p>
Jesus said, from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks, the abundant life is that He came to give us, and good things should spring forth from our mouths, declaring the greatness of God in every way. We can do what God says we can, and we are a divine creation of God every part of us. We can speak good things in abundance. How can an abundant heart speak evil or negative? We should endeavour to say what we mean and mean what we say. If I speak well of anyone, I should mean what I say and allow the good to materialize concerning them. We have a good treasury within us.</p>
<p>
Good is on a long journey and has been spoken into manifestation by God. Whatever can prohibit the good we speak from materialising shouldn’t ever be our words once we have assigned them to accomplish that good from an abundant heart. What if God cancelled all good towards us? Where would we be? Yes, an abundant heart is one full of goodness and kindness. Speak kindly of others or hold your piece, until you can think it through effectively and positively.</p>
<p>
Pay close attention to what you are thinking about because, the words to support those thoughts will follow, be it life or death. It is likened to programming a computer with the wrong software and all the files are all messed up inside, and filled with junk. Program your life with the seeds of positive word producing thoughts within to change all thinking patterns. This is the beginning of restoration of our health holistically and on every level.</p>
<p>
God’s plans for us are good not evil, we must develop a vocabulary that speaks just that, and don’t believe lies. We should get up each morning expecting a change; God is looking for our faith to add His goodness and kindness to it. We are always one step closer today to our miracle. When we quit expecting the worst and start expecting the best we will prosper and make it part of our declarations. We must get a bigger vision for our lives and get rid of negative mindsets designed to keep us down and put others down. We must avoid the grasshopper mentality.</p>
<p>
Twelve spies were sent to spy out the land, all had a negative report, except for Joshua and Caleb, they had a different spirit, they spoke blessings. God is bigger than negative limited thinking, which can and will stop us from obtaining fortitude and going into the promised life of abundance that Jesus came to give us. The grasshopper mentality focuses on too many giants in the land and all the reasons why it can’t be done and is a negative report. Whose report will you believe? We shall believe the report of the Lord! In this examination regarding this subject we have many sound biblical counsellors; we have King Solomon, the Lord Jesus Christ, the Apostles James and Paul who are still speaking today loud and clear and I choose to believe their reports. In the multitude of counsellors there is safety. My mother was right and her judgement sound and her words assisted me to come into alignment and shift the climates words produce.</p>
<p>
Beloved, choose good words and choose life and give your tongue power to change things!</p>
