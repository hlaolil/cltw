   <h1>
Immature Christians 
</h1>
<p>
It seems many people professing to be Christian do not have a proper grounding in the scriptures. They drink the milk but do not seem to be able<br> (or maybe have no desire?) to eat the real meat- understand the deeper things of God, in spite of the fact that scriptures tells us the Holy Spirit will teach us all things.</p>
<p>
Immature "Christians" believe that Scripture must conform to their opinions, assumptions and feelings instead of conforming to what it says.<br> The hirelings upon the pulpit tickle the immature pew warmers ears with sophistry (the use of reasoning or arguments that sound correct but are actually false) that appeals to their desires.</p>
<p>
Knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone’s own interpretation. For <font color= "blue">prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. (2 Peter 1:21-22)</font></p>
<p>
It is impossible for a true Christian to remain immature because true growth comes from the power of grace working in a person's life.<br> To remain immature is a negation of the power of the Holy Spirit.<br>
An immature "Christian" will choke on meat because the Holy Spirit is the factor of knowing how to consume and digest it in the right way. <br>If you take a bottle away from an infant and put a steak on a plate in front of him with a knife and fork, it would put the infant in a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>
So many who are caught up in the institutionalised "church" system are suckling on milk bottles not realising that the Holy Spirit is missing in their lives.<br>
A true Christian can initially be immature, but in a state of growth.<br> We know them by their fruit, which means that there must be maturity in their growth cycle.<br> An immature "Christian" judges by how something looks, but the primary purpose of a maturing Christian is to bear fruit; therefore, judged by what it produces.</p>
<p>
The deception is that it is possible for grapes to be stuck on thorn bushes and for figs to be stuck on thistles. From afar they appear to be real growing fruit trees to the naive and immature.</p>
