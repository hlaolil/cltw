   <h1>
Developing Christian Character
</h1>
<p>
Growing in Christian Character is very important in our walk with God.<br> Peter said <font color= "blue">
"But also for this very reason, giving all diligence, add to your faith virtue, to virtue knowledge, to knowledge self-control, to self-control perseverance, to perseverance godliness, to godliness brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness love. For if these things are yours and abound, you will be neither barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ." <br>(2 Peter 1:5-8)</font></p>
<h3>
A Baby Diet
</h3>
<p>
From the time a baby is born, the parents are concerned with the child’s growth and maturity. At first a baby can only drink milk, than gradually solid foods are added until eventually that child can eat meat.<br> If an infant is kept on milk past the time that solid foods should have been added to their diet, the child will become anaemic and sickly and a condition which doctors label as failure to thrive can develop.<br>It is the same with the Christian life.</p>
<p>
A baby who does not have interaction with its Mom during the first 24 months of life fails to come to healthy maturity.<br> A healthy relationship with the Lord builds a strong bond enabling that Christian to mature into a fruitful, productive and happy adult. <br>This relationship is developed by cultivating an environment conducive to growth, which includes spending time daily with the Lord through quiet time, prayer, reading and studying His Word and worship.</p>
<p>
A new born Christian will be content with milk for a time but they will begin to thrive only as they progress to solid food and then on to meat.<br> The problem is that many Christians fail to thrive because they are still only drinking milk after years in the faith. <br>The apostle Paul addressed the issue of growing in Christian character when he spoke to the Christians in Corinth as “babes in Christ” (1 Cor 3:1-3).<br> Also in Heb 5:12-14, do the scriptures confront spiritual immaturity.</p>
<h3>
A more Mature Diet
</h3>
<p>
According to Peter in order to escape the corruption of the world, we need to diligently seek Christ in order to add some character traits to our faith so that we may partake of His divine nature.<br> In other words, we can grow up to be spiritually mature and “look like Jesus” by building on a firm foundation of faith.</p>
<p>
Moses and Joshua set an example for us to follow in that they loved the presences of God. (Ex 33:7-11) <br>Jesus commanded us saying <font color= "blue">“learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.” (Matt 11:29)</font> <br>The Lord invites us to an abundant life when He says, <font color= "blue">“Listen carefully to Me, and eat what is good and let you soul delight itself in abundance. Incline your ear, and come to Me. Hear, and your soul shall live.” (Isa 55:2-3)</font><br>
A meditation on the excellence of the Word of God is found in Psa 119;<br> <font color= "blue">“Your word I have hidden in my heart, that I might not sin against you.” <br>(Psa 119:11)</font></p>
<h3>
The Holy Spirit Teaches
</h3>
<p>
As the Holy Spirit our teacher opens our eyes, the scripture begins to take root in our heart.<br> In Isa 28 we read, <font color= "blue">“Whom will he teach knowledge? And whom will he make to understand the message? Those just weaned from milk? Those just drawn from the breast? For precept must be upon precept,line upon line, line upon line. Here a little, there a little.” (Isa 28:9-10)</font></p>
<p>
If we earnestly seek God, we will find Him. If we desire to know Him, He will send the Holy Spirit to teach us. <font color= "blue">“Then you will call upon Me and go and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart. (Jer 29:12-13)</font></p>
<p>
I encourage you to pray and ask God to bring friends into your path that are also desiring to grow in Christian character. May your life abound in the fruit of His Spirit and your very lives exhibit the character of Christ.</p>
