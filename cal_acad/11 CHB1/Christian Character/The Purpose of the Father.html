   <h1>
The Purpose of the Father
</h1>
<p>
<font color= "blue">“The Spirit of the Lord God is upon Me, because the Lord has anointed Me to preach good tidings to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to those who are bound; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn," (Isa 61:1-2)</font></p>
 <p>
Familiar words I’m sure you will agree. Familiar to us, I hope, but if you were reading them in Old Testament times you may wonder who the "Me" in this passage is. Whoever "Me" is, the Spirit of the Lord God is upon Him (or her). Alright, it’s a "Him". What’s more, Yahweh has anointed Him. <br>And what a life He would lead – the afflicted would hear news that would be like music to their ears! The broken-hearted would have their wounds bound and healed. And the captives, in all walks of life, and in all manner of prisons, would be set free. Needless to say, prizes are not on offer for knowing who the "Me" is in this passage. There is only one person in all of human history who qualifies.</p>
<h3> 
Reasons to rejoice
</h3>
<p>
In this study I wanted to focus on the reasons to rejoice as a Christian. <br>It does us good to just take a little time out to remember these things! <br>So Isaiah 61 – it sounds familiar, or should sound familiar, because this is a Messianic prophecy that is quoted directly by Jesus in the New Testament. Let’s have a look:</p>
 
<p><font color= "blue">
Then Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and news of Him went out through all the surrounding region. And He taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all. So He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. And as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read. And He was handed the book of the prophet Isaiah. And when He had opened the book, He found the place where it was written: “The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.”
Then He closed the book, and gave it back to the attendant and sat down. And the eyes of all who were in the synagogue were fixed on Him. And He began to say to them, “Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing.” So all bore witness to Him, and marvelled at the gracious words which proceeded out of His mouth. And they said, “Is this not Joseph’s son? (Luke 4:14-20) </font></p>
<p>
Now things were definitely out of the ordinary! The members of the synagogue thought they were going along to a normal Saturday meeting... but they got oh so much more than that! Jesus said "today this scripture has been fulfilled". <br>It was a prophecy given by Isaiah that had sat unfulfilled for the previous 700 years. But that morning it was fulfilled.<br> Jesus was saying "I am the one it speaks of. I am the one who has been anointed to heal the broken-hearted and set the captives free".<br> He wasn’t just quoting Isaiah. He was quoting what Isaiah had heard from Him, and about Him, 700 years ago! <br>The people couldn’t believe what they were hearing! Yet they were puzzled – Isn’t this Joseph’s son? Isn’t this the carpenter? “Jeziel, didn’t Jesus do that extension on your home and build that fence?” “Zachias, didn’t Jesus build that cart for you?” “He can’t be the Messiah could He?” “And yet, no one has spoken like this before. How gracious are His words!”</p>
 <p>
The truth is that there has been and will be, no one like Jesus Christ. From His birth to His life, to His death, to His resurrection ... there is no one like Jesus. 
<h3>
The God of grace
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed; to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.” <br>(Isa 61:1-2)</p></font>  
<p>
Before Jesus came, people had been wondering what God is really like ... There had been 400 years of silence in terms of no recognised prophet declaring the will of God. You can imagine what the people thought.<br> Does He hate us? Is He sick of us? Will He come to judge? Does He care about what we go through down here on earth? And then God became a man. And He came. And we could see what He was like. He came for the poor ... the afflicted ... the broken-hearted ... the captive, the sinners. He came to set them free. <br>God became a man ... we could see what He was like ... and He was, quite frankly, far better and amazing than we had thought! We have joy and thanksgiving due to the character of the one we serve. Sometimes you see yourself and you see your sin and you see that you have failed God and think that God must be getting to the end of His rope with me! And yet you find yourself blessed ... and all you can think and say is "Who is this God?"
<h3>
The God of Comfort
 </h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God; to comfort all who mourn," (Isa 61:2)</font></p>
 <p>
When Jesus quoted this passage in the synagogue, He stopped mid sentence! He stopped after saying it was the "favourable year of the Lord" and didn’t mention the day of vengeance. Yes, there is a day of vengeance.<br> The signs of the Lord’s return seem to be with us in this day. But the day of vengeance has not come yet. Note that it mentions "a year of the Lord’s favour" and only "a day of vengeance". We are still in that period known as the year of the Lord’s favour. But I want to make mention of the last part of the verse which is a reason to rejoice. He comforts those who mourn!<br> We think of comfort as an old man patting a young boy on the head saying there, there, there ... you’ll be OK. But it is far more than that.<br> God comes along side. He is with us. His presence and companionship strengthens us.</p> 
<p>
I hope, and am sure, that you can think of times in your life when you have experienced this.</p>
