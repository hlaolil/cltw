Spiritual Authority
</h1>
<p> <font color= "blue">
Obey those who rule over you, and be submissive, for they watch out for your souls, as those who must give account. Let them do so with joy and not with grief, for that would be unprofitable for you. (Heb 13:17)</font> <br>(see also Gal 6:1, 1Thess 5:11-14)</p>
<p>
It is understood that the spiritual authority spoken of in Heb 13:17 is legitimate.<br> Yet, for us today, this doesn't automatically mean that it applies to everyone who claims to speak for God. The spiritual authority of Heb 13:17 taught the truth of God's Word and they practised authority the way Jesus instructed them.<br> They provided leadership by example. They were mindful of their responsibility to give an account one day to the Lord of the way they cared for His people. <br>If they gave an account that caused them grief (because you failed to obey God's Word) then it was unprofitable for you. <br>Yet, if they gave an account that caused them joy (because you obeyed God's Word) then it is profitable for you.<br> The author's motivation in Hebrews 13:17 is not an attempt to establish some sort of "mandated obedience", but to set up a situation for your personal profit.</p>
<p>
Most importantly, Kenneth S. Wuest reveals that the writer is addressing a problem that existed among Hebrew believers, where many had received "strange doctrines" taught by other teachers that caused them to be "mutinous" or rebellious against the truth of Scripture and those who taught it. Wuest suggested that some of these Hebrew believers were turning away from the faith as a result. </p>
<p>This is a most crucial point of context that most Christians ignore. <br>It is a problem that constantly plagued the leadership of the first century church. Jewish, or Hebrew believers were especially vulnerable to false teaching that brought them back under the bondage of Old Testament Law. <br>In this situation the writer of Hebrews (commonly thought to be the apostle Paul) urges them to "Obey those who have the rule over you" so that they could profit from the liberating knowledge of God's Word. <br>It was an admonishment to reject the strange doctrine others had taught and embrace the instruction of Godly authority that walked in the truth.</p>
<p> When you see the whole picture it's sound advice. It's a statement I would make under the same circumstances. Yet, in the modern church, the kind of spiritual authority practised by the leaders in Hebrews 13:17 is hard to find. Many times, the decision about whether authority is legitimate or illegitimate can be subjective. In this difficult area we need God's Holy Spirit as our teacher. According to Jesus Christ, He (the Holy Spirit) indwells us in order to lead us into all truth ... and that includes the knowledge and recognition of Godly authority.</p>
<p>
You must want to know the truth of Hebrews 13:17 rather than allow a personal bias to influence its interpretation. This topic requires some digging in order to arrive at a balanced understanding.</p>
<h3>
General Guidelines For Spiritual Authority
</h3>
<p>
Below, I list some general characteristics of New Testament spiritual authority. The list is not exhaustive. Yet, it can give the reader a place to start on this challenging and often confusing subject.</p>
<p>
When considering a church home, look for the following traits in leaders:</p>

<p>Teaches that the Bible is God's Word and is to be taken literally.</p>

<p>Holds solidly to the belief that Jesus Christ is God in the flesh, and the only Head of the Church.</p>

<p>Teaches the whole Gospel ... salvation by faith in Jesus Christ alone...and receiving power through the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</p>

<p>Encourages those under their care to fellowship with other believers outside their own group.</p>

<p>Believes and teaches the correct understanding of the New Testament Church ... that it's not a building or an organization, but all those having faith in Christ for salvation.</p>

<p>Sees themselves as "brethren" in the Body of Christ, just like those under their care (leaders are also God's sheep). Does not "flaunt" seminary or educational credentials as authority qualifications. Possesses humility and a "servant's" attitude when viewing their position in Christ's Church. Avoids the clergy/laity error found in religious titles such as Father, Bishop, Reverend, etc.</p>

<p>Authority is gained and recognised by experience in the faith and the quality/example of life lived.</p>

<p>Leaves meeting attendance as an issue between the believer and the Lord.</p>

<p>Does not compel believers to follow the Old Covenant tithing requirements ... yet encourages God's people to participate in the freedom of Godly New Testament giving without intimidation or guilt. <br>Trusts the Lord to meet the financial needs of the fellowship or church.</p>

<p>Openly rejects and exposes popular legalistic teaching and doctrine common in the Church in order to protect new believers ... and embraces God's Grace in a way that generates a sense of liberty and freedom of choice.</p>

<p>Can deal firmly (yet lovingly), when necessary, with people who practice a sinful lifestyle, discouraging the practice of living in continual sin while using God's Grace as an excuse.</p>
