Your body is a Temple
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own? (1 Cor 6:19)</font></p>
<p>
A temple is a sacred site where a deity is supposed to dwell and can be accessed and experienced. <br>Your body is a temple. It is a sacred site. It is holy. It is never to be violated or profaned. The God within the temple is not some god of thunder or wind , a monkey god or a good luck charm. The God within is the Holy Spirit.<br> Therefore in the temple of your body dwells the God who was brooding over the waters at Creation, who is the source of wisdom, who is love on fire with holiness, the God from whom all lesser gods flee in terror, who is mighty, powerful, majestic and righteous. Defile His temple and beware!<br> This Holy Spirit is our possession from God, our treasure.</p> 
<h3>
Spirit-indwelt
</h3>
<p>
Human beings were always meant to be Spirit-indwelt beings, indwelt with the Holy Spirit as images of God. Our bodies were part of this design.<br> We are temples, sacred, wonderful, filled with the power and presence of God. People should be able to come to a Christian just as an idol-worshipper goes to a temple to find the god there. People should be able to come to us and find Christ in residence.They should be able to come to the Christ-indwelt bodies of Christians and sense the holiness and presence of God.<br> People go to temples with needs -and I think they should have their needs met by Christ in us. People should be able to come to Christians for wisdom, a word from God, guidance in life, healing, encouragement etc. and we should be able to minister to them not in our own strength but out of the power of Christ who indwells us.<br>We cannot do this if our bodies are given to immorality.</p>
<p>
You were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.
God bought your body on the cross. <br>He paid a very high price for it - His own beloved Son.</p>
