<h1>
Controlling your Tongue
</h1>
<p>
The apostle James spoke of our struggle with our speech in chapter 3 of his epistle: <font color= "blue">"If anyone does not stumble in word, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle the whole body," (James 3:2)</font>. The King James Version translates the word "stumble" as "offend." Who hasn't regretted something he or she has said, wishing he or she could take it back?</p>
<p>
Is the speech we use harsh, condemning, condescending? Or is it comforting, patient and encouraging? God expects us to remember that our communication with each other should edify rather than cause someone to stumble in living God's way of life. In fact, we are specifically instructed not to make others stumble (Mark 9:42).</p>
<p>
One positive way we can use our speech is to recognise in others the good things we see them do. Catch someone doing the right thing and let them know. A simple compliment can reinforce the behaviour God wants to see in all of us.</p>
<p>
In verses 3 and 4 James talks of the power in our tongue by using the analogies of a ship's rudder and a bridle in a horse's mouth. These are great analogies because rudders and bridles are small devices used to direct much larger objects. In what direction are we letting our tongues take us? Does our speech lead us to build up and improve or to tear down and ruin?<br>
As Christians, we must always remember that our thoughts direct our words, and our words direct our actions. The small things we say, which we may think will not have much impact, can change the course of someone's outlook, mood or even (if said often enough) the course of someone's life—for good or bad.</p>
<p>
James continues in verses 5 and 6 discussing the damage our words can do if we are not careful. He likens that damage to the damage a fire causes. We are cautioned that if we allow our speech to "burn" others, we can be in danger of the judgement fire (eternal death). Searing sarcasm or put-downs are two examples of types of speech that can damage others. Instead, James instructs us that we must apply a wisdom to our words that is not worldly. In fact, taming the tongue is a matter of applying God's wisdom every day (James:3:17).</p>
<h3>
Speaking With Godly Wisdom
</h3>
<p>
How do we apply God's wisdom in our speech? A major part of using God's wisdom in our speech is to not forget God's law and to put His commandments in our heart (Prov 3:1). If our mouths are to speak from the abundance of our hearts, then our hearts must have the right thoughts from which to speak. God's commandments provide this proper foundation. From this perspective, the book of Proverbs has much wisdom to offer in how to live and interact with others.</p>
<p>
Here are some verses in Proverbs that can help us to understand the power of our words:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">A soft answer turns away wrath, but a harsh word stirs up anger.(Prov 15:1)</font>.</p>
<p>A wholesome tongue is a tree of life, but perverseness in it breaks the spirit.(Prov 15:4)</font>.</p>
<p>Excellent speech is not becoming to a fool, much less lying lips to a prince (Prov 17:7)</font>.</p>
<p>He who repeats a matter separates friends. (Prov 17:9)</font>.</p>
<p>The beginning of strife is like releasing water; (Prov 17:14)</font>.</p>
<p>He who has a perverse tongue falls into evil (Prov 17:20)</font>.</p>
<p>The wellspring of wisdom is a flowing brook. (Prov 18:4)</font>.</p>
<p>A fool’s lips enter into contention, and his mouth calls for blows (Prov 18:6)</font>.</p>
<p>
Taming our tongue is possible with God's help, but it takes effort and discipline. Let's fulfil James:3:2 and strive not to stumble in word. Instead, let's move forward to become perfect Christians, able to bridle our tongues</p>
