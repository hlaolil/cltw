<h1>
The Nature of the Father
</h1>
<p>
To be a father, in the biological sense, means to communicate life and existence to another. For human beings, there is more to being a father than just generating a son or a daughter. For a father not only generates — he also cares for his children by providing them with the material and spiritual things they need to grow up decently and enter into human society. In addition, the attentive father has a personal love for his children which elicits love from them in return. Since a father guides and directs his children until they can care for themselves, the notion of "father" includes the idea of authority over another, but normally in the sense of authority exercised in a spirit of love.</p>

If we reflect a moment on who we are with our unlimited limitations, and who God is with His radiant infinity, it seems very bold to call God "Father". We are so weak. He is almighty. We are so sinful. He is holy. But Jesus teaches us in the Gospels to address God as "Father". When the disciples asked Jesus to teach them how to pray He told them to say, "Our Father…." He told Mary Magdalene on that bright Easter morning in the garden to tell the Apostles, <font color= "blue">
"I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God" (John 20:17)</font></p>

For your Sunday Scriptural reading, I suggest that you read attentively the Sermon on the Mount, Matt chapters 5 to 7, and notice how often Jesus says "Father" when speaking of God. There He tells us to be perfect as the heavenly Father is perfect (Matt 5:48).</p>

Because of our experience of fatherhood on the natural level, there is some justification in calling God "Father". The term was rarely used in the early books of the Old Testament, but became more common about two hundred years before Christ. It was Jesus, however, who really taught us to address God as "Father". Because Jesus is the only-begotten Son of God, having the same divine nature as the Father, there is a unique sense in which He calls God His Father. In His divine nature Jesus is the natural Son of the Father. By sending the Holy Spirit into our hearts — when we believe and accept baptism — Jesus gives us a share in His own divine life and so we become adopted sons and daughters of the Father.</p>

Today there is much talk about "human dignity". Our true dignity comes from the fact that God loves each one of us and has destined all of us to be His children. And since we are all sons of God in Christ, that means that we are all brothers. With Christ we can all say Abba — Father.</p>
