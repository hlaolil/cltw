<h1>The Lord Our God Is One Lord</h1>
<p>
Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one! Deuteronomy 6:4</p>
<p>
Jesus answered him, “The first of all the commandments is: ‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one. Mark 12:29 </p>
<p>
You shall have no other gods before Me. Exodus 20:3</p>
<p>
Monotheism is the belief in and worship of one God. Polytheism, on the other hand, acknowledges a plurality of gods. In the beginning humankind worshipped one God, but as the earth filled, knees bowed to other gods.</p>
<p>
"In the history of all the different nations where polytheism is practiced we may trace a period where the idea of one God was more or less prevalent." (Cyclopaedia of Biblical, Theological and Ecclesiastical Literature by John McClintock and James Strong. 1890: Vol. VI, page 511)</p>
<p>
With but one exception the early history of humankind reveals a constant yearning and search for new gods. The disaffection of nations with monotheism, however, was seldom total. The various religions and mythologies of the world usually maintained some superior deity among their host of gods.
The exception, the nation of Israel, was by no means immune to this malady. Its people were continually being infected by their neighbours.</p>
<ul>
<li>"They served their(neighbours) idols, Which became a snare to them." (Psa. 106:36).</li></ul></p>

<h2>The God of Israel</h2>
<p>
Only the valiant efforts of a few faithful ones prevented complete apostasy.
<ul>
<li>"... do not follow other gods to serve them." — Jeremiah 35:15 </li></ul></p>
<p>
These men of Israel clearly and conclusively demonstrated the validity of monotheism—the need, the necessity, to worship one God. </p>
<ul>
<li>"You shall have no other gods before me... for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God," (Exod. 20:3-5).</li></ul></p>
<p>
In their writings, the Old Testament, they emphatically proclaimed one God, the God by whom all creation exists.</p>
<ul>
<li>"...that you might know that the Lord Himself is God; there is none other besides Him." (Deut. 4:35).</li>
<li>"The Lord our God, the Lord is one!" (Deut. 6:4).</li>
<li>"You alone are the Lord; You have made heaven,The heaven of heavens, with all their host, The earth and everything on it, The seas and all that is in them," (Neh. 9:6).</li>
<li>"You are God, You alone, of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have made heaven and earth." (Isa. 37:16).</li>
<li>"For thus says the Lord, Who created the heavens, Who is God, Who formed the earth and made it, Who has established it,... I am the LORD; and there is no other" (Isa. 45:18).</li>
<li>"And there is no other God besides Me, A just God and a Saviour; There is none besides Me." (Isa. 45:21).</li>
<li>"But the LORD is the true God, He is the living God ... He that made the earth by His power" (Jer. 10:10-12).</li></ul></p>

<h2>The Spirit of God</h2>
<p>
These men of Israel also proclaimed the reality of the spirit of God; but, they never addressed this spirit as a separate personage, as another god. The faithful Jew of old never entertained the thought of God’s spirit as another coequal god. As revealed in their writings, the spirit of God was the power, the favour, the influence, emanating from God.</p>
<ul>
<li>"And I have filled him with the Spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship," (Exod. 31:3).</li>
<li>""The Spirit of the Lord came upon him, and he judged Israel." (Judg. 3:10).</li>
<li>"You send forth Your Spirit, they are created;"(Psa. 104:30)</li>
<li>"The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him, The Spirit of wisdom and understanding, The Spirit of counsel and might, The Spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord" (Isa. 11:2).</li>
<li>"I will pour My Spirit on your descendants, And My blessing on your offspring;" (Isa. 44:3).</li>
<li>"I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes" (Ezek. 36:27).</li>
<li>"I will put My Spirit in you, and you shall live," (Ezek. 37:14).</li>
<li>" I will pour out My Spirit on all flesh" (Joel 2:28).</li></ul>
<p>
Hence, the Old Testament is monotheistic. YHWH alone is God. The spirit is an extension of God, not a separate, coequal, entity.</p>
<li>"Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence?" (Psa. 139:7).</li></ul>

<h2>The God of Jesus</h2>
<p>
From His own words we find Jesus of Nazareth believed as did the faithful Jews that preceded Him.</p>
<ul>
<li>"I thank thee, O Father Lord of heaven and earth" (Matt. 11:25).</li>
<li>"Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord" (Mark 12:29).</li>
<li>"That they might know thee, the only true God" (John 17:3).</li></ul>
<p>
The title given Jesus, the Son of God (Matt. 16:16; 8:29), conveyed the relationship he enjoyed. At no time did he present himself as coequal with the Father (Phil. 2:6).</p>
<ul>
<li>"And He said, “Abba, Father, all things are possible for You. Take this cup away from Me; nevertheless, not what I will, but what You will." (Mark 14:36).</li>
<li>"But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father." (Mark 13:32).</li>
<li>"I am going to the Father, for My Father is greater than I." (John 14:28).</li></ul>
<p>
Jesus continually pointed to His subordinate position to His Father.</p>
<ul>
<li>"All things have been delivered to Me by My Father," (Matt. 11:27).</li>
<li>"just as My Father bestowed one upon Me," (Luke 22:29).</li>
<li>"Father,into Your hands I commit My spirit" (Luke 23:46).</li>
<li>"For as the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son to have life in Himself," (John 5:26).</li>
<li>"The Father who sent Me." (John 8:16, 18; 12:49; 14:24).</li>
<li>"as My Father taught Me," (John 8:28).</li>
<li>"as the Father gave Me commandment, so I do." (John 14:31).</li>
<li>"My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Matt. 27:46).</li>
As the Apostle Paul wrote:  [Jesus] who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God," (Phil. 2:6 ).</li></ul>
<p>
Jesus not only used the manner of the Old Testament when speaking of God, but also when speaking of the spirit of God, the holy Spirit.</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>"But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God" (Matt. 12:28).</li>
<li>"The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me" (Luke 4:18).</li>
<li>"Behold, I send the Promise of My Father upon you; but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high." (Luke 24:49).</li></ul>
<p>
John the Baptist spoke the same.
<ul>
<li>"for God does not give the Spirit by measure." (John 3:34)</li>
<li>The Apostle John, when explaining Jesus’ words, wrote: "But this He spoke concerning the Spirit, whom those believing in Him would receive" (John 7:39).</li></ul>
<p>
Thus we see the God of Jesus was the God of Israel. Jesus did not teach a different God. His understanding of the spirit of God was the same. He was monotheistic. His God was the God of the Jews.<p> 
<p>
"I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God." (John 20:17).
