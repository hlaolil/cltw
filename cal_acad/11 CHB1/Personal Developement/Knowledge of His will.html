Knowledge of His will
</h1>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">"For this reason we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding" (Col 1:9)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
This verse begins the body of the epistle. Paul begins with a prayer for the Colossians that touches all the bases of their need. This is one of the greatest prayers of the Bible. </p>
<p>
Paul first begins with intercession for the Colossians and then moves to thanks for what God has already done for them. <br>It is ironic that Christians ask God to do things for them He has already done. We ask God to forgive us for our sins when we already have forgiven us in Christ (Col 1:14). We ask God to allow us to enter His kingdom, when He has already done that as well (Col 1:13). It is more proper to thank God for these things than to ask Him for them.</p>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">"For this reason we also"</dr class="alt5">
</p>
<p>
"This reason" is their original reception of the gospel (Col 1:3-8). Paul prays for them (Col 1:9-14) because of their reception to the gospel and love for all the saints.</p> 
<p>
<dr class="alt5">"since the day we heard it"</dr class="alt5">
</p>
<p>
They heard it from Epaphras. The news of their response to the gospel led to a prayer request. This prayer answers to their faith.</p>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">"do not cease to pray for you"</p></dr class="alt5">
<p>
This is one of the remarkable prayers of the apostle Paul. Other prayers of Paul can be found in Eph 1, 3, Phil 1, II Thess 1. When we read his prayers we are at a high water mark of spirituality in the New Testament. <br>We ought to be at our best in prayer. When we pray we enter the presence of God. The white heat of that presence should melt away spiritual superficiality and sham. Pretension dissolves in God's presence.<br>

This is incessant prayer but it does not mean that Paul prayed for them perpetually. It simply means that he prayed for them on a regular basis. We should pray for people regularly (Acts 20:31; Eph. 1:16; I Thes. 1:2; 5:17). Many people do not cease because they do not start.</p> 
<p>
<font size="+1">Principle:</font><br>
Dead earnestness is essential to true prayer.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Application:</font><br> 
We need to seize every opportunity to pray. Prayer is the place where we fight spiritual battles. Do you have a spirit of prayer? Do you seize every opportunity to pray for people you may influence? Are we dead earnest about prayer? We believe in prayer but we do not pray very much. We subscribe to the idea of prayer but when we announce a prayer meeting a minimum number of people come. We believe in prayer if an emergency lands into our lives. Otherwise, we show little interest in prayer. We are eloquent in prayer if it involves our family or our person. If it involves someone else we are quite casual about prayer.</p> 
<p>
In the prayers of the New Testament we detect the deficiencies of the saints. Paul prays for things they lacked in their spiritual life.<br> Paul's prayers pinpoint the primary and paramount needs of the saints.<br> 

This prayer falls into two halves. The first half are petitions for the Colossians and the second half is thanksgiving for the prerogatives God gave them in Christ.</p> 
<p>
<dr class="alt5">"and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will"</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
This is the first of two requests Paul prays for the Colossians. The first petition for which Paul asked was that the Colossians might be filled with the knowledge of God's will. 

This is the outcome of a great desire. The word "ask" means to implore. It denotes earnestness. This is a request of great earnestness.<br>

"That" is the purpose of the prayer request. 

The word "knowledge" means to go beyond the surface of the facts. It sees the truth in the facts. It finds experience in the truth. This is a full knowledge gained from the experience of concentrating on the subject. The operating principle here is the will of God is contained in the Word of God. We cannot know the will of God apart from the Word of God. God has not revealed His special will in nature, in trees and flowers. God's will never contradicts His Word. God's will never transcends the principles of His Word.</p> 
<p>
The word "filled" suggests filling to the top or brim. Paul prays that they will be satisfied with nothing less than the limit of the knowledge of God's will. He wants them to obtain an entire insight into the will of God. "Filled" means to be controlled to the tiniest detail. We need to know the will of God not only in major decisions of life but in the little decisions as well. It is to pervade our purpose, plans and thoughts.</p> 
<p>
Most of us are satisfied with being half-filled with everything except food.<br>We do not stop eating until we are full. We are not that way when it comes to spiritual food. We are satisfied with a starvation diet in spiritual things. <br>We snack on spiritual junk food and run off to the spiritual race only to run with very little spiritual energy. It is God's will that we be filled with spiritual food. Most of us are not even half full. God wants us to be chock-block full of the knowledge of the will of God. God wants us to be experts in the will of God. If God answers this prayer we will know all the implications of His will for our lives.</p> 
<p>
<font size="+1">Principle:</font><br> 
Unless we are speaking terms with the will of God we will have little wisdom and understanding in the spiritual battle we face. </p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Application:</font> <br>
If we have little spiritual discernment we will get caught up in every spiritual disease that comes along. We will be susceptible to unsound teaching. Dr. Harry Ironside used to say, "If it's new, it's not true. If it's true, it's not new." We need to take care before we embrace anything that is different or new. If it deviates from the Bible we need to be cautious.</p>
<p>
The first thing Paul prays for the Colossians is that they will be filled with the knowledge of God's will. The will of God is a great theme in Scripture.</p>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">"and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will"</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Note the number of passages dealing with the will of God:

John 7, <dr class="alt5">"If anyone wills to do His will, he shall know concerning the doctrine, whether it is from God or whether I speak on My own authority." (John 7:17)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
We must be willing to do His will, sight unseen. We must be willing to do his will before we even know what it is. We say, "Well, I will consider whether the will of God fits my personality, then I will do it." No, God wants us to be willing to do His will no matter the cost. </p>
<p>
God will leave us in the dark about His will if we are not willing to do it. God is willing to reveal His will to us if we are willing to ascertain it. We dare not say to God, "I would like a free, 30 day trial, of your will. If I like it, I will do it." We will never know the will of God in that case.</p> 
<p>
We cannot dictate to God the terms on which we will condescend to do His will. God does not have to make a deal with us. He does not need us; we need Him. We do not bankrupt the will of God when we do not do it; we bankrupt ourselves. We cannot blackmail God.<br>

<dr class="alt5">"Therefore do not be unwise, but understand what the will of the Lord is." <br>(Eph 5:17)</dr class="alt5"> <br>
It is not enough to know the will of God, we need to understand it. We do not need a Ph.D from our local university to understand it either. </p>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">"I beseech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service. And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God." (Rom 12:1,2)</dr class="alt5"><br>
We cannot prove the will of God until we "present" or yield our bodies to God for His use. We cannot prove the will of God until we are free from the gravitational tug of the world.</p> 
<p>
Many other verses speak to the will of God: (Matt 7:21;12:50; Acts 21:14;
2 Cor 8:5;Heb 10:36;13:20,21;I Peter 3:17; 2:15; 4:1,2 ;I John 2:17)</p>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">"Epaphras, who is one of you, a bond servant of Christ, greets you, always labouring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God." (Col 4:12)</dr class="alt5"> <br>
Epaphras was completely in the will of God. He was not on the edge of it. He was dead centre in the will of God. He was not on the periphery of God's will.</p> 
<p>
<dr class="alt5">"For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell asleep, was buried with his fathers, and saw corruption." (Acts 13:32)</dr class="alt5"><br>
David fulfilled all of God's will. We feel that if we fulfil three quarters of God's will we do fine. "That is a good average. Why should God ask for anything more?" What percentage of obedience do we want from our children?</p>
<p>
Jesus did the will of God: John 4:34; 6:38-40; Matt 26:39</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Principle:</font><br> 
God expects us to do His will unreservedly.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Application:</font><br>
Are you willing to do whatever God asks of you?
<p>
<dr class="alt5">"with the knowledge of His will"</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
The word "knowledge" indicates a full understanding of God's will. This word is a key word in the book of Col (1:9, 10; 2:2; 3:10). </p>
<p>
God makes His will known through the Holy Spirit's teaching ministry in the Word of God. The false teachers at Colossi claimed a super knowledge to the Word of God. Paul prays that the Colossians will receive their super knowledge from God's Word (Colossians). Paul's desire is that they may have a thorough knowledge of God's will. The Colossian renegades offered a false knowledge. To counteract this Paul prayed for a deeper knowledge of God's will on their part. </p>
<p>
The will of God here is the whole purpose of God in Christ. This is the will of God in the complete sense, not simply the will of God for salvation or his general decree. This is the will of God both in belief and behaviour. The most important thing in the life of a child of God is the will of God. <br>If we are going to please God, we need to find out what His will is and do it.<br> If I want the smile of God, I need to find His will. </p>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">"in all wisdom and spiritual understanding"</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
The Holy Spirit uses the word "wisdom" six times in Colossians (Col. 1:9, 28; 2:3, 23; 3:16; 4:5). Wisdom is the application of truth to experience. It is the ability to apply truth to life that comes only from God (James 1:5; 3:15). Wisdom is insight into the true nature of things. It is the faculty of judging and acting aright. "Full knowledge" is not the end; it is the means. The end is the wisdom to apply truth to experience. </p>
<p>
False teachers submitted only the "appearance" of wisdom" (Col 2:23). Their "wisdom" trapped the Colossians in legalism. So the "wisdom" for which Paul prays for them is prudence. It is the ability to look at actions in terms of their results.</p>
<p>
When we apply truth to experience we end up with "spiritual understanding." This is the ability to categorise and relate a principle to a problem. "Understanding" (Col. 2:2) is perspicacity or discernment. This is the ability to pierce into a problem and work it to an adequate solution. Understanding is critical knowledge that can apply the knowledge of the first principles of Christianity to any situation. This is the ability to live the Christian life effectively.</p> 
<p>
There is emphasis on "spiritual" in the original language. This is knowledge from the Holy Spirit, not from the Gnostic Judaisers. The false teacher's wisdom was all show (Col 2:8,18,23). The most clever human philosophy can never understand this apart from divine revelation. This revelation comes by the Bible. No matter how erudite and brilliant people may be, they cannot get "full-knowledge" without God disclosing divine information to them.</p> 
<p>
Note the word "all." This is a key word in Colossians. The word occurs no fewer than 32 times in this one little letter of four chapters. This word applies to both "wisdom" and "understanding." We need "all" wisdom and "all" understanding.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Principle:</font><br> 
It is one thing to have knowledge; it is another thing to use that knowledge properly.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Application:</font><br> 
Are you the type of person who loves to acquire knowledge about Christianity but care little about living it? The words "wisdom" and "understanding" are crucial to you. Those words will enable you to live out the Christian life. That is why Paul prayed that the Colossians would have "all" "wisdom" and "understanding." Do you have the courage to pray that God will give you those graces to live the Christian life? If you are frustrated with your Christian life, these two qualities may be the answer to your problem</p>
