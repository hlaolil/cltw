 <h1>
Time for God's Counsel
</h1>
<p>
I was raised to believe in the importance of a "quiet time." To the surprise of some, the original idea of that concept came from the Lord Himself.
Throughout the Scriptures are references to the value of waiting for the Lord and spending time with God. <br>On such occasions, the debris we have gathered during the hurried, busy hours of our day gets filtered out, not unlike the silt that settles where a river widens, and we are able to see things more clearly, to feel God's nudging more sensitively.</p>
<h3>
David's Quiet time
</h3>
<p>
David frequently underscored the benefits of solitude. I am certain he first became acquainted with this discipline as he kept his father's sheep.<br> Later, during those tumultuous years when King Saul was borderline insane and pursuing him out of jealousy, David found his time with God not only a needed refuge but his means of survival.</p>
<p>
When he wrote,<dr class="alt5">"Wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and He shall strengthen your heart; wait, I say, on the Lord!" (Psa 27:14)</dr class="alt5">, David was intimately acquainted with what that meant.<br> When he admitted,<dr class="alt5">"I waited patiently for the Lord; and He inclined to me and heard my cry" (Psa 40:1)</dr class="alt5">, it was not out of a context of unrealistic theory.<br>The man was hurting, deeply pained. <br>And when he tore a page from his journal and used it to compose Psalm 26, <dr class="alt5">"Vindicate me, O Lord, for I have walked in my integrity. I have also trusted in the Lord; I shall not slip. Examine me, O Lord, and prove me;
try my mind and my heart." (Psa 26:1–2)</dr class="alt5">, he wasn't whipping up a few emotional thoughts to wow the reader. <br>Those words splashed from the depths of his troubled soul, like the salty spray that explodes when waves crash against the rocks.</p>
<h3>
Job's Quiet time
</h3>
<p>
Time with God? Who experienced its value more than Job after he lost everything he owned? In worship he wrote: <dr class="alt5">"Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked I shall return there. The Lord gave and the Lord has taken away. Blessed be the name of the Lord" (Job 1:21)</dr class="alt5">. <br>And Job's quiet trust didn't wear thin; the man continued to commune with God. <br>Remember his confession? What makes it even more remarkable is that he stated it while surrounded by those who accused him:
<dr class="alt5">
"But He knows the way I take; when He has tried me, I shall come forth as gold. My foot has held fast to His steps; I have kept His way and not turned aside. I have not departed from the commandment of His lips; I have treasured the words of His mouth more than my necessary food." (Job 23:10–12)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
That is exactly what occurs when we get alone, remove ourselves deliberately from the fast track, and keep our appointment with Him who made us. <br>What great thoughts He has for us, what insights, what comfort and what reassurance! <br>The best part of all is that such divine breakthroughs come so unexpectedly. <br>Though you and I may each have met in solitude with God morning after morning, suddenly there comes that one day, like none other, when He reveals His plan ... and we're blown away.</p>
<h3>
Moses' Quiet time 
</h3>
<p>
It happened to Moses. Alone with his father-in-law Jethro's flock of sheep on the backside of the desert, perhaps after the howling night winds of the wilderness had settled and the searing rays of the Sinai sun began to peek over the awesome slopes of Horeb, God spoke from the midst of a bush that was strangely ablaze. <br>And what was it God said? What was it that the 80-year-old, over-the-hill shepherd heard? In effect, "Lead the exodus!" The night before, who would've ever guessed that an otherwise ordinary dawn would find the old man reeling in disbelief? Least of all, Moses.</p>
<p>
F. B. Meyer(1847–1929. British preacher, author etc.) wrote thus:
There are days in all of our lives that come unannounced, unheralded. No angel faces look out of heaven; no angel voices put us on our guard; but as we look back on them in later years, we realise that they were the turning points of our existence. Perhaps we look longingly back on the uneventful routine of the life that lies beyond them, but the angel, with drawn sword, forbids our return and compels us forward. It was so with Moses.</p>
<p>
Understand, those phenomenal moments are the exception, not the rule. <br>If God spoke to us like that on an everyday basis, burning bushes would be as commonplace as traffic lights and ringing phones.<br> Fact is, never again in all of time has the voice of God been heard from a bush that refused to be consumed with flames. You see, God does original works, not duplicated recordings. <br>But never doubt it: He still longs to speak to waiting hearts, hearts that are quiet before Him.<br> As David wrote in one of his psalms:<br>
<dr class="alt5">
For this cause everyone who is godly shall pray to You in a time when You may be found; surely in a flood of great waters they shall not come near him.
You are my hiding place; You shall preserve me from trouble; You shall surround me with songs of deliverance. I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will guide you with My eye. (Psa 32:6–8)</dr class="alt5"></p>
