Pray for God's Wisdom
</h1>
<p>
A growing number of people in our world fail to seek God for His wisdom. Instead, they strive to satisfy their passions and desires without regard to their futures or to the consequences of their decisions.</p>
<p>
This is a spiritually dangerous way to live. When we try to live apart from the counsel of God’s wisdom, we suffer disillusionment, fear, doubt, worry, and frustration.<br> Our lives fall apart when we do not involve the Saviour in our decisions.
<br>
The wisest approach to life’s challenges is to seek God for His plan, direction, and spiritual insight. But how can we do that? The next time you face a challenge or an important decision, seek God’s wisdom by doing the following:</p>
<p>
<h3>Seek Him—</h3><p>If you want to know God’s heart on a given issue or when you have to make a difficult decision, ask Him. Take time to pray—but in your times of prayer, don’t do all the talking. Listen for God’s still, small voice whispering His words of guidance and encouragement to you.</p>
<p>
<h3>Meditate on God’s Word—</h3><p>You will gain insight into God’s mind and heart by studying Scripture and meditating on its truth. Difficult decisions become easier to make when God is the One guiding you.</p>
<p>
<h3>Obey the principles of Scripture—</h3><p>When you set your heart on obeying God, He will teach you how to apply His truth in your life. Then you will know the way of wisdom.</p>
<p>
<h3>Observe the faithfulness of God—</h3><p>The Lord has never failed to keep a single promise He has made. The Bible is full of testimonies that celebrate His goodness and love. Learn to claim His promises as you read His Word.</p>
<p>
<h3>Heed godly counsel—</h3><p>God can use a pastor or trusted Christian friend to help you see beyond your weaknesses. Don’t hesitate to share your needs and fears with those who love the Lord and you.</p>
<p>
<h3>Associate with wise people—</h3><p>Choose your friends wisely. Include God in every relationship, and you will establish a strong, godly base of counsellors to support you in making wise decisions.</p>
<p>
Because God loves us, we have no need to worry about the future. He has a plan, not only for our lives, but also for every problem we face. <br>Oswald Chambers said, “All our fret and worry is caused by calculating without God.” Take time today to renew your trust in God and His ability to provide the wisdom you need. </p>
