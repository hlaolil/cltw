Misplaced Time
</h1>
<p>
Time management is important because of the brevity (shortness) of our lives. Our earthly sojourn is significantly shorter than we are inclined to think. As David so aptly points out, <dr class="alt5">“You have made my days as hand breadths, and my age is as nothing before You; Certainly every man at his best state is but vapour” (Psa 39:4-5)</dr class="alt5">. The apostle James echoes this: <dr class="alt5">“For what is your life? It is even a vapour that appears for a little time and then vanishes away.” (James 4:14)</dr class="alt5">. Indeed, our time on earth barely registers on the eternal radar screen. To live as God would have us live, it is essential we make the best possible use of our allotted time.</p>
<p>
Moses prays, <dr class="alt5">“Teach us to number our days, that we may gain a heart of wisdom” (Psa 90:12)</dr class="alt5">. A good way to gain wisdom is to learn to live each day with an eternal perspective. <br>Our Creator has set eternity in our hearts (Eccl 3:11).<br> Knowing that we will have to give an account to the One who gives us time should motivate us to use it well. C. S. Lewis understood this: “If you read history you will find that the Christians who did the most for the present world were just those who thought most of the next.”</p>
<p>
In his letter to the Ephesians, Paul cautioned the saints, <dr class="alt5">“See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil.” (Eph 5:15-16)</dr class="alt5">. Living wisely involves using our time carefully. Knowing that the harvest is great and the workers are few, and that time is rapidly dwindling should help us make better use of our time to witness.</p>
<p>
There is no doubt that the responsibilities and pressures of this world scream for our attention. The myriad of things pulling us in different directions makes it all too easy for our time to get swallowed up in mundane, lesser matters. Those endeavours which have eternal value, then, often get relegated to the back burner. To avoid losing focus, we need to prioritise and set goals. Additionally, to whatever extent possible, we need to delegate.<br> Recall how Moses’ father-in-law Jethro wisely taught him to delegate some of his heavy work load (Ex 18:13-22).</p>
<p>
Regarding our work ethic, we need to recall that God did all of His work in six days and rested on the seventh. This ratio of work to rest sheds light on our Creator’s expectations relative to our own work ethic.<br> Indeed, Prov 6 reveals the Lord’s disdain for slothful behaviour: <br><dr class="alt5">“A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep— So shall your poverty come on you like a prowler,” (Prov 6:10-11)</dr class="alt5"><br> (see also Prov 12:24; 13:4; 18:9; 20:4; 21:25; 26:14). <br>Furthermore, the Parable of the Talents (Matt 25:14-30) illustrates the tragedy of wasted opportunity as well as the importance of labouring faithfully until the Lord comes.</p>
<p>
We need to place our focus on that which is eternal as opposed to the fleeting pleasures of this passing world. Accordingly, we should move forward with diligence and divine purpose as the courses of our lives progress toward God’s ultimate goal. We are to accomplish as much as we can with the time He has given us. <dr class="alt5">If anyone’s work which he has built on it endures, he will receive a reward. (1 Cor 3:14)</dr class="alt5">.<br> <p style="text-align:center"><font color="red">We should live as if each minute counts – because it really does.</font></p>
