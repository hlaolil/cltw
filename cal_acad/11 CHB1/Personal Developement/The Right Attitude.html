 <h1>
The Right Attitude
</h1>
<p>
Solomon said long ago, <dr class="alt5">“Keep your heart with all diligence, for out of it spring the issues of life” (Prov. 4:23)</dr class="alt5">.<br> Nowhere is this advice more important than in the area of our attitudes.<br> The “heart” Solomon spoke of involves more than attitudes, of course, but no one can deny that our attitudes are a significant part of the heart that requires “keeping.”<br> Even those with the best of intentions sometimes find their attitudes beginning to slip out of line. We need to monitor our attitudes closely and at the first sign of deterioration, bring them back to where God wants them to be. If we don’t do that, our lives will turn out to be the kind of lives we never wanted to live.</p>
<h3>
Wrong and Right Attitude
</h3>
<p>
Just as wrong attitudes hinder us from being what we ought to be, right attitudes help us to please God and do His work faithfully. Like the woodcutter who makes his work go much easier by taking the time to sharpen his axe (Eccl. 10:10), we do ourselves a big favour in the Lord’s work by adjusting our attitudes in a good direction. There is no greater advantage we can give ourselves in the work of the local congregation than to make sure our attitudes are correct. Not only does the work get done more effectively, but we enjoy it more when we have the right mental “slant” on it.<br> This is an advantage that all of us are capable of giving ourselves.</p>
<p>
The problem most of us have, though, is assuming that our attitudes are acceptable, when in reality they may have become detrimental to the work. Attitudes have a way of slipping without our noticing. That is why periodic self-examinations — and they need to be honest examinations — are so needed.<br> Doing the Lord’s work effectively requires many mid-course corrections.</p>
<p>
Let’s think about the importance of attitudes and determine to be more careful about our own. Local congregations are blessed with members who have numerous talents and abilities that are needed in the work God has given us to do. Those abilities can’t be productive if the matter of attitude is not given some priority. While there are a number of things in life that we can do nothing about, attitude is something we can always improve. <br>Let’s determine that our work will be helped, and not hindered, by the way we choose to think.</p>
<h3>
Some ways to improve our Attitude
</h3>
<p>
<font size="+1">Key Idea</font><br> 
God wants us to think as we should so that we can be fruitful in good works.
<dr class="alt5">that you may walk worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing Him, being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God; strengthened with all might, according to His glorious power, for all patience and long suffering with joy; giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in the light. (Col 1:9-12)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Key Idea</font><br> 
We need to love God with all our heart, soul, and mind.<br>
<dr class="alt5">when the Pharisees heard that He had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together. Then one of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him, and saying, “Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?”
Jesus said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like it: You shall love your neighbour as yourself". (Matt 22:34-39)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Key Idea</font><br> 
We need to be humble about ourselves and do our work faithfully.<br>
<dr class="alt5">"... to everyone who is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, as God has dealt to each one a measure of faith. For as we have many members in one body, but all the members do not have the same function, ..." (Rom 12:1-8)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Key Idea</font><br>  
We need to put the interests of our brethren ahead of our own interests.<br>
<dr class="alt5">Therefore if there is any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any affection and mercy, fulfil my joy by being like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself. Let each of you look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others. (Phil 2:1-4)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Key Idea</font><br>  
We need to work for the Lord generously and cheerfully.<br>
<dr class="alt5">"Brothers, we want to tell you about the kindness that God showed to the churches in Macedonia. Even when they were suffering a severe test of their belief, their joy was great. Although they were very poor, their gifts were very generous. I can assure you about this. They gave as much as they could. They gave even more than they could afford. Nobody forced them to do this. ..." <br>(2 Cor 9:1-8)</dr class="alt5">
