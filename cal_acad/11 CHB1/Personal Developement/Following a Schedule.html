Following a Schedule
</h1>
<p>
“It seems to be human nature to finish what we start and, if it is not finished, we experience dissonance.”
It’s the same thing that happens when we become engaged in a story in a book, movie or TV show: we want to see how it ends!</p>
<p>
You can use this knowledge to your advantage by just getting started on that next big project, knowing that first step really is an important one in being productive.

Once you’ve gotten started though, you need better methods of staying productive and engaging in “deliberate practice” in order to avoid doing busy work.</p>
<h3>
How to Work Like an Expert
</h3>
<p>
A multitude of research has shown us that discipline is best maintained through habits, not through willpower.

It appears that most people hold their productivity back by not rigidly scheduling work and rest breaks throughout the day.<br>

Since most of us are worried about our willpower, we don’t push ourselves to our maximum productive output: instead of “giving our all” for brief productivity sessions, we distribute our effort throughout the day, leading us back to busywork to fill our time.</p>
<h3>
What should we do instead?
</h3>
<p>
A research study conducted by the Federal Aviation Administration revealed how short breaks between longer working sessions resulted in a 16% improvement in awareness and focus.</p>
<p>
Research matches up with these findings: longer productive sessions (of 90 minutes) followed by short breaks (of no more than 15-20 minutes) sync more closely with our natural energy cycles and allow us to maintain a better focus and higher energy level throughout the day.</p>
<p>
It’s hard to be productive while trying to maintain high energy levels through your entire day.<br>

It’s much easier for your brain to approach a 90-minute session of productivity when it knows that a 15-minute break is coming up afterwards.</p>
<p>
Instead of trying to conserve your energy for multiple hours, we are at our most productive when we break big projects down into smaller chunks and plan a recovery period right after.</p>
<p>
For projects done on your own time, try scheduling blocks of 90-minute work sessions with a planned cool down time of 15 minutes directly afterwards. When you know a break is on the horizon, you won’t try to “pace yourself” with your work, and will be more inclined to dive into the difficult stuff.</p>
<p>
While great for tackling the toughest parts of large projects, this technique doesn’t really address many problems related to discipline, an important part of staying productive for more than just a day or two.</p>
<p>
Fortunately, we have research in this area that will change the way you approach discipline and that will get you to start using systems to maintain and track your progress.</p>
<h3>
The Art of Staying Disciplined
</h3>
<p>
In a study examining the ability of average people to stick with a strict dieting plan, researchers found that those participants who rigorously monitored what they were eating were able to maintain far higher levels of self-control when it came to maintaining their diet.</p>
<p>
A study involving college students found that students who imposed strict deadlines on themselves for assignments performed far better (and more consistently) than those who didn’t.<br>

These findings were especially interesting because students who gave themselves too generous of a deadline often suffered from the same problems as students who set zero deadlines: when you allot yourself too much time to complete a task, you can end up creating a “mountain out of a molehill”.</p>
<p>
Since we now know that tracking our progress is a key component of productivity, how can we implement this practice into our daily routine?<br>

One method is to use an Accountability Chart to track what work you’ve completed during your 90-minute productive sessions, similar to how the dieters tracked their food consumption.</p>
<p>
To easily implement one into your daily routine, simply create two-columns on a piece of paper, Google Docs spreadsheet, or even a whiteboard.<br>

Column 1 will list the time-span of one of your productivity sessions.<br>
Column 2 will list what tasks you’ve accomplished in that limited time-span.
<h3>
Accountability Chart
</h3>
<p>
Don’t include any columns for your 15-minute breaks, as those times are for your own sake and means to replenish your willpower.<br>

This seemingly simple strategy works incredibly well for two very specific reasons:<br>

Tracking your progress in this way has been proven to increase self-control because you’ll be exposed to the work you’ve actually accomplished, and not the (inaccurate) assumption of work you might construe in your head. <br>(Forcing yourself to write down the fact that you spent two hours on the Internet doing no work guilt trips you into not doing it again;).</p>
<p>
Progress tracking is also a known strategy for stopping yourself from engaging in “robotic behaviour” (also known as busy work or busyness), a habit described as the number one enemy of goal striving.</p>
<h3>
Productivity & Multitasking
</h3>
<p>
With a work schedule, an energy management strategy and a task-tracking system in place, the last challenge we have to face is that of multitasking.</p>
<p>
The danger surrounding multitasking lies in how our brains perceive it: according to a 1999 study, we have a tendency to view multitasking as really effective from the outside… after all, shouldn’t productivity increase if we are doing multiple things at once?</p>
<p>
The science shows us that this is an absolute falsehood:<br> A researcher was able to show that on average, multi taskers are actually less likely to be productive, yet they feel more “emotionally satisfied” with their work (creating an illusion of productivity).</p>
<p>
Worse yet, a researcher examined the work patterns of multi taskers and analysed their ability to:<br>

Filter information<br>
Switch between tasks<br>
Maintain a high working memory<br>
... and found that they were terrible at all three!</p>
<h3>
According to the researcher:
</h3>
<p>
“We were absolutely shocked. We all lost our bets. It turns out multi taskers are terrible at every aspect of multitasking.”
How can we fight back?</p>
<p>
The best way is to simply block ourselves from distracting elements that may cause us to multi task.<br>

When working on the computer, be sure to use tools like Controlled multi-tab browsing and StayFocusd (Chrome extensions) to block distracting sites and limit the amount of tabs you can have open.</p>
<p>
The next best strategy is to create an evening planning ritual where you select a few priority tasks to accomplish the next day.</p>
<p>
The reason this method works far better than planning your daily tasks in the morning is because research has shown that we drastically miscalculate the amount of focus we’ll be able to maintain in the future: that is, we strongly believe that we’ll be able to quickly plan our day the next morning, but when tomorrow rolls around without a game plan to get us started, we’ll likely fall back into our old multitasking ways to avoid doing any real work.<br>
