 <h1>
Unlocking the Truth
</h1>
<p>
A fundamental biblical concept here is that guidance into truth can only come from the 'Holy Spirit' or the 'Spirit of truth'. Jesus said :
<dr class="alt5">"when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come." (John 16.13)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
So who is the Spirit of truth? According to the Bible He is a person, the third person of the Godhead (The Trinity). He is sent into the world by God to help and guide those who put their trust in Jesus Christ.
The gift of the Spirit is specific to believers <dr class="alt5">the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He dwells with you and will be in you (John 14.17)</dr class="alt5"> and so in this sense, truth is supernaturally revealed. Unbelievers cannot receive this revelation.<br> Put another way, the Holy Spirit 'unlocks' truth.</p>
<h3>
The Source of Truth
</h3>
<p>
Jesus said that He Himself is the source of all truth. 
<dr class="alt5">"I am the way, the truth, and the life." (John 14.6)</dr class="alt5">
Here Jesus is claiming all truth (including biblical truth) comes from Himself. Since He is 'one' with the Father, He reveals truth originating from the Godhead and the Holy Spirit is the mechanism if truth revelation. Moreover, Jesus claimed that absolute truth exists by being dogmatic on such issues as heaven and hell, morality, creation, judgement and the need for reconciliation to God. Christians are often accused of being fundamentalist or dogmatic, but they are simply following biblical teaching - which claims to be transcendent.</p>
<p>
If you follow Jesus, ask Him to guide you as you grapple with difficult issues. His Spirit will guide you.
If you do not know Jesus, first ask Him to come into your life. Jesus will then send His Spirit to help you unlock biblical truths. <br>Of course, being fallible humans we can never grasp the complete truth, but we can certainly be supernaturally guided towards absolute truths. <br>As Paul says:
<dr class="alt5">Now I know in part, but then (in the resurrection) I will know fully" (1 Cor 13.12)</dr class="alt5">
