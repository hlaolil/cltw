Disorganisation symptoms

<h3>
Cluttered desk
</h3>
<p>
Flat surfaces should be kept clear. The only stuff in the radius of your arms should be the stuff you need immediately. Boxes of pens, staplers and stacks of files need to go. Instead, rid your desk of visual clutter by paring down the items on top to the essentials only. For most, that means a monitor and keyboard, telephone, two pens, one notebook, a drinking glass, lamp and one family photograph in your most-used workspace. Additional office supplies should be kept in desk drawers and other items placed in their designated zones.Eliminate</p> 

<font size="+.1">Digital Clutter</font>

<p>
Digital clutter can be just as stressful and energy-sapping as physical clutter. Most people spend at least 30 minutes to an hour a day looking for things. Instead, organise digital files and your email in-box just as you would paper files–with a system of logical and clearly labelled folders. Also, keep the icons on your screen to a bare minimum, and trade in sticky notes on your monitor for calendar reminders.</p>
<h3>
Condition of your car
</h3>
<p>
Having a clean car isn’t just a sign of neatness, it is a safety feature. Car organisation prevents accidents. Accidents are frequently caused by objects shifting in a car or rolling under the driver’s feet. Car organisation includes trash disposal.
Your car boot is an often overlooked upon car organisation. An unorganised boot is a disaster in the event of a flat tire or a roadside emergency. You will not regret your car boot organisation when you don’t have to clear your boot at the side of a highway</p>
<h3>
Low self-esteem. 
</h3>
<p>
Low self-esteem is the feeling of insecurity when one is not comfortable with himself or herself.
Esteem again means “to set a high value on: regard highly and prize accordingly.” In other words, the process of boosting your self-esteem starts with deciding that you are valuable and treating yourself as such.</p>
<p>
Believe in yourself.  The first step in creating greater self-esteem is to believe in yourself. It’s your responsibility to take charge of your own self-concept and your beliefs – including belief in your worth, your talent, your abilities, and your potential. </p>
<p>Keep your agreements.  One of the most commonly overlooked ways to boost self-esteem is to keep your word. Every agreement you make is ultimately to yourself, even those that involve other people. Your brain registers agreements as commitments. If you don’t follow through, you learn to not trust yourself. You lose integrity and faith in your ability to produce a result. Don’t undermine your sense of personal power – keep your commitments.</p> 
<h3>
Forgettery
</h3>
<p>
See then that you walk circumspectly, not as fools but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil. Therefore do not be unwise, but understand what the will of the Lord is (Eph 5:15–17)</dr class="alt5">.
Can someone who is not a sock-arranging, numbers-crunching, paradigm-talking bean counter "redeem the time" for fruitful living and effective ministry? I think so, despite time management workshops that leave me wondering. Typical sessions offer principles
that should help, but I’m not hopeful. The speaker’s time-use skills seldom come across as learned behaviour.
Reality forces us to blend spiritual life and service into the demands of job, school, marriage, and family. Many feel inadequate and frustrated, but are we undisciplined people? I don’t think so. We discipline ourselves to do what we have to do or what we
value most. You probably do better than you give yourself credit for.
Despite our feelings, we get some things done, and sometimes they are significant. We usually meet our deadlines and keep appointments. Maybe we can set our own deadlines
and make our own appointments to leverage us to best results.
The Puritan perspective says, "God never gives up on a man who doesn’t make peace
with his sin." He won’t give up on us either as we try to do our best with all the time, talent, and treasure He’s given us. Time-beaten believers can find healing and release from guilt as we explore how to make our "best" better.</p>
<h3>
Unproductive projects
</h3>
<p>
To develop a meaningful life plan, you need to recognise time management is your responsibility. Time is life—a gift from God and your gift to God. Both the Bible and nature reveal God is organised. If you organise, God can bless it. Jesus instructed His disciples to organise the multitude and serve them systematically. Then, He fed 5,000 with a little boy’s lunch.</p>
<p> 
Elijah set his altar in order before calling down fire from heaven.
God always holds the miracle, but organised obedience is in your hands.</p>
<p>
Successful time management rests on a three-legged stool: desire, design, and discipline.

Analyse your work place and try to identify examples of poor correlation between effort and results. Close inspection may well indicate a number of these examples are caused by genuine reasons, such as resource or operational issues. However it’s quite likely a significant number will be due to busyness.

This is where your time management effort needs to be focused. Busyness doesn’t accomplish anything, it doesn’t deliver results for you, and it ruins any notion of effective time management at work.

You will not use time well unless you want to or plan to, and you will not use time well without self-control. It doesn’t happen at the emotional level. Seal your desire with a decision. Commit to it, even put it in writing. Spell out your strategy, then stick to it.
Desire, decision, design, and discipline will end in delight.</p>
<h3>
Causes of Discontent
</h3>
<p>
You are never satisfied with what you have but keep wishing for something else. When you are never satisfied, you undervalue your accomplishments, have difficulty accepting compliments, and are unable to see value in what you have. Learn to appreciate the now, be engaged in the present moment, and experience what is right in front of you. When you are so busy you have no time to breathe, you cannot focus or enjoy the present moment and often react in unpleasant ways when under stress. </p>
<p>
When you learn to focus your attention, and become organised you lessen your anxiety and increase your level of happiness. You cannot experience happiness and joy in the past or the future. Anxiety takes you out of the now and will have you focus on “what ifs,” creating fantasies about an idealised future. Embrace the moment. Be fully present and engaged in whatever you are doing and enjoy whomever you are with in the moment. </p>
<h3>
Intimacy with God
</h3>
<p>
You may have been looking for ways to stay more organised in your prayer life and needed some sense of order to my scattered prayer life.
Because, the truth is we often make prayer a last resort.
You promise to pray, but forget about your promises until you are in trouble

Sometimes, you get so caught up in your own agenda, you wait until your head hits the pillow for your “quiet time” with the Lord.

Maybe you are not a complete prayer failure. You pray often throughout the day, whilst driving or working in the garden etc.

But your prayer life feels as if something is lacking as if you are  missing out on something really holy because you are so disorganised.

You really felt you needed to reconnect with God in a more intentional, orderly way.

So, you asked friends. And they helped.

They sent emails and Facebook messages. They responded in the comment box. They offered links and tips.

They also let you know that youre not alone. This is a common struggle, and even pastors confess to having trouble at times.

Here is a seven-day prayer chart, posted on the bulletin board in my office. Each day has an emphasis: Mission Monday for friends around the world; Together Tuesday for friends and community; Work Wednesday for daily work; Thirsty Thursday for spiritual growth; Family Friday for immediate and extended family, and a Weekend of Wonder and Worship dedicated to praise and thanksgiving.
<h3>
Breakdown of relationships
</h3>
<p>
To cultivate your relationships, you need to reorganise your time and schedule to make time for personal, face-to-face contacts. It takes a conscious effort to overcome the pressure of everyday problems and deadlines.</p>
<p>
Before heading out on a business trip—whether across the sea, or across town— put together itineraries that expose you to the maximum number of people in the minimum amount of time. It’s the time you take, the personal nature of the service or concern you provide and the very real way that you show you care that matters most.</p>
<p>
In a world that daily becomes less personal as technology expands its grip on the medium of human exchange, form productive relationships with friends etc. Become adept at relationship building and you will have an easier time solving relationship problems with old and new friends by using whatever technology is available.
<h3>
Self Hate 
</h3> 
<p>
Self Hate - what you should do about it now

How does self hate start?

Hating yourself is one of the most destructive things you can do. It will affect your relationships, your confidence and ensure that you will have very low self esteem. In effect, it is a recipe for failure and misery. If you or someone you know suffers from self hate then you will really feel pain as you struggle with life.

Self hate can start because:

you have done something you shouldn't have and you punish yourself for it 
you dislike something about yourself and it grows into stronger feelings of hate
you feel guilty
you are insecure
you have suffered abuse and inside somehow you feel you are partly to blame
you feel a failure
you have no friends
you are too self critical
you don't like your appearance (women and weight issues are especially a big problem) 
Why self hate?

Everyone at some point has negative feelings about themselves. Perhaps you think you are overweight or unattractive. The purpose of this article is to help you change your attitude towards yourself so that you see yourself positively.

Self hate ranges from a dislike of some aspect of yourself - (such as appearance or character), to an intense self loathing. At the extreme end of this scale you may feel angry and depressed. It is important to seek help and start to change how you look at yourself. 

Hating yourself serves no purpose except to ensure that you fail. If you suffer from a victim mentality because of your situation this will ensure you remain a victim confirming your negative thoughts are justified.

Please...it's time to change! Free yourself...

What will it mean to change?

Self hate is the absolute opposite of high self esteem. If you are against yourself you can achieve nothing so you will be stuck in negativity and unhappiness with no hope of escape. Ending it will mean a more positive you ready to take on the world and every challenge it offers you.

Can you imagine liking yourself...even loving yourself? How would that change your outlook and your life?

--you will be like a new person, more successful and happier. Depression and lack of confidence will be a thing of the past...

- So how can you get there? How can you be that more positive person who actually likes her/ himself?

How can you stop self hate and start to like yourself?

This is what I suggest you need to do urgently:-

Build your self confidence
Improve your self esteem
Become less critical
Develop positive self talk
Improve your self image
Consider the good points about who you are what you can do
End negative thoughts
Work on your social skills and your relationships. Friends can really transform your life. Making and keeping friends is a skill like any other.
Deal with depression
Be honest with yourself and try to understand why you feel loathing or dislike towards yourself.</p>
