Dependence
</h2>
<p>
“Until you have given up your self to Him you will not have a real self.” - C.S. Lewis
Dependence starts with surrender. 
Surrender is the act of giving up or yielding oneself or the possession of something to the power of another (dictionary).
You will not experience the abundant life God offers or accomplish the purpose He has planned for you without living a life of surrender and dependence!</p>
<p> 
“There is no pride so dangerous, so subtle and insidious, as the pride of holiness. It is not that a man ever says, or even thinks, “Stay away. I am to sacred for you.” The thought would be considered ludicrous. But unconsciously there can develop a private habit of the soul that feels complacency in its attainments and cannot help but see how far it is ahead of others. It isn’t always seen is self-assertion or self-praise but in the absence of self denial and modesty that reveals a lack of the mark of the soul that has seen the glory of God.” Andrew Murray
In grace, He chooses to use you when you love Him and focus on glorifying Him in humility.</p>
<h3>
Your image does not matter.
</h3>
<p>
James 4:4 – “…Friendship with the world is hatred toward God.”
Your will does not matter.
You can not demand your way.
Your point of view does not matter. 
You gave up control of those to another.
<h3> 
What dependence looks like.
</h3>
<p>
Jesus’ example
A life of dependence is close to God. 
Jer.30:21 – “…Who is he who will devote himself to be close to me?”
A life of dependence is obedient to God. 
John 14:15 – “If you love me you will obey what I command.”
1 John.3:18 – “…Let us not love with words or tongue, but with actions and in truth.”</p>
A life of dependence is a life of meaning and impact. 
John 15:4-5 – “Remain in me and I will remain in you. No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. I am the vine, you are the branches. If a man remains in me and I in him, he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing.”</p>
Dependence means you won’t get your way, you’ll live for him. 
James 4:7 – Submit yourselves then to God…
Eph.5:21 – “Submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.”
“It is easy to think that we humble ourselves before God, but our humility toward others is the only sufficient proof that our humility before God is real.” Andrew Murray</p>
<h2>
Obedience to God
</h2>
<p>
From Genesis to Revelation, the Bible has a lot to say about obedience. In the story of the Ten Commandments, we see how important the concept of obedience is to God. Deuteronomy 11:26–28 sums it up like this: "Obey and you will be blessed. Disobey and you will be cursed."</p>
<p>
In the New Testament, we learn through the example of Jesus Christ that believers are called to a life of obedience.</p>
<h3>
What is the Biblical Definition of Obedience?
</h3>
<p>
The general concept of obedience both in the Old and New Testament relates to hearing or hearkening to a higher authority. One of the Greek terms for obedience conveys the idea of positioning oneself under someone by submitting to their authority and command. Another Greek word for obey in the New Testament means "to trust."
According to Holman's Illustrated Bible Dictionary a succinct definition of biblical obedience is "to hear God's Word and act accordingly."

Eerdman's Bible Dictionary says, "True 'hearing,' or obedience, involves the physical hearing that inspires the hearer, and a belief or trust that in turn motivates the hearer to act in accordance with the speaker's desires."

So, biblical obedience means, simply, to hear, trust, submit and surrender to God and obey his Word.</p>
<h3>
Jesus Calls Us to Obedience
</h3>
<p>
In Jesus Christ we find the perfect model of obedience. As his disciples, we follow Christ's example as well as his commands. Our motivation for obedience is love:
John 14:15
If you love me, you will keep my commandments. (ESV)</p>
<h3>
Obedience is an Act of Worship
</h3>
<p>
While the Bible places strong emphasis on obedience, it's important to remember that believers are not justified (made righteous) by our obedience. Salvation is a free gift of God, and we can do nothing to merit it.
True Christian obedience flows from a heart of gratitude for the grace we have received from the Lord.</p>
<h2>
Patience
</h2>
<p>
When everything is going our way, patience is easy to demonstrate. The true test of patience comes when our rights are violated—when another car cuts us off in traffic; when we are treated unfairly; when our co worker derides our faith, again. Some people think they have a right to get upset in the face of irritations and trials. Impatience seems like a holy anger. The Bible, however, praises patience as a fruit of the Spirit (Gal 5:22) which should be produced for all followers of Christ (1 Thess 5:14). Patience reveals our faith in God’s timing, omnipotence, and love.</p>
<p>
Although most people consider patience to be a passive waiting or gentle tolerance, most of the Greek words translated “patience” in the New Testament are active, robust words. Consider, for example, <dr class="alt5">“Therefore since we also are surrounded with so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight and the sin which so easily besets us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us” (Heb 12:1)</dr class="alt5">. Does one run a race by passively waiting for slow-pokes or gently tolerating cheaters? Certainly not! The word translated “patience” in this verse means “endurance.” A Christian runs the race patiently by persevering through difficulties. In the Bible, patience is persevering towards a goal, enduring trials, or expectantly waiting for a promise to be fulfilled.</p>
<p>
Patience does not develop overnight. God’s power and goodness are crucial to the development of patience. Colossians 1:11 tells us that we are strengthened by Him to “great endurance and patience,” while James 1:3-4 encourages us to know that trials are His way of perfecting our patience. Our patience is further developed and strengthened by resting in God’s perfect will and timing, even in the face of evil men who “succeed in their ways, when they carry out their wicked schemes” (Psa 37:7). Our patience is rewarded in the end “because the Lord's coming is near” (James 5:7-8). “The Lord is good to those whose hope is in him, to the one who seeks him” (Lam 3:25).</p>
<p>
We see in the Bible many examples of those whose patience characterised their walk with God. James points us to the prophets “as an example of patience in the face of suffering” (James 5:10). He also refers to Job, whose perseverance was rewarded by what the “Lord finally brought about” (James 5:11). Abraham, too, waited patiently and “received what was promised” (Heb 6:15). Jesus is our model in all things, and He demonstrated patient endurance: “Who for the joy set before him endured the cross, scorning its shame, and sat down at the right hand of the throne of God” (Heb 12:2).</p>
<p>
How do we display the patience that is characteristic of Christ? First, we thank God. A person’s first reaction is usually “Why me?”, but the Bible says to rejoice in God’s will (Phil 4:4; 1 Peter 1:6). Second, we seek His purposes. Sometimes God puts us in difficult situations so that we can be a witness. Other times, He might allow a trial for sanctification of character. Remembering that His purpose is for our growth and His glory will help us in the trial. Third, we remember His promises such as Romans 8:28, which tells us that “all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to his purpose.” The “all things” include the things that try our patience.</p>
<p>
The next time you are in a traffic jam, betrayed by a friend, or mocked for your testimony, how will you respond? The natural response is impatience which leads to stress, anger, and frustration. Praise God that, as Christians, we are no longer in bondage to a “natural response” because we are new creations in Christ Himself (2 Cor 5:17). Instead, we have the Lord’s strength to respond with patience and in complete trust in the Father’s power and purpose. “To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honour and immortality, he will give eternal life” (Rom 2:7).</p>
<h2>
Sensitivity towards God
<h2>
<h3>
David’s Sensitivity
</h3>
<p>
David was a man who had this special sensitivity towards God. Many times before or during a battle, he would ask God what to do.
When the Philistines heard that David was anointed king over Israel, they wanted to seek him and most likely take his life. Faced with this threat, David did not gather all his wise men together for advice or to strategise their defence.
Instead, he looked to God for advice:
David inquired of the Lord, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will You deliver them into my hand?” And the Lord said to David, “Go up, for I will doubtless deliver the Philistines into your hand.” (2 Sam 5:19)
Faithfully, David asked God an important question and he was spiritually sensitive enough to hear God’s answer. Not only did God listen and answer him, David also listened and followed God’s instructions.</p>
<p>
When we ask someone for advice, what we are really telling them is that their thoughts are worth a great deal to us. Every time David asked God for His will, it showed how much he valued God’s thoughts and feelings. It is no wonder that David was called a man after God’s heart.</p>
<h3>
Keeping Pure
</h3>
<p>
How was David able to remain so sensitive towards God all those years? With his own words, he writes of his constant desire to be found clean before God.
Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow ... Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me. (Ps 51:7, 10)
Our God-given conscience tells us what is right or wrong, good or evil, and through the Holy Spirit, we are constantly reminded to examine our thoughts, speech, and actions.
Nevertheless, it is not so easy to keep pure, especially in the college years. Temptations and sins pile up quickly, like bricks laid on top of each other until a wall of separation divides us from recognising the Spirit’s counsel.</p>
<h3>
Meditating on God’s Word
</h3>
<p>
David was always meditating upon the words of God (Ps 19:14). He didn’t do this out of habit or because he has to; he paid great attention to God’s teachings because he loved God very much.
When we love someone they are constantly on our minds. Just the same, if we love God, He will constantly be on our minds. Jesus once told us that where our treasure is, there our hearts will be also (Mt 6:21).
If we keep the words of the Bible and read them everyday, then God will be in our thoughts and our heart. For me, I’ve learned to set aside time just to meditate on God’s words.</p>
<p>
There are a few things that I do to remind myself of God. I read the Bible at the end of my day so that I can fall asleep thinking about God, dream about God, and wake up thinking about Him.
I also have Christian decorations in my room to surround myself with things that remind me of God. I listen to hymns to inspire me, and I attend fellowships to listen to others share their life lessons from God.</p>
<h3>
Spiritual Insensitivity
</h3>
<p>
Being spiritually sensitive means that we are always on the alert and we are aware of Satan’s trap to ensnare us.
It is usually when we fall into spiritual ennui that we begin to lax in our efforts to draw nearer to God. The problem is, Satan usually recognises these crucial weak moments in our lives much faster than we can recognize it for ourselves.
Otherwise, he wouldn’t be called the prowling lion ready in waiting. So we need to “Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil walks about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour” (1 Pet 5:8).
It was in this exact moment of spiritual carelessness that Satan caught David in his weakness for Bathsheba. In fact, David was so weak that he did not even recognise his own sin until it was pointed out to him (2 Sam 12:7-12).
Usually, people don’t normally recognise that they are taking the wrong turn. By the time we realise that we have, that’s because we’re already knee-deep in spiritual trouble.
To make sure we are able to avoid things that dampen our spiritual sensitivity, we have to be careful not to be lazy and fall into spiritual ennui, where worship and spiritual cultivation becomes merely a habit.
Without being alert, our good habits can turn into a mechanical routine. We should stay alert by keeping a few questions in mind:
When and why did I start reading the Bible and praying daily?
What experience from God moved me to do so?
Do I still feel that same burning feeling in my heart when I read the Bible?
Am I understanding and practising the spiritual teachings I learn
What am I really praying for?
Do I still feel God’s joy, peace, and love, like the first time I experienced it so deeply?
Is the power of the Holy Spirit working mightily through me?
So what happens when your conscience feels clear, and in meditation you can’t find anything else to repent for, since you’ve avoided all that you could to stay spiritually sensitive?
Recently, I’ve been wondering the same thing. The answer came to me while I was reading Paul’s letter to the Corinthian Church. He said, “My conscience is clear, but that does not make me innocent. It is the Lord who judges me” (1 Cor 4:4).
It’s true that it is God that judges us for our sins, even those that are deeply hidden in our hearts. Since only He knows us better than we know ourselves, we need to go to Him in humility to reveal to us sins that we have forgotten and those we did not know.</p>
<p>
We need to pray.</p>
