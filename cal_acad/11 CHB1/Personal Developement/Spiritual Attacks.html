 <h1>
Spiritual Attacks
</h1>
<p>
Christians are fighting a daily battle.  Not against flesh and blood, but against the powers of darkness.  Believers do battle with fallen angels called demons, lead by the chief enemy of God, Satan. <br> These enemies of God and of ours attack believers on a consistent basis.  What can Christians do to arm themselves against these spiritual attacks?  How can a believer fight off theses spiritual attacks?  God has provided a way.  It is found in the Word of God  – the Bible – and it is there that we can “armour up”, so to speak, against the Prince of the Power of the Air (Satan).</p>
<h3>
Putting on the armour of God
</h3>
<p>
The best defence against temptation is a good offence and the offensive weapon is the Sword of the Spirit (the Bible).
We are told that we must put on the armour of God to be able to defend ourselves against the schemes of the Devil (Eph 6:9). <br> Paul, having been under arrest so often by the Roman authorities, was highly familiar with the Roman Soldier’s apparel.  He thought it was the perfect analogy for the Christian in their fight against the invisible enemy of darkness.  The Bible describes just what the armour of God is in Eph 6:10-17.
<h3>
The Belt of Truth
</h3>
<p>
The Belt of Truth is the belt that fastens up the believer in the only truth there is in this world.  <dr class="alt5">Jesus said ..., “I am the way, the truth, and the life (John 14:6)</dr class="alt5">.  There is no other truth that is more absolute than the Word of God (the Bible). <br> We can put it this way: <dr class="alt5">And the Word (Jesus) became flesh and dwelt among us (John 1:1,14)</dr class="alt5">.  The truth is something that we can stand firm on knowing that God can not lie and has promised to deliver us and not one of us will be lost (John 6:37, 10:28-29). <br> We can stand firm if we are in Christ (2 Cor 1:21).  Paul says<dr class="alt5"> "Stand therefore, having girded your waist with truth” (Eph 6:14)</dr class="alt5">. <br> The Roman soldier had a belt and when he prepared for battle, he girded up his loins with his belt. That is he pulled up his long garment and tucked it in so that he could more easily do battle with the enemy, not trip over his clothing, and not be encumbered by his accessories.  This enabled him to stand firm and hold his ground to fight. <br> The truth will not only set you free, but it allows you to be on guard, to be courageous, and to be strong (I Cor 16:13). <br> The world can not buckle this belt because they do not have the truth.
<h3>
The Breastplate of Righteousness
</h3>
<p>
The Breastplate of Righteousness is the righteousness that comes from our faith in Christ.  It is truly the righteousness of Christ that has been imputed to us on account of His righteousness.<br>  If we had our righteousness to protect us we would be in great danger.  Fortunately, Jesus Christ’s righteousness is imputed to those who trust in Him;<dr class="alt5"> “By that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.“ (Heb 10:10,14)</dr class="alt5"> <br>The world does not have this and so they have no defence against wicked spirits. <br> When we are born-again, the literal translation means “born from above.”  <br>The meaning is clear; we are born of God by the Holy Spirit to be a possession of His forever.  We are only given this grace by the placing of our sins on Christ Himself and we are accounted righteous before God because of the perfect sacrifice of the Lamb of God.  The wrath of God has been removed and when we stand before God He will declare us “not guilty” because our Advocate has paid for our sins with His own life. <br>Those who are not saved do not have this breastplate to protect themselves on the day of judgement; the Great White Throne Judgement that is coming for those who do not believe in Jesus (Rev 20).</p>
<h3>
The Sandals of Peace
</h3>
<p>
The so-called Sandals of Peace is the readiness and inner-peace that comes from knowing that<dr class="alt5"> “He Himself is our peace” (Eph 2:14-15)</dr class="alt5">.  It is called the “gospel of peace” for this reason.<br>  Christians are at peace with God because <dr class="alt5">“having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,(Rom 5:1)</dr class="alt5">. <br> Before we were saved we were enemies of God as Paul attests to in Rom 5, <dr class="alt5">“For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life!” (Rom 5:10)</dr class="alt5"> <br>John 14 shows us this peace that comes from Christ, <dr class="alt5">“Peace I leave with you, My peace I give to you; not as the world gives do I give to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.“ (John 14:27)</dr class="alt5"> <br>The world can not have this peace as it says in John 16, <dr class="alt5">“These things I have spoken to you, that in Me you may have peace. In the world you will have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.” (John 16:33)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
The Shield of Faith
</h3>
<p>
The Shield of Faith is a must <dr class="alt5">to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked one (the Devil) (Eph 6:16)</dr class="alt5">. <br> Shields in the First century were a combination of cloth and wood. <br> These shields were then soaked in oil.  This oil was not a flammable oil but an oil that would quench the flaming arrows that were frequently used during battles and this oil could easily represent the Holy Spirit.<br>  The shield of faith is the faith that is placed in Jesus Christ.  There is no greater faith in all the universe. <br> If it were our faith, then this shield could easily be penetrated by doubts and fears, for alone we are no match for the Devil and his fallen angles (demons).  However, when a person places their faith in Christ, this means that they place their full assurance in Christ; they fully rely on, they totally lean upon, and have a complete trust in Christ Himself. <br> Non-believers have only their own faith to protect them.  It is a frail, feeble, untrustworthy faith – a worldly faith.  It is a hope-so faith and not a know-so faith that is only found in Jesus Christ (Gal 2:20). <br> The world’s faith at best can only be in their job, in their bank account, in their stocks or retirement funds.  The faith that believers have in Christ is secure and eternal and no moths, rust, or decay can touch it – it is safe from robbers nor can any stock market crash effect it (Matt 6:19-21).</p>
<h3>
The Helmet of Salvation
</h3>
<p>
The Helmet of Salvation goes over the head.  I believe it is meant to protect the knowledge of the security of our salvation.  This helmet fits over the head and therefore covers the intellect. <br> Not only can the Devil not take our life (Job 1:20) but he can not touch our imperishable crown.<br>  Everything on this earth is perishable but the imperishable crown is protected for eternity as Paul says in 1 Cor 9, <dr class="alt5">“And everyone who competes for the prize is temperate in all things. Now they do it to obtain a perishable crown, but we for an imperishable crown.” (1 Cor 9:25)</dr class="alt5"><br> The knowledge of our salvation should help us endure the afflictions and persecutions of this world.  Paul is encouraging us by writing in 2 Cor 4,<dr class="alt5"> “Therefore we do not lose heart. Even though our outward man is perishing, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, is working for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory, while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are temporary, but the things which are not seen are eternal.” (2 Cor 4:16-18)</dr class="alt5"> <br>Isn’t this a wonderful thing to know?  We are secured for eternity and it is not temporary like that of the world.  It is eternal and makes the temporary troubles seem trivial in comparison (Rom 8:18).</p>
<p>
The Helmet of Salvation (this knowledge) should help a believer when they start having doubts about their own salvation, if they are truly saved or not, or to think that they are not worthy to be saved.  The enemy will use doubts and self-condemnation to attack the believer that does not have this helmet. <br> One way to tell if it is the Holy Spirit convicting a believer or the Devil that is condemning them is that the Holy Spirit will not condemn but convict. <br> The Devil will put in thoughts into the believer's mind that they are not worthy, or that they are just pretending to be a Christian but really aren’t one.  That is the enemies tactic and why it is so important to have the Helmet of Salvation adorned.  Those who are not Christ’s own can not wear this helmet since they do not have this knowledge.</p>
<h3>
The Sword of the Spirit
</h3>
<p>
The Sword of the Spirit is the only offensive weapon that the Christian has at their disposal to fight off the enemy. <br> Jesus used the Word of God (Scripture) to resist and fight off the Devil in the Temptation in the Wilderness. <br> In Luke 4, Jesus is tempted by the Devil. <dr class="alt5">“The devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, command this stone to become bread.”  Jesus answered, “It is written: Man shall not live by bread alone , but by every word of God.” <br>Then the devil, taking Him up on a high mountain, showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time. And the devil said to Him, <br>“All this authority I will give You, and their glory; for this has been delivered to me, and I give it to whomever I wish. Therefore, if You will worship before me, all will be Yours.” And Jesus answered and said to him, “Get behind Me, Satan! For it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only you shall serve.” Then he brought Him to Jerusalem, set Him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, “If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down from here. For it is written: He shall give His angels charge over you,
To keep you, and, in their hands they shall bear you up, lest you dash your foot against a stone” And Jesus answered and said to him, “It has been said, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.” (Luke 4:3-12)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Three times the Devil tried to tempt Jesus and each time Jesus used the Word of God.  The best defence against temptation is a good offence and the offensive weapon is the Sword of the Spirit (the Word of God – the Bible).  Putting it this way, if you get into the Word of God, the Word of God will get into you.  I heard a pastor once say, “Show me a worn out Bible and I’ll show you a strong Christian.” <br> David knew the value of hiding the Word of God in his heart.  It helped him endure for so many years running for his life from King Saul.  <br>The Devil knows the truth but he hates it.  When you feel temptations coming on or feel spiritual attacks hitting you, then reading or praying back Scripture is the most effective weapon there is.  The Word of God is the very power of God Himself. It is alive, active, and powerful.  The unsaved do not have this at their disposal.</p>
<h3>
Satan’s Ministers
</h3>
<p>
Satan actually has ministers and many of them are behind the pulpits.<br>  Even the Devil can appear as an angel of light.  Paul says <dr class="alt5">“For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ. And no wonder, for Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light.<br> (2 Cor 11:13-14)</dr class="alt5"> <br> It is not surprising, then, if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness. <br>Paul said <dr class="alt5">“But I fear, lest somehow, as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ. For if he who comes preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached, or if you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or a different gospel which you have not accepted—you may well put up with it!” <br>(2 Cor. 11:3-4)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
Any church that does not preach about the divinity of Christ, that He came in the flesh, was born of a virgin, lived a perfect life, and shed His blood to redeem fallen humans on the cross of Calvary is a false gospel and is not from God ( I John 2:22-23, 2 John 1:7-11).</p>
<h3>
Satan’s Prime Targets
</h3>
<p>
Satan does not concern himself with the world.  He is not interested in them because they are already headed down the broad path of destruction.<br>  Those who do not believe in Christ do not need persuasion to sin.  They are already held captive by the god of this world (2 Cor 4:4). <br> He also may not waste much time attacking so called carnal Christians.<br> Those believers who live in a way that is not growing in grace, in holiness, and in the knowledge of the Lord God are no threat to the Devil. <br> No, those who Satan sees as his arch enemies are those who are trying to live a holy life.  He particularly hates those who are sharing the gospel of Jesus Christ.  Even though he has already been defeated, he focuses his energy and sends his demons against those who are actively proclaiming Jesus Christ as the one and only way to heaven.</p>
<p>
Spiritual attacks seem to most frequently occur at times of personal growth in the believer, when a Christian is overcoming a major sin or addiction, and when they are sharing their faith in Jesus Christ with others. <br> We give far too much credit to the Devil.  Remember that he was a created being and can never be God’s equal.  Neither is he omnipresent; that is he can not be in different places at the same time.  He is not omniscient either so he can not know your heart or mind like God can.  He has been defeated by Jesus Christ and Satan can do only what God allows or permits him to do and not one bit more.  He is within God’s sovereignty in everything he does (Job 1).</p>
<p>
I believe that spiritual attacks may be on the increase.  Christians feel that the way this world is going that they may be living in the last days before Jesus Christ returns.   Although no one knows the day nor the hour of His return, we can clearly see the signs (Matt 24). <br> Satan must also realise that his time is running out before Jesus Christ returns to bind him and toss him into the Lake of Fire (Rev 20:10). <br> If you are not a believer in Jesus Christ, your fate will be sealed on the day of His return (Rev. 20:12).  Today it is still not too late to come to saving faith in Jesus Christ (2 Cor 6:2). <br> If you are not a believer in Him, then you will have the same ending as the Devil himself – but for those who have been saved by grace through faith, they have already won the victory over sin, over death,  and over the Devil.  There’s victory in Jesus, but only death -eternal death – by rejecting Him. <br> I pray you will join the other victors to live for eternity with God in the joy of fellowship and relationship.  It will be the end of death, sorrow, pain, and suffering, but just the beginning of an everlasting joy that can not even be described (Rom 8:18).
