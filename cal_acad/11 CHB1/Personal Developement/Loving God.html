   <h1>
Loving God
</h1>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">Then one of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him, and saying, “Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?” Jesus said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the first and great commandment." (Matt 22:35-38).</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
How do you go about showing your love to God?<br> A friend of mine said, "We could try giving presents to God, but the delivery problems are immense!"</p>
<h3>
What better gift can you give? 
</h3>
<p>
Maybe the best way is by seeking to be like Him. That's the greatest compliment.<br>
Things like loving your neighbour without regard for his or her "lovableness"; showing compassion for those who suffer, or for those who are small and can't defend themselves.
Intimacy with God occurs not so much in worship at church, but in transformed character that can endure silence and solitude as well as do ordinary tasks in an extraordinary way for ordinary people.<br> By a person like you, who is willing to let God have His way in your life in all the little things.<br>
<p style="text-align:center"> <font color="firebrick">What better gift can you give to God than yourself? </font></p>
