Spiritual need for Cleansing

<h2>
Hardness of Heart
</h2>
<p>
“For they had not understood about the loaves, because their heart was hardened.” (Mark 6:52)</p>
<p>
The word understand means “to study, ponder, deliberate, examine, or think upon.” The scriptural term that would relate to “understand” would be the word “meditate.” Or we could substitute the word “focus” for “understand.” So the disciple's hearts were hard, since they didn’t “focus” on the miracle of Jesus feeding the 5,000.</p>
<p>
It wasn’t sin that caused the disciple's hearts to be hard—it was their focus on things other than the miracle Jesus had just performed. They were occupied with trying to save their lives in the midst of the storm. That wasn’t sin.</p>
<p>
This is what was wrong with the disciples. They had just witnessed Jesus taking five small loaves of bread and two small fish, and feeding an entire multitude of at least 15,000 people. What an awesome miracle! If they had kept their minds stayed on that miracle, they wouldn’t have been shocked or surprised to see Jesus walking on the water.
And notice that Mark 6:45 makes special mention of the fact that Jesus “made” His disciples to get into the boat and go to the other side. That means He had to compel them. They didn’t want to go, but Jesus made them do it. Therefore, they didn’t get into this situation because of some mistake on their part; they were under direct orders from the Master. That means Jesus was responsible for what happened to them.</p>
<p>
If they had been thinking spiritually instead of naturally, they would have known that Jesus would take care of them. Instead of being surprised to see Jesus walking on the water, they would have expected it.</p>
<p>
Likewise, if we were not so dominated by considering the natural, we would not be surprised by the supernatural. We should expect to see the miraculous power of God manifest in our lives all the time. But the truth is, our hearts have become hardened toward God and His supernatural power because of our failure to stay focused on spiritual things.</p>
<p>
One of the benefits of understanding what causes hard heartedness is that you can reverse this process and use it to become hardened against the devil. That is absolutely true. You have the power to determine what your heart accepts or rejects.

For example, you cannot be tempted with something you cannot think. You won’t act in a way that you haven’t already considered in your mind. So, control your thoughts and you’ll control your actions. That’s simple but profound. Most people don’t operate that way.</p>
<p>
One of the ways to soften your heart toward God is to just sit and soak in the truth. It’s not enough just to hear truth; you need to absorb it.</p>
 
<h2>
Selfishness
</h2>
<p>
Selfishness is putting your goals, priorities and needs first before everyone else even those who are really in need.

Buy what makes people selfish?
Why do some people give away everything that others need while some never do it?
Is selfishness the result of self love?</p>
<h3>
The truth about selfishness</h3>
<p>
Selfishness is sign of weakness, the selfish person fears to give some of his time, money or effort to others because he is afraid of the consequences that might happen on making such a sacrifice.</p>
<p>
The person who is always busy and who never gives few minutes of his time to God or the the people in need is actually afraid of wasting his time because of believing that he has no control over his life. When that person gives away some of his time he feels insecure because of not being sure whether he will succeed in completing his own tasks or not.

If that person didn’t fear to lose control of his life or if he was confident enough to believe that giving five minutes away won’t hurt his progress then he wouldn’t have been selfish.</p>
<h3>
Selfishness and unmet goals
</h3>
<p>
All of us have dreams and goals but some of us believe that they might not be able to reach them and that’s why they save all of their resources to themselves just to ease some of the insecurity they are feeling.

Lots of selfish people have big unmet needs which make them feel insecure and the result is being afraid to give anything away not to remind themselves of their lack of control over their lives.</p>
<h3>
How to get over selfishness
</h3>
<p>
1) Understand that in most cases selfishness is weakness.
2) Learn how to feel confident about your plans, goals, dreams and meeting your needs so that you can give without feeling afraid.
3) Build more self confidence in dealing with your own life problems so that you get rid of the fear of loss of control</p>

<h1>
Inferiority
</h1>
<p>
 Losers speak words of defeat. Words of death and not of life. Grumbling and complaining words pour out of their mouths like poison. On the other hand, ever been around a winner? Their words are edifying and are encouraging to themselves and all those around them.

Jesus is our example of how to walk and talk victoriously. People flocked to Him like bees to honey. Let His loving, positive thinking and positive speaking life be your pattern for daily living, bearing good fruit in word and action.</p>
<p>
"Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it will eat its fruit" (Prov 18:21).

"He who guards his mouth preserves his life, but he who opens wide his lips shall have destruction." (Prov 13:3)</p>
<p>
I also learned we paint and create pictures on the inside of us with our words. A person that speaks negatively can paint and create a negative and defeated image on the inside of them. A person that speaks positive words (God's promises) will create a winning image on the inside of them.</p>
<p>
He showed me we are to keep a watch over our mouth and mind. To only say and think things in line with His will, His Word. For God hates grumbling and complaining. It opens the door for the enemy to attack you spiritually, soulfully or physically.

"Set a guard, O Lord, over my mouth; keep watch over the door of my lips" (Psa 141:3).</p>
<p>
I want to remind you who you are in Christ. Let these glorious attributes saturate your mind as you daily think and ponder them. In Christ you are:

Victorious, an overcomer, triumphant, more than a conqueror, a child of God, an heir of God, holy, His workmanship, a new creation, a king, a priest, the temple of the holy spirit, the light of the world, an ambassador for Christ, beloved of God, blessed, healed, saved, redeemed (set free by His ransom), a living stone, protected, filled with God's love and faith, you have the wisdom of God, you have the mind of Christ, called to walk in glory, virtue and His perfect will, complete in Christ, prosperous, have all power, riches, strength, honor, your steps are ordered by the Lord and you can hear His voice.</p>
<p>
That's a mouthful, but it is all true because God cannot lie. It is up to you to believe it.
Tear down those strongholds with God's Word. Begin to daily boldly speak and declare who you are in Christ even if your mind argues with you and says it isn't true. Tell your mind to shut up in Jesus' name and get in line with God's Word. Refuse to think and speak words of poverty, lack and defeat. Let God's promises become more real to you than your circumstances. You are what God says you are. You are destined by God to win in this life!

"If God be for us, who can be against us" (Romans 8:3).</p>
<p>
I hope this message of hope will encourage you to keep a watch over your mind and mouth, to only think and say things in line with God's Word, which is His will for your life. As you memorise, meditate and assimilate God's promises of who you are in Christ and what your inheritance is in Christ, then you will be building the image within you that is destined to win, prosper and advance God's Kingdom on earth as you daily submit to His will.</p>
