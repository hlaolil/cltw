Life's Goals
</h1>
<p>
Because goals are the "map” that will guide you toward your God-given purpose, without setting them you will wander in circles without getting where you need to go.</p>
<h3>
Setting goals is not unspiritual.
</h3>
<p>
Many people wrongly think, "Goal setting is unspiritual because it shows a lack of trust. It's not right to plan. Instead, people should wait for God to lead them.”
Granted, God doesn't want us to forge ahead in pride without consulting Him for direction. But neither does He want us to sit around without acting, because He's given us gifts and talents and has also said that we are called to do good works (Eph. 2: 8-10, Rom 12:4-8, Matt 25:14-30).</p>
<p>
Forging ahead without seeking God or sitting back and doing nothing can stem from fear or a lack of faith. However, setting goals and consulting with Him shows that you trust Him and believe that He is able to lead you while you are moving forward.
The revelation of God's will is limited and progressive — your goals may change.</p>
<p>
In years past, I wished God would give me more details about what He wanted me to do. I was certain that more knowledge would guarantee that I wouldn't ruin my life by stepping out of His will.</p>
<p>
Sadly, many people are like I was. They assume that God needs to give them the entire picture of how their purpose will play out before they set goals. Because they are afraid and don't trust that God is in control of their future and purpose, they demand to hear from Him in detail. <br>"You will become a doctor. You will go to University where you will study brain surgery. After that, you will move to a famous hospital, where you will immediately become a part of the staff. You'll stay there your entire career until you retire.”</p>
<p>
Granted, God can do anything, but my personal experience and the experiences of biblical saints reveals that God doesn't give all the details at once while we are fulfilling our purpose.<br> Instead, He often provides just enough information to help us move forward one step at a time. This helps our faith grow. This does not mean we shouldn't set goals. Instead, it means we need to trust Him to lead us into the unknown, and that we may need to re-evaluate and change our goals as He gives us more information. This is OK. It's part of having a dynamic, collaborative and exciting relationship with Him.<br> Can you imagine if we had the future all figured out? Life would not be as exciting.</p>
<p>
As you progress in your purpose and God reveals more information to you, keep a dialogue open with Him, pay attention to the road signs He provides along the way and listen to Him speak to you through His Word and the Holy Spirit. Then you can be confident that He will show you when you are in—and out—of His will.</p>
<p>
Set goals in the context of the total person that God has made you to be.
There are many ways to approach goal setting. Some people look at the big picture, then break goals down into smaller chunks, and some like to take a looser approach. However, no matter how you set goals, it's important to consider the total how God made you in the process.</p>
<p>
God created you (and every person on planet Earth) with several parts. Like a pie with separate pieces, each part is critical to who you are; and all of these parts must be considered when you set goals.<br>
The five parts of a person include:
<p>
Spiritual</p>
<p>
Family</p>
<p>
Social</p>
<p>
Physical</p>
<p>
Work</p>
<p>
If you fail to give each part the proper attention and care as you reach toward your God-given purpose, you'll experience problems.</p>
<p>
For example, because God created you as a spiritual being, He wants you to love Him with your whole heart, soul and mind (Matt 22: 37-40). This means that your goals must agree with your spiritual convictions. If you set goals that go against what you know God asks of you, you will become fragmented emotionally and intellectually and you will lose your joy and enthusiasm.</p>
<p>
Additionally, because God also created you to need connection with others, if you neglect the social aspect of your life and become "all work and no play” you will become out of balance and you'll most likely experience physical, emotional, social and spiritual troubles.</p>
<p>
There's no doubt that God wants you to fulfil your purpose. In fact, it's your duty since He has given you gifts to do so. However, be mindful not to neglect any of the five areas that make up you who you are while you do His work.</p>
<p>
Finally, remember that the world does not rest on your shoulders. You will make mistakes in setting goals. It's OK. Because God wants to see you do His will, He will teach you the way to go as you walk in faith (Psa 32:8).</p>
