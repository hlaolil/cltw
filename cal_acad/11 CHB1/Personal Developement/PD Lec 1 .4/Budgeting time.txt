The preparations of the heart belong to man, but the answer of the tongue is from the Lord. All the ways of a man are pure in his own eyes, but the Lord weighs the spirits. Commit your works to the Lord, and your thoughts will be established. (Prov 16:1-3 )</dr class="alt5"></p>

As a consummate planner, you rely heavily on schedules and ongoing lists to keep things in order. You embrace the plan and adhere strictly to it. Spontaneity and randomness is not your thing. You struggle somewhat with keeping up with the clock but strive to maintain a timely agenda in your uttermost weakness. I just heard someone say, “Amen!” </p>
<p>
The Word of God tells us that it is human nature to make our own plans. After all human beings are created in the Image of God who is the Ultimate Planner. Just taking a glimpse in the design and complexity of the physical composition of a person indicates flawless creation of the Creator even down to the basic cell. Yet God in His Quest for the honest devotion and pure love of His People gave us a will to choose which way we would go and who we would follow.</p>

Unfortunately, many have wondered from God’s Plan and Purpose finding it restrictive and overbearing in the flesh. Of course, we do! Sin has overridden the heart and mind of mankind limiting one’s perspective to the here and now ignoring the day of decision that will precipitate the entirety of forever concerning our soul. After all isn’t that what grace is all about, people’s inability to adhere to God’s Plan and accept His Purpose for our life? Not exactly… Grace and mercy allow us to continue this journey called life in the consummate hope of our Creator and Father that we will return home and claim our inheritance as Children of God. If we will just commit every action of our life beginning with the motives of heart to the Lord, every one of our plans will succeed!</p>

A man’s heart plans his way, but the Lord directs his steps (Prov 16:9)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
What is the point of making plans if the Lord is determining our steps? The Word of God becomes relevant in our life when we take it, break it open, partake of it, and fully digest it. After all, it is the Bread of Life. God’s Plan and Purpose is revealed in His Word. So, back to my question, “What is the point of making plans if the Lord has predetermined one’s steps?” Life is in fact predetermined. God has already determined the course of our life. Everyone will agree that we all are born dying and will one day succumb to natural death as our body releases our spirit. The time this occurs is decided by the Lord before we take in our first breath. The Creator has shaped and molded our life before we were planted in our mother’s womb. And here is what His Word says about that:</p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
1) “For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope. Then you will call upon Me and go and pray to Me, and I will listen to you. And you will seek Me and find Me, when you search for Me with all your heart. I will be found by you, says the Lord.” (Jer 29:11-14)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
2)“Your eyes saw my substance, being yet unformed. and in Your book they all were written, the days fashioned for me, when as yet there were none of them. How precious also are Your thoughts to me, O God! How great is the sum of them!” (Psa 139:16-17)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
3)“And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose. 29 For whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the firstborn among many brethren. 30 Moreover whom He predestined, these He also called; whom He called, these He also justified; and whom He justified, these He also glorified.” (Rom 8:28-30)</dr class="alt5">
<p>
God created you with a plan which means that you have a purpose. He also gave you a free will to decide between life and death or blessing and cursing. 
<dr class="alt5">“I call heaven and earth as witnesses today against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore choose life, that both you and your descendants may live! (Deut 30:19)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
You can make this choice by loving the LORD your God, obeying him, and committing yourself firmly to him. This is the key to your life.
