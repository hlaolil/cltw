The Real Worth of Man

<h3>
Our value as God's children
</h3>
<p>
The Bible actually has many passages that tell us what God has to say about our worth and our value in His eyes. Gen 1:26-27 says we are made in His image, the very image of God. Psa 139:13-16 says we are fearfully and wonderfully made, and all the days of our lives were written in God’s book before we were ever born, confirming God’s prior knowledge and plan for our lives. Eph 1:4 says God chose His children before the foundations of the earth were ever formed, and in Eph 1:13-14 we’re told we are God’s own possession, chosen for the praise of His glory, and that we have an inheritance in heaven with Him as His children.</p>
<h3>
The price God paid to make us worthy
</h3>
<p>
But notice the wording in each of the above phrases: “are made,” “are fearfully and wonderfully made,” “were written,” “God chose His children,” “we are God’s own possession,” and “we have an inheritance.” These phrases all have one thing in common: they are things done to us or for us by God. These are not things we have done for ourselves, nor have we earned or deserved them. We are, in fact, merely the recipients of “all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ” (Eph 1:3). Therefore, we can conclude that our worth is not really of the “self” at all; rather, it is worth given to us by God. We are of inestimable value to Him because of the price He paid to make us worthy—the death of His Son on the cross.</p>
<p>
The Bible tells us that “while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us” (Rom 5:8). In fact, we “were dead in trespasses and sins” (Eph 2:1). What worth is there in dead things? None. God imputed to us His own righteousness (2 Cor 5:21) not because we were worthy of it, but because we were unworthy, unlovable, and unable to make ourselves worthy in any way. But—and here’s the miracle—He actually loved us in spite of our condition (John 3:16), and because He did, we now have infinite worth.</p>
<h3>
Seeing ourselves as God sees us
</h3>
<p>
John 1:12 tells us that to those who received Christ and believed in His name, God gave the right to become His children. First John 1:9 tells us that if we confess our sins, He is faithful to forgive our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we focus on how much God loves us and the price He paid to redeem us, we’ll come to see ourselves as God sees us, and that will help us understand just how much we’re really worth as children of the most high God.</p>
<p>
Our self-worth is too often based on what other people tell us about ourselves. The one, true authority on our self-worth is Jesus Christ, and since He gave His own life up for us by dying on a cross, that should tell us just how valuable we really are.</p>
