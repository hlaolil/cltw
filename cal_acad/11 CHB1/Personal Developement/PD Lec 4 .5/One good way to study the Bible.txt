One good way to study the Bible
</h1>
 <p>
The Bible is the inspired, infallible, authoritative, and complete revelation from God to man. It is a book that must be studied by all who are in search of the truth. The study of the Bible should be conducted in an orderly, systematic way, with open mind, and a deep, burning desire to know the truth. Jesus said, <dr class="alt5">
"And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free." (John 8:32)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
There are many good and profitable ways that one might use in studying the Bible. The purpose of your study would certainly have some influence on the most helpful method one would choose for studying the Bible.
As we begin a study of the Bible, it is helpful to get an overall view of it in its entirety. The Bible is like a mountain that must be viewed from all viewpoints and angles before it can be fully appreciated. We must consider the context in which each passage is found. Always keep in mind the theme of the entire Bible- God’s scheme of human redemption. As you read the individual sixty-six books of the Bible, look for the theme or central point of each book. It is helpful to ask the following questions as you read: Who is speaking? To whom is he speaking? And, about whom or what is the passage speaking?</p>
<p>
The following suggestions may be of further help in your study:
Select a good translation (like New King James Version) with print that is easily read.
Read it naturally, that is, read it as you would any other book ancient or modern.
Read it remembering that all truth is harmonious and that God being its author will at last make it plain to you.
Read it with a prayerful heart, with a teachable mind, and a broken and contrite spirit.
Read it with a determination to do what it says. You cannot understand it otherwise.
Read it, not to prove a preconceived idea or to justify some act of yours, but to learn the truth, whatever it may be.
<h3>
Does the Bible really have all the answers?
</h3>
 <p>
The Bible supplies an answer to all our spiritual needs and questions. It is our authority in religion for all matters of faith and practice. The authority is specific with reference to the things God has commanded of us. The authority for religious practices is sometimes generic in nature. In these instances we are given a background command for the thing to be done without any instructions as to how the thing is to be done. In these matters we have options as to "how" to do the thing being commanded. The New Testament is God’s will for this present age. The apostle Peter wrote, <dr class="alt5">"as His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by glory and virtue," (2 Peter 1:3)</dr class="alt5">. 
The apostle Paul wrote of the completeness of the sacred scriptures,:<dr class="alt5"> All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, 17 that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work." (2 Tim 3:16-17)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
Is the Bible the final authority?
</h3>
 <p>
The Bible is God’s complete and final revelation to man. God has spoken to all mankind in these last days through Jesus Christ by means of the New Testament. (Heb 1:1-2)</p>
<p>
The words of Christ as given to us by inspiration through His apostles and prophets give us God’s final message. The New Testament of Jesus Christ will be the standard by which all religious belief and practice will be judged. Jesus said, <dr class="alt5">
"He who rejects Me, and does not receive My words, has that which judges him—the word that I have spoken will judge him in the last day." (John 12:48)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
There were not to be any latter day revelations beyond the apostolic age. The apostle of Christ wrote by inspiration, <dr class="alt5">
"I marvel that you are turning away so soon from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel, which is not another; but there are some who trouble you and want to pervert the gospel of Christ. But even if we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed. As we have said before, so now I say again, if anyone preaches any other gospel to you than what you have received, let him be accursed." (Gal 1:6-9)</dr class="alt5">
