Have you ever tried to follow a leader or worked for a boss who tells you one thing one day and the opposite the next, or tried to be involved with a person who could never make up their mind regarding what they wanted?</p>
<p>
Christian or otherwise, these people can be drive you crazy!

<p>
I have asked people many times in seminars or classes how many have a difficult time making decisions? It always surprises me how many answer in the affirmative.</p>
<p>
Why is making decisions difficult for many? Some are afraid of making a wrong decision. Some simply don't know what they want. For quite a few when they were growing up, somebody else always made their decisions for them. Consequently, they were never taught how to make decisions for themselves or learned how to accept the consequences for the decisions they made.</p>
<p>
However, as adults, it is much wiser to make our own decisions and be wrong rather than allowing others to make them for us. One of the greatest ways we learn to make right decisions is by making wrong decisions! This is not to say that we shouldn’t seek wise counsel prior to making our decisions.</p>
<p>
To put off and end up not making a decision is making a decision by default which is not a creative way to live. Life is a series of decisions that determine the course of our life and future. It pays to learn how to make wise decisions. God has promised to give us wisdom and guidance to help us make wise decisions, but it's up to each of us to make our own decisions.</p>
<p>
Suggested prayer: "Dear God, help me to face and overcome the cause/s of my fear of making decisions, learn to seek Your guidance in everything I do, and in doing so learn how to make wise and responsible decisions. Thank You for hearing and answering my prayer. Gratefully in Jesus’s name, amen." </p>
