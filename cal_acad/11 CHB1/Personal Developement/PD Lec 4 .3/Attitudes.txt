<h1>
Attitudes
</h1>
<p>
Writing from a prison cell in Rome, the apostle Paul wrote about the attitude a Christian should have: <dr class="alt5">“Only let your conduct be worthy of the gospel of Christ,(Phil 1:27)</dr class="alt5">. He’s telling us that no matter what unexpected disruptions, frustrations, or difficulties come our way, we are to respond with a Christ-like attitude. Paul later writes, <dr class="alt5">“Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus,” (Phil 2:5)</dr class="alt5">. He also encourages us to <dr class="alt5">Therefore be imitators of God as dear children.” ( Eph 5:1)</dr class="alt5"> As children love to imitate what they see and repeat what they hear; we also are charged to <dr class="alt5">Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.(Matt 5:16)</dr class="alt5">.
<h3>
Jesus' Attitude
</h3>
<p>
Jesus maintained a perfect attitude in every situation because He prayed about everything and worried about nothing. We, too, should seek God’s guidance about every aspect of our lives and allow Him to work out His perfect will without interference. Jesus’ attitude was never to become defensive, discouraged, or depressed because His goal was to please the Father rather than to achieve His own agenda. In the midst of trials, He was patient. In the midst of suffering, He was hopeful. In the midst of blessing, He was humble. Even <dr class="alt5">who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but committed Himself to Him who judges righteously;” (1 Peter 2:23)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<h3>
Our Attitude
</h3>
<p>
When Paul tells us that our “attitude should be the same as that of Christ Jesus,” he had summarised in the previous two verses what such an attitude was: selflessness, humility, and service. <dr class="alt5">“Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit, but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than himself. Let each of you look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others” (Phil 2:3-4)</dr class="alt5">. In other words, the attitude a Christian should reflect is one that focuses on the needs and interests of others. Without question, that does not come naturally to us. When Christ came into the world, He established a whole new attitude to relationships with others.</p> 
<p>One day when His disciples were arguing among themselves regarding who was to be greatest in His kingdom, Jesus said, <dr class="alt5">“You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who are great exercise authority over them. Yet it shall not be so among you; but whoever desires to become great among you, let him be your servant. And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be your slave— just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many” (Matt 20:25-28)</dr class="alt5">. Jesus is teaching us that, when we become preoccupied with our own things, it can cause conflicts and other problems with people we know. Instead, God wants us to have an attitude of serious, caring involvement in the concerns of others.</p>
<h3>
Christ-like Attitude
</h3>
<p>
Paul speaks more about this Christ-like attitude in his letter to the church in Ephesus: <dr class="alt5">“you have heard Him and have been taught by Him, as the truth is in Jesus: that you put off, concerning your former conduct, the old man which grows corrupt according to the deceitful lusts, and be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and that you put on the new man which was created according to God, in true righteousness and holiness” (Eph 4:21-24)</dr class="alt5">. Many religions of today, including the New Age philosophies, promote the old lie that we are divine or that we can become gods. But the truth of the matter is that we will never become God, or even a god. Satan’s oldest lie was promising Adam and Eve that, if they followed his advice, <dr class="alt5">“you will be like God,” (Gen 3:5)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<h3>
Take on God's values, attitudes, and character
</h3>
<p>
Each time we try to control our circumstances, our future, and the people around us, we’re only demonstrating that we want to be a god. But we must understand that, as creatures, we will never be the Creator. God doesn’t want us to try to become gods. Instead, He wants us to become like Him, taking on His values, His attitudes, and His character. We are meant to <dr class="alt5">“be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and that you put on the new man which was created according to God, in true righteousness and holiness” (Eph 4:23-24)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<h3>
Transforming our minds
</h3>
<p>
Finally, we must always keep in mind that God’s ultimate goal for His children is not our comfort, but the transformation of our minds into the attitude of godliness. He wants us to grow spiritually, to become like Christ. This doesn’t mean losing our personalities or becoming mindless clones. Christ likeness is all about transforming our minds. Again, Paul tells us, <dr class="alt5">“And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God” (Rom 12:2)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
It is God’s will that we develop the kind of mindset described in the Beatitudes of Jesus (Matt 5:1-12), that we exhibit the fruit of the Spirit (Gal 5:22-23), that we emulate the principles in Paul’s great chapter on love (1 Cor 13), and that we strive to pattern our lives after Peter’s characteristics of an effective and productive life (2 Peter 1:5-8).</p>
