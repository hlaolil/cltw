 <h1>
All Scripture Is God-Breathed
</h1>
<p>
An essential doctrine of the Christian faith is the belief that the Bible is the inspired Word of God, or "God-breathed." <br>The Bible itself claims to be written by divine inspiration:
<dr class="alt5"><br>
All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness ... (2 Tim 3:16)</dr class="alt5"><br>
Here we find another verse to support this doctrine:<br>
<dr class="alt5">
"For this reason we also thank God without ceasing, because when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you welcomed it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which also effectively works in you who believe". (1 Thess 2:13)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
But what do we mean when we say the Bible is inspired?
We know the Bible is a compilation of 66 books and letters written by more than 40 authors over a period of approximately 1,500 years in three different languages. <br>How, then, can we claim it is God-breathed?</p>
<h3>
The Scriptures Are Without Error
</h3>
<p>
Leading Bible theologian Ron Rhodes explains in his book, Bite-Size Bible Answers, "God superintended the human authors so that they composed and recorded His revelation without error, but they used their own individual personalities and even their own unique writing styles. In other words, the Holy Spirit permitted the authors to exercise their own personalities and literary talents even though they wrote under His control and guidance. <br>The result is a perfect and errorless recording of the exact message God desired to give to human-kind."</p>
<h3>
Written Under the Holy Spirit's Control
</h3>
<p>
The Scriptures teach us that the Holy Spirit produced the work of preserving the Word of God through the authors of the Bible. God chose men such as Moses, Isaiah, John and Paul to receive and record His words.

These men received God's messages in various ways and used their own words and writing styles to express what the Holy Spirit brought forth. <br>They were aware of their secondary role in this divine and human cooperation:
<dr class="alt5"><br>
... knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of any private interpretation, for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. (2 Peter 1:20-21)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
These things we also speak, not in words which man’s wisdom teaches but which the Holy Spirit teaches, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.<br> (1 Cor 2:13)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
Only the Original Manuscripts Are Inspired
</h3>
<p>
It's important to understand that the doctrine of the inspiration of Scripture applies solely to the original handwritten manuscripts. These documents are called autographs, as they were penned by the actual human authors.</p>
<p>
While Bible translators throughout history have worked painstakingly to maintain accuracy and complete integrity in their interpretations, conservative scholars are careful to assert that only the original autographs are inspired and without error. And only faithfully and correctly interpreted copies and translations of the Bible are considered reliable.</p>
