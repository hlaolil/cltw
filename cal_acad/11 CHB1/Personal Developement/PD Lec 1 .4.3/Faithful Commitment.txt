<h1>
Faithful Commitment
 </h1>
<p>  
Jesus, the messiah of mankind, lived a life in the flesh like no other man.  His words and His actions perfectly fit the pattern prescribed by God the Father (John 5:30, John 12:49-50).  That all men save Jesus fall short of the Glory of God is factual (Rom 3:23).  Yet, many who declare themselves prepared for faithful commitment to God soon find themselves transgressing against their vows to serve him.  Their declaration of service comes before considering the cost – their life (Gal 2:20).  Jesus spoke about this in the parable of the sower.</p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
But he who received the seed on stony places, this is he who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy; yet he has no root in himself, but endures only for a while. For when tribulation or persecution arises because of the word, immediately he stumbles.. (Matt 13:20-21)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
How many souls have walked the path of those words?  Hearts praise God every time a sinner comes to Him and humbly calls upon Him for forgiveness.  The sinner is <dr class="alt5">buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life (Rom 6:4)</dr class="alt5">.   Then, sadly, within a short time he sets aside his vow of faithful commitment and returns to the world.  It is much like an individual who swears off addictions.<br>  
His earnestness appears obvious to all.  Yet, he cannot bear the weight of his choice and returns once again to a lack of self control.</p>
<p>
The path of those who hastily agree to faithful commitment to God is broad.  The people of Israel left Egypt, a first born nation of God.  When Moses shared with them the ordinances of God, “all the people answered with one voice and said, <dr class="alt5">“All the words which the Lord has said we will do.” (Ex 24:3)</dr class="alt5"> <br> Shortly thereafter (forty days and forty nights), when Moses would come down Mt. Sinai with the ten commandments etched in stone by the finger of God, he would find the children of Israel already engaged in sins against Him whom they swore to obey.  Israel was the bride of God and yet, they chose to be unfaithful.  A marriage of 40 days resulting in infidelity demonstrates a lack of dedication to vows.  That sinful body of people save those twenty years old and under as well as Joshua and Caleb would not make it out of the wilderness.  They would spend 40 years meeting their death.</p>
<p>
The feet of the descendants of that people would make it to the Promised Land, Canaan.  After establishing themselves in the land, Joshua would speak to them about their renewed vows to God in Joshua 24</p>
<p>
“You cannot serve the Lord, for He is a holy God. He is a jealous God; He will not forgive your transgressions nor your sins. If you forsake the Lord and serve foreign gods, then He will turn and do you harm and consume you, after He has done you good.” And the people said to Joshua, “No, but we will serve the Lord!” So Joshua said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the Lord for yourselves, to serve Him.” And they said, “We are witnesses!” (Joshua 24:19-22)</p>
<p>
Joshua was critical of their dedication to the Lord.  He warned them of unfaithfulness.  Still they declared they would serve God.  Following the death of Joshua, the people faltered in their obedience to God their Head and Master.  They did not drive the inhabitants of Canaan out of the land.  They became idolatrous.  They turned their back on the One to whom they had been betrothed.  They broke their vows to walk the broad way of their forefathers.  They had truly not committed themselves to the Lord.  God punished them often for their continued disobedience.</p>
<p>
Centuries later, beyond the time of judges and toward the end of the Kings of Israel, the prophet Jeremiah would prophecy of the coming terror of Babylon.  He would tell the people of Judah and Jerusalem that they would be disciplined for their infidelity.  The people called upon Jeremiah to beseech the Lord in prayer for their safety: <dr class="alt5">“Whether it is pleasing or displeasing, we will obey the voice of the Lord our God to whom we send you, that it may be well with us when we obey the voice of the Lord our God” (Jer 42:6)</dr class="alt5">.  The word of God came to Jeremiah telling the people to stand strong in the land which He had given them.  Not to run in fear back to the land of Egypt.  If they would remain, He would turn away Babylon.  Yet, the people did run to Egypt.  They did not obey God, once again going against their own words.  Thus, Babylon destroyed them by the hand of God.</p>
<p>
Those things recorded of Israel serve as a guide to the actions of man today (Rom 15:4).  God is a faithful God (Deut 7:9), but Israel did not put their trust in Him.  They had received Him initially with joy, but they did not have depth to their embracing of Him.  He therefore disciplined them for their lack of faithful commitment.</p>
<p>
Seeing that man has often jumped into the service of God without a deep commitment, soon turning away from Him, what can be done to reduce the occurrence of this?<br>
<font size="+1">First</font>, adequate instruction should be given to those who would come to Christ.  So frequently, the demands of discipleship are not explained thoroughly to the potential Christian.  Individuals readily clothe themselves in Him through baptism, only to realise their hearts were not ready to repent of their worldly lifestyles.  The trials and persecutions which arise immediately overcome the unprepared and weak soul.  Great care must be taken with those who have an infantile knowledge of Christ.  They must be nourished and fed His Word with the understanding of what it means to be a Christian.</p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
And whoever does not bear his cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple. For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not sit down first and count the cost, whether he has enough to finish it— lest, after he has laid the foundation, and is not able to finish, all who see it begin to mock him, saying, ‘This man began to build and was not able to finish? Or what king, going to make war against another king, does not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand? Or else, while the other is still a great way off, he sends a delegation and asks conditions of peace. So likewise, whoever of you does not forsake all that he has cannot be My disciple. (Luke 14:27-33)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Second</font>, those considering Christ must understand the world and its vices are not their friend, but an enemy to be put away with the birth of a new creature (John 3:5, 2 Corinthians 5:17).  So many believe they can still be a part of the world around them and serve Christ in faithful commitment.  Yet, this was the failure of Israel before them.  Israel was not to dwell with the people of the land (Deuteronomy 7:1-3).  They were not to marry with them.  They were not to make covenants with them.  They were to utterly destroy them since their time of disobedience was over (Genesis 15:16).  While God does not call His people to discipline by war as He did in the time of Israel (Vengeance is the Lord’s – Romans 12:19), He does still call upon His people to be separate from the world (Romans 12:1-2, 2 Corinthians 6:14-18).</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Finally</font>, consider Jesus Words in Matt 12
<dr class="alt5">
“When an unclean spirit goes out of a man, he goes through dry places, seeking rest, and finds none. Then he says, I will return to my house from which I came. And when he comes, he finds it empty, swept, and put in order. Then he goes and takes with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter and dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first. So shall it also be with this wicked generation.” (Matt 12:43-45)<dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Not only must those who would come to Christ be truly taught what it means to be a disciple and separate from the world, they must understand the need to fill their lives with the things of God (Phil 4:8).  There is a term often used “Nature abhors a vacuum” carrying the meaning that emptiness will be filled.  The question is what shall fill the life of one coming to Christ?  They may indeed cleanse themselves of sin, but if they do not fill their lives in the service and knowledge of their God through faithful commitment, they will once again fill it in service to the god of the world (2 Tim 2:15, 2 Peter 3:18).</p>
<p>
Take a moment to consider all those who you have seen baptised into Christ.  Whether young or old, how many of them fully understood before their conversion what was expected from discipleship?  Did they separate themselves from the world or did they continue to try and balance the world with their life?  Did they fill themselves with the Words which Jehovah spoke or did they once again live a life stained by the filth of the world?  Christians, be vigilant to remain faithful (I Cor 10:12, 16:13) and take great care with those who espouse themselves to Christ (2 Tim 2:24-26, Jude 1:20-23).</p>
<p>
Our relationship with God is a deep matter in which we should be fully prepared to trust our God and exercise faithful commitment to our vows to Him while training others to observe the same.  While souls will still be lost who did not fully consider the costs of discipleship, by taking the steps discussed, more will be prepared.</p>
