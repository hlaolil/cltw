Rules for a Meaningful Quiet Time
</h1>
<p>
“Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me, and know my anxieties; and see if there is any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting” (Psa 139:23-24)</p>
<p>
Someone has said, “If you aim at nothing, you are sure to hit it!” To have a meaningful quiet time, you will need a plan or some kind of general outline to follow.</p>
<h3>
Keep your plan simple.
</h3>
<p>
You will need the following three items for your planned quiet times:

A Bible — a contemporary translation (not a paraphrase i.e. The Living Bible (TLB) or The New Living Translation (NLT)) with good print, preferably without notes.<br>
A notebook for writing down what the Lord shows you and for making a prayer list.<br>
A hymn book — sometimes you may want to sing in your praise time (see Colossians 3:16).</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Wait on God (relax)<br>
Be still for a minute; don’t come running into God’s presence and start talking immediately. Follow God’s admonition:<font color= "blue"> “Be still and know that I am God” (Psa 46:10; see also Isa 30:15; 40:31)</font>. Be quiet for a short while to put yourself into a reverent mood.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Pray briefly (request)</font><br> 
This is not your prayer time, but a short opening prayer to ask God to cleanse your heart and guide you into the time together. Two good passages of Scripture to memorise are Psa 139:23-24 and Psa 119:18. You need to be in tune with the Author before you can understand his Book!</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Read a section of the Scripture (read)</font><br> 
This is where your conversation with God begins. He speaks to you through his Word, and you speak with him in prayer.</p> 
<h3>
How to read your Bible
</h3>
<p><font size="+1">
Read your Bible Slowly</font><br> 
Don’t be in a hurry; don’t try to read too large an amount; don’t race through it.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Repeatedly</font> <br>
Read a passage over and over until you start to picture it in your mind. The reason more people don’t get more out of their Bible reading is that they do not read the Scriptures repeatedly.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Without stopping</font><br> 
Don’t stop in the middle of a sentence to go off on a tangent and do a doctrinal study. Just read that section for the pure joy of it, allowing God to speak to you.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Aloud but quietly</font><br> 
Reading it aloud will improve your concentration and help you understand what you are reading better because you will both see and hear what you are reading. Read softly enough, however, so that you won’t disturb anyone.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Systematically</font><br>
Do not use the “random dip” method—a passage here, a chapter there, what you like here, an interesting portion there. You’ll understand the Bible better if you read it as it was written—a book or letter at a time.
