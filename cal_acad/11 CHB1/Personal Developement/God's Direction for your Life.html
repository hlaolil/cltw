 <h1>
God's Direction for your Life
</h1>
<p><dr class="alt5">
Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding; In all your ways acknowledge Him, and He shall direct your paths.  (Prov 3:5-6)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Mankind has split the atom, explores space, communicates instantly, and tracks events across the globe as they happen. Yet with all this, we’re in deep trouble. Today as never before, people clamour for direction for their lives. <br>You hear them on radio or TV, or read on line posts to advisers or psychologists. Many who used to call psychic hot lines now contact “life coaches,” talk show hosts—even politicians—hoping for that word of wisdom either to guide them or help them cope.</p>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way of death. (Prov 14:12)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<h3>
Wisdom from His Word
</h3>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path. (Psa 119:105)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Wisdom is not an emotional feeling. Wisdom is sanctified common sense, a judicial use of your mind, guided by the Word of God. As people seek answers in a world gone mad, how can you find God’s way to live your life to the fullest? In the owner’s manual, the Bible.</p> 
<p>
<dr class="alt5">The Lord will guide you continually, and satisfy your soul in drought, and strengthen your bones; You shall be like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose waters do not fail. (Isa 58:11)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
While others rush to and fro, you can open your manual to read, <dr class="alt5">“I will instruct you and teach you in the way you should go; I will guide you with My eye.” (Psa 32:8)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Have you ever been guided just by a glance? Can you recall a time when a parent, spouse, or trusted friend has done that? That look in the person’s eye told you exactly what to do—or not do! Our Father offers this kind of guidance. But it comes only from an intimate relationship with the Guide, formed by time spent with Him.</p>
<h3>
Wisdom Through His Spirit
</h3>
<p>
God’s wisdom comes not only by His Word but through the Holy Spirit, living within you.<br> James 1 says, <dr class="alt5">“If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all liberally and without reproach, and it will be given to him.” (James 1:5) </dr class="alt5"><br>The Holy Spirit will guide you in matters where specific guidance is needed. God will speak to your heart when you’re walking in the Spirit.</p>
<p>
If you are a child of God, you have the Father above you, overseeing all things. You have the Son beside you, directing your steps. You have the Spirit within you, impressing your heart and leading you. <br>God has a plan for your individual life. <dr class="alt5">“For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, says the Lord, thoughts of peace and not of evil, to give you a future and a hope” (Jer 29:11)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
The wisdom you need—God’s wisdom—is revealed in His Word, by His Spirit, and through prayer. Your assignment is to find, follow, and finish the plan. Spend time every day meditating in His Word. You will become <dr class="alt5">“like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that brings forth its fruit in its season, whose leaf also shall not wither; and whatever he does shall prosper” (Psa 1:3)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
As you are guided by the Word of God—God’s objective truth, the Witness of God—the Holy Spirit impressing your heart, and the works of God—His providential opening and closing doors, you will have God’s wisdom for your every need.</p>
