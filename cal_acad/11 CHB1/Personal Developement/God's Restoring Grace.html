God's Restoring Grace
</h1>
<p><dr class="alt5">
“So I will restore to you the years that the swarming locust has eaten, ..." (Joel 2:25)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Yes, those wasted years we regret will be restored to us. God can give us such plentiful grace that we will crowd into the remainder of our days as much of service that will recompense for those obstinate years over which we mourn in humble penitence.</p>
<p>
The locusts of backsliding, worldliness, lukewarmness, are now viewed by us as a terrible plague. If only they had never happened!<br>
The Lord in mercy has now taken them away, and we are eager to serve Him. <br>Blessed be His name that we can raise harvests of spiritual graces so that our former barrenness disappears. Through rich grace we can turn to account our bitter experience and use it to warn others.</p>
<p>
We can become more rooted in humility, childlike dependence, and penitent spirituality through the experience of our former shortcomings. If we are more watchful, zealous, and tender, we will gain by our lamentable losses.<br>
The wasted years, by a miracle of love, can be restored. Does it seem too great a blessing? Let us believe it and live for it, and we may yet realise it. </p>
<p>
Peter, after denying Jesus, was forgiven by Him and became all the more useful a man after his  weakness was cured. <br>Lord, aid us by Your grace.</p>
