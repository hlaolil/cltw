 <h1>
The Power Of The Gospel
</h1>
<p>
The Gospel is the most basic, foundational message of 

the New Testament, yet it’s the most misunderstood. 

Today’s religious system is not preaching the same 

Gospel that Paul did. They mix it with the Law, and 

that isn’t the Gospel at all.</p>
<p>
The book of Romans was written to explain the Gospel so 

that anybody could understand it. Paul, the writer, 

made it so simple that you’d have to have somebody help 

you to misunderstand it. And, unfortunately, we’ve had 

a lot of help!</p>
<h3>
Paul made this statement in Romans 1:16
</h3>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">
For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ: for it is 

the power of God to salvation to every one that 

believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. (Rom 

1:16)</dr class="alt5"><br>
That is a radical statement. This word “gospel” in the 

original Greek is a word that was seldom used at the 

time this was written. Nobody talked this way, because 

the word literally means nearly-too-good-to-be-true 

news. <br>It referred to news that was so awesome, nothing 

really justified using it. Nothing was nearly too good 

to be true.</p>
<p>
But Paul said he was not ashamed of the Gospel. Why? 

(see Rom 1:16)<br> The Gospel is the power of God, and 

that’s talking about grace. Acts 20:24 and Galatians 

1:6 both use the terms “gospel” and “grace” 

interchangeably. It’s saying that when you understand 

the Gospel, or the grace of God, it’ll release the 

power of God into your life. That’s huge!</p>
<h3>
Paul's next statement in Romans 1:17
</h3>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">
For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from 

faith to faith; as it is written, “The just shall live 

by faith.” (Rom 1:17)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Notice that righteousness is not revealed from Law to 

Law, from good deed to good deed—it’s revealed from 

faith to faith. Here’s a good piece of information to 

consider: <br>Sin won’t stop the power of God for salvation 

in your life but trusting in your own good works will. 

That’s what “the righteousness of God is revealed from 

faith to faith” means.<dr class="alt5"> For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, (Eph. 2:8)</dr class="alt5">! God won’t 

withdraw His power because of sin in your life. That’s 

why it’s nearly-too-good-to-be-true news.</p>
<p>
When you talk like this, people with a religious 

mindset immediately say, “Well, what about sin? This 

sounds like you’re just giving people a license to 

sin.” Not so! Last I checked, people were sinning 

without a license! I’m not advocating sin. But, see, 

this is the immediate reaction when you start talking 

about righteousness by faith. They think you need to 

make people aware of their sin and the wrath of 

God.</p>
<h3>
Paul's next statement is in Romans 1:18-19
</h3>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">
For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against 

all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who 

suppress the truth in unrighteousness, because what may 

be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown 

it to them. (Rom 1:18-19)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Notice it says it’s manifest in them, not to them, for 

God has shown it to them. God has put in every single 

person who has ever breathed an intuitive knowledge 

that they are a sinner and that they deserve rejection 

instead of acceptance. You don’t need to tell people 

this; they already know it.</p>
<p>
We aren’t called to convict people of their sin but to 

convince them that the only way they can obtain 

righteousness, or right standing, with God is through 

putting faith in what Jesus did for them, not through 

something they’ve done. </p>
<h3>
The Pharisee and the tax collector
</h3>
<p><dr class="alt5">
Also He spoke this parable to some who trusted in 

themselves that they were righteous, and despised 

others: “Two men went up to the temple to pray, one 

a Pharisee and the other a tax collector. The Pharisee 

stood and prayed thus with himself, "God, I thank You 

that I am not like other men—extortioners, unjust, 

adulterers, or even as this tax collector. I fast twice 

a week; I give tithes of all that I possess". and the 

tax collector, standing afar off, would not so much as 

raise his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, 

"God, be merciful to me a sinner!" I tell you, this man 

went down to his house justified rather than the other; 

for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he 

who humbles himself will be exalted.” (Luke 18:9-14)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
This is a powerful parable. Let me ask you: <br>Are you 

like the Pharisee or the tax collector? I’m not talking 

about your actions but your trust. Do you trust in what 

you do for the Lord or what He has done for you? If a 

person is putting faith in all of their religious acts

—all of their holiness—then that will actually block 

them from righteousness and relationship with God. But 

the person who maybe hasn’t been as good, yet they’ve 

humbled themselves and cried out to God, this is the 

one who enters into right standing with God.</p>
<h3>
Righteousness
</h3>
<p>
What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not 

pursue righteousness, have attained to righteousness, 

even the righteousness of faith; but Israel, pursuing 

the law of righteousness, has not attained to the law 

of righteousness. Why? Because they did not seek it by 

faith, but as it were, by the works of the law. (Rom 

9:30-32)</p>
<p>
This says there are two types of righteousness: <br>(1) a faith 

righteousness and <br>(2) a righteousness that comes by the 

Law. <br>Righteousness by the Law is a righteousness based 

on performance.<br> Another way to say it is “self-

righteousness.” The truth is, nobody can perform well 

enough to get Law righteousness, because the Bible says 

that <dr class="alt5">“all our righteousnesses are as 

filthy rags.” (Isa 64:6)</dr class="alt5"> And <dr 

class="alt5">For whoever shall keep the whole law, and 

yet stumble in one point, he is guilty of all. <br>(James 

2:10).</dr class="alt5"> <br>In other words, if you did 

ninety-nine out of a hundred things right and one thing 

wrong, according to the Law of righteousness, you would 

be unrighteous.</p><p> <i>But!</i> If you put your faith in 

Jesus, you would receive His righteousness—faith 

righteousness—even though you did ninety-nine out of a 

hundred things wrong! What a deal!</p>
<p>
There are many people today who wouldn’t consider 

themselves to be seeking after Law righteousness, but 

they really are. Their only hope of entering into 

heaven instead of hell is that they go to church, they 

try to be good, they live up to some standard of 

morality. That’s what this is talking about when it 

says the Jews weren’t seeking righteousness by faith 

but by the Law.<br> They were trying to earn what God had 

given as a gift.</p>
<h3>
The rest of Romans 9:32 says,
</h3>
<p><dr 

class="alt5">
For they stumbled at that stumbling stone.</dr 

class="alt5"><br>

It is offensive to people, particularly if they have a 

lot of holy actions to their names, when you tell them 

that all their good deeds don’t make them righteous 

before God. Then when you tell them sinners who only 

put faith in God are more righteous than they are 

(Matt. 21:28-32), that really puts them over the top!<br>

They say, “You mean I’m not any better than the person 

who’s been out living in sin?”

That’s exactly what I’m saying. That’s exactly what 

Paul and Jesus said.<br>

“Well, what have I been doing all this for?”

Good deeds will help you, to a degree, in your 

relationships with people, but they won’t give you any 

clout with God. You could have more holy acts than 

anyone you know, but who wants to be the best sinner 

who ever went to hell? <br><dr class="alt5">for <i>all</i> have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,(Rom. 3:23).</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
We need a Saviour! The only thing we have to offer is 

faith. We just believe the nearly-too-good-to-be-true 

news that Jesus died for us and paid a debt we couldn’t 

pay and gave us a righteousness we couldn’t earn. <br>It’s 

faith righteousness!</p>
<p>
“Well, I believe in Jesus, but I believe I also have to 

live holy to be accepted by God.”

That’s saying Jesus’ payment for sin wasn’t enough—that 

you have to add to what Jesus has done—and I believe 

that is the greatest sin of all! Jesus either paid for 

it all, or He paid for nothing at all!<br> It’s not Jesus 

plus you; it’s Jesus or you! It’s not you doing the 

best you can and then Jesus making up the difference 

with grace and mercy. If you try to mix the two, you 

have totally polluted what Jesus has done. It’s either 

faith righteousness or your righteousness, but not a 

combination of the two. <br><dr class="alt5">And if by grace, then it is no longer of works; otherwise grace is no longer grace. But if it is of works, it is no longer grace; otherwise work is no longer work. (Rom 11:6)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
It takes a supernatural revelation by the Holy Spirit 

to be able to understand this. But once you do, it’ll 

transform the way that you view God, the way that you 

relate to God, and the way that you receive from God.<br> 

The Gospel is the power of God to salvation. I 

encourage you to just humble yourself and ask God for a 

supernatural revelation of this truth. <br>It’s 

tremendous.</p>
<p>
When you truly get a hold of the grace of God, I 

guarantee you, it sets you free from sin, not free to 

sin. You’ll wind up living holier accidentally than you 

ever have on purpose. You’ll serve God out of love 

stricter and stronger than you ever would have out of 

legalism.</p>
<p>
Jesus said <dr class="alt5">"And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” (John 8:32)</dr class="alt5">.<br> It’s not truth that sets you 

free; it’s the truth you know that sets you free.<br> But 

before you can know it, you’ve got to hear it.<br><dr class="alt5"> Faith 

comes by hearing and hearing by the Word of God (Rom. 

10:17)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
