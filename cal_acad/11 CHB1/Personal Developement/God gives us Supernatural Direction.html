 <h1>
God gives us Supernatural Direction
</h1>
<p>
It is true that God guides us with a guidance we cannot explain.<br> Beyond God’s protection and our recollection, there abides the fact of God’s supernatural direction. The story of the Exodus moves far beyond what mere humans can fathom: <dr class="alt5">And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so as to go by day and night. (Ex 13:21)</dr class="alt5"> That way they could travel whether it was day or night.<br>
Israel never forgot this striking manifestation of God’s presence with them. They remembered it in the Psalms, the Prophets, and even in the New Testament. The pillars of cloud and fire burned their way into the collective memory of Israel.</p>
<h3>
This supernatural guidance was timely.
</h3>
<p> 
Evidently, the tribes rendezvoused at Succoth. From there, they marched to Etham on the edge of the desert (Ex 13:20). There was a clearly marked pathway from Egypt to Succoth. But at Etham, they entered the trackless wilderness. They were at the edge of nowhere: no markers, no signs, just desert. At the very moment they needed the intervention of God, and not a moment before, God provided them with the miraculous intervention of cloud and fire.</p>
<p>
As we struggle with our decisions during these days, we will find some impressions come to us naturally and others will come from beyond the natural. We will weigh our incomes, our obligations, our potential, and our church’s needs. But beyond that, there will be another factor: the intervention of God. Weaving in and around the natural, there will steal over us the sense of God’s supernatural guidance.</p>
<h3>
God’s guidance
</h3>
<p>
What can we learn as a practical lesson concerning God’s guidance in these days as we reflect on this great biblical story? God guides us externally and God guides us internally. How does God do that? God guides us externally through circumstances, counsel, and consequences.
God guides us through circumstances. Israel took a detour because the people were not ready to face the enemy. God will use our personal circumstances to help us in our decisions in these days to give to our church’s future.</p>
<p>
God also uses the external method of counsel. From testimony, in meetings for prayer, and in personal conversation, we will all take counsel as we move toward our decision of sacrificial giving.
God also guides us through consequences. The consequences of past actions enable us to weigh our future actions as God leads us. As we reflect upon the consequences of faithful giving to God in the past, we will be enabled to make wise decisions about giving in the future. But these external signs of God’s guidance are complemented by the internal.</p>
<h3>
Internally and subjectively
</h3>
<p>
God guides us by common sense. Do not think that God’s guidance will lead us to make an irrational decision. God’s guidance in our lives will, most of the time, use the judgement God has given us in common sense.<br>
But to balance that, God also will lead us through compulsions. There will be an instant in which God will break through and we will simply know that this is the will of God. We will be moved by the impulse, that inward bending of our wills toward the will of another.<br>
At the same time, God will guide us inwardly through conscience. That inner voice which whispers in the night “this is the right thing to do and that is the wrong” will be used of God to guide us.</p>
<p>
But finally, there will be an inner sense of contentment when we have made a decision in the will of God.</p>
