You Need a Vision for Your Life
</h1>
<p>
You need a God-given vision for your life. Without it, you'll always wander and flounder. Prov 29 says, <dr class="alt5">"Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint; but happy is he who keeps the law ..." (Prov 29:18) </dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
When there is no clear-cut direction or goal for which to live, human beings feel purposeless. When that hopeless feeling seizes the heart, mind and emotions, it doesn't take long until man begins to slide into a pit of despair. It's just as the Bible says: <br>"Where there is no revelation, the people cast off restraint ..."<p> 
<p>
What does the Bible mean when it says people "cast off restraint" if they have no vision? Several good translations of Prov 29:18 are as follows:<br>
"Where there is no vision, the people live purposeless, meaningless lives ..."<br>
"Where there is no vision, the people have no sense of direction and lose their reason for living ..."<br>
"Where there is no vision, people become lazy, dissatisfied, and sluggish ..."<br>
"Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint and become undisciplined and unproductive ..."<br>
People need a sense of direction. They need borders. They need guidelines.</p> 
<p>
And that includes me as well! I can personally testify that when I have no purpose, vision, or goal for my life, I sink to unbelievably low levels of inactivity and laziness. It's just a fact of life that I need something to shoot for and to keep me going. </p>
<p>
God put it into the heart of man to take dominion (Gen. 1:26) and to achieve something great with his life. When man loses that purpose—that God-birthed spark in his heart to reach out for something great and significant—he becomes dysfunctional, lazy, lethargic, languid, and lackadaisical in his approach to life.</p> 
<p>
That's why a person needs a challenging goal to aim for with his life. <br>
When that person has a vision before him, he has a goal to live for and an objective for which to shoot. This gives meaning to his existence; a purpose and plan designed specifically for his life. <br>
It gives him a reason to get up in the morning, a reason to keep fighting against the odds he encounters along the way. A vision gives him inspiration and motivation to keep striving until he's reached what God put in his heart.</p> 
<p>
Maintaining a clear-cut, unambiguous, indisputable vision is vital for my life. <br>It is like a trail I can follow. That trail may occasionally lead me through dense forests, dry places, and even occasional danger. 
But I know that if I stay on track, the vision God placed in my heart will lead me to His destination for my life. </p>
<p>
If I get off the track and try to take another route, it always gets me in trouble. The vision God gave me is like a rock I can lay hold of and hang on to. It is like a beacon that keeps me on track with my faith, my marriage, my family, my church, my ministry, my time, my energy, my money, and my efforts.<br>
When I have a vision, I live a full, meaningful, and rewarding life.<br>
When I have a vision, I live with a sense of direction and experience a reason for living.<br>
When I have a vision, I am disciplined, diligent, hard-working, and full of energy.<br>
When I have a vision, I feel fruitful, productive, and satisfied with my life.</p>
<p> 
But let's step back for a moment, and ask, "What is a vision?"<br> The word "vision" in Hebrew means, "to see."<br> It is the idea of having a mental image so sharp and so clear that you are able to "picture" something in your mind. </p>
<p>
This is not an abstract idea you can't latch on to; it's a concept so concrete that you can easily grab hold of it and say, "That's it! I see it! I know exactly what I'm supposed to be doing with my life!" <br>
But when God spoke to me, I was able to "see" what He was asking me to do. It wasn't just an abstruse fancy floating somewhere out in the spirit realm.<br> It was a dream that took shape and materialised in my heart and mind.<br> 

I could literally "see" it in my mind. I could visualise precisely what God was calling me to do. It was direction so strong that I could stand on it and move with confidence as I began to fulfil it. </p>
<p>
When I think of how God likes to plant His dreams and visions in our hearts, I am reminded of how He spoke to Abraham in Gen 15.<dr class="alt5"> Then He brought him outside and said, “Look now toward heaven, and count the stars if you are able to number them.” And He said to him, “So shall your descendants be.”(Gen 15:5)</dr class="alt5">. </p>
<p>
God put an "image" in Abraham's mind he would never forget. Abraham saw a "vision" of what God wanted to do through him. That vision stayed with Abraham for the rest of his life. He was never able to forget or get away from what he had "pictured" that night when God first spoke to him. <br>
That vision is what kept him going year after year, through thick and thin, through good times and bad, until it was finally fulfilled in his life. </p>
<p>
Without a vision, we flounder and struggle with lethargy. With a vision, we flourish, we achieve success, and we fulfil our God-given purpose.<br> Do you have a vision from God for your life? If not, pray and seek His vision ... your life will be infinitely more satisfying and meaningful because of it. </p>
