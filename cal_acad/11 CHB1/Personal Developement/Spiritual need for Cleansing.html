 <h1>
Spiritual need for Cleansing
</h1>
<h2>
Hardness of Heart
</h2>
<p><dr class="alt5">
“For they had not understood about the loaves, because their heart was 

hardened.” (Mark 6:52)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
The word understand means “to study, ponder, deliberate, examine, or 

think upon.” The scriptural term that would relate to “understand” 

would be the word “meditate.” Or we could substitute the word “focus” 

for “understand.” <br>So the disciple's hearts were hard, since they didn’t 

“focus” on the miracle of Jesus feeding the 5,000.</p>
<h3>
Focusing on the Natural instead of the Supernatural 
</h3>
<p>
It wasn’t sin that caused the disciple's hearts to be hard—it was their 

focus on things other than the miracle Jesus had just performed. They 

were occupied with trying to save their lives in the midst of the 

storm. That wasn’t sin.</p>
<p>
This is what was wrong with the disciples. They had just witnessed 

Jesus taking five small loaves of bread and two small fish, and feeding 

an entire multitude of at least 15,000 people.<br> What an awesome miracle! 

If they had kept their minds stayed on that miracle, they wouldn’t have 

been shocked or surprised to see Jesus walking on the water.<br>
Notice that<dr class="alt5"> He made His disciples get into the boat (Mark 6:45)</dr class="alt5">  <br>This specially mentions the fact that Jesus 

“made” His disciples to get into the boat and go to the other side.<br> 

That means He had to compel them. They didn’t want to go, but Jesus 

made them do it. Therefore, they didn’t get into this situation because 

of some mistake on their part; they were under direct orders from the 

Master.<br> That means Jesus was responsible for what happened to them.</p>
<h3>
Thinking Spiritually
</h3>
<p>
If they had been thinking spiritually instead of naturally, they would 

have known that Jesus would take care of them. Instead of being 

surprised to see Jesus walking on the water, they would have expected 

it.</p>
<p>
Likewise, if we were not so dominated by considering the natural, we 

would not be surprised by the supernatural. We should expect to see the 

miraculous power of God manifest in our lives all the time. But the 

truth is, our hearts have become hardened toward God and His 

supernatural power because of our failure to stay focused on spiritual 

things.</p>
<p>
One of the benefits of understanding what causes hard heartedness is 

that you can reverse this process and use it to become hardened against 

the devil. That is absolutely true. You have the power to determine 

what your heart accepts or rejects.<br>

For example, you cannot be tempted with something you cannot think. <br>You 

won’t act in a way that you haven’t already considered in your mind. <br>

So, control your thoughts and you’ll control your actions.<br> That’s 

simple but profound. Most people don’t operate that way.</p>
<p>
One of the ways to soften your heart toward God is to just sit and soak 

in the truth during your quiet time. <br>It’s not enough just to hear truth; you need to absorb 

it.</p>
 
<h2>
Selfishness
</h2>
<p>
Selfishness is putting your goals, priorities and needs first before 

everyone else even those who are really in need.<br>

But what makes people selfish?
Why do some people give away everything that others need while some 

never do it?
Is selfishness the result of self love?</p>
<h3>
The truth about selfishness</h3>
<p>
Selfishness is sign of weakness, the selfish person fears to give some 

of his time, money or effort to others because he is afraid of the 

consequences that might happen on making such a sacrifice.</p>
<p>
The person who is always busy and who never gives few minutes of his 

time to God or the the people in need is actually afraid of wasting his 

time because of believing that he has no control over his life.<br> When 

that person gives away some of his time he feels insecure because of 

not being sure whether he will succeed in completing his own tasks or 

not.<br>

If that person didn’t fear to lose control of his life or if he was 

confident enough to believe that giving five minutes away won’t hurt 

his progress then he wouldn’t have been selfish.</p>
<h3>
Selfishness and unmet goals
</h3>
<p>
All of us have dreams and goals but some of us believe that they might 

not be able to reach them and that’s why they save all of their 

resources to themselves just to ease some of the insecurity they are 

feeling.<br>

Lots of selfish people have big unmet needs which make them feel 

insecure and the result is being afraid to give anything away not to 

remind themselves of their lack of control over their lives.</p>
<h3>
How to get over selfishness
</h3>
<p>
1) Understand that in most cases selfishness is weakness.</p>
<p>
2) Learn how to feel confident about your plans, goals, dreams and 

meeting your needs so that you can give without feeling afraid.</p>
<p>
3) Build more self confidence in dealing with your own life problems so 

that you get rid of the fear of loss of control</p>

<h2>
Inferiority
</h2>
<p>
 Losers speak words of defeat. Words of death and not of life. 

Grumbling and complaining words pour out of their mouths like poison. 

On the other hand, ever been around a winner? Their words are edifying 

and are encouraging to themselves and all those around them.<br>

Jesus is our example of how to walk and talk victoriously. People 

flocked to Him like bees to honey. Let His loving, positive thinking 

and positive speaking life be your pattern for daily living, bearing 

good fruit in word and action.</p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
"Death and life are in the power of the tongue, and those who love it 

will eat its fruit" (Prov 18:21)</dr class="alt5">.
<p><dr class="alt5">
"He who guards his mouth preserves his life, but he who opens wide his 

lips shall have destruction." (Prov 13:3)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
I also learned we paint and create pictures on the inside of us with 

our words. A person that speaks negatively can paint and create a 

negative and defeated image on the inside of them.<br> A person that speaks 

positive words (God's promises) will create a winning image on the 

inside of them.</p>
<p>
He showed me we are to keep a watch over our mouth and mind. To only 

say and think things in line with His will, His Word. For God hates 

grumbling and complaining. It opens the door for the enemy to attack 

you spiritually, soulfully or physically.</p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
"Set a guard, O Lord, over my mouth; keep watch over the door of my 

lips" (Psa 141:3)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
I want to remind you who you are in Christ. Let these glorious 

attributes saturate your mind as you daily think and ponder them.<br> In 

Christ you are:<br>

Victorious, an overcomer, triumphant, more than a conqueror.<br> A child of 

God, an heir of God, holy, His workmanship, a new creation.<br> A king, a 

priest, the temple of the holy spirit, the light of the world, an 

ambassador for Christ, beloved of God, blessed, healed, saved, redeemed 

(set free by His ransom).<br> A living stone, protected, filled with God's 

love and faith, you have the wisdom of God, you have the mind of 

Christ, called to walk in glory, virtue and His perfect will, complete 

in Christ, prosperous, have all power, riches, strength, honour.<br> Your 

steps are ordered by the Lord and you can hear His voice.</p>
<p>
That's a mouthful, but it is all true because God cannot lie. It is up 

to you to believe it.<br>
Tear down those strongholds with God's Word. Begin to daily boldly 

speak and declare who you are in Christ even if your mind argues with 

you and says it isn't true. <br>Tell your mind to shut up in Jesus' name 

and get in line with God's Word. Refuse to think and speak words of 

poverty, lack and defeat.<br> Let God's promises become more real to you 

than your circumstances.<br> You are what God says you are. You are 

destined by God to win in this life!</p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
"If God be for us, who can be against us" (Rom 8:3)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
I hope this message of hope will encourage you to keep a watch over 

your mind and mouth, to only think and say things in line with God's 

Word, which is His will for your life. <br>As you memorise, meditate and 

assimilate God's promises of who you are in Christ and what your 

inheritance is in Christ, then you will be building the image within 

you that is destined to win, prosper and advance God's Kingdom on earth 

as you daily submit to His will.</p>
