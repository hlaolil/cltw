   <h1>
The Real Worth of Man
</h1>
<h3>
Our value as God's children
</h3>
<p>
The Bible actually has many passages that tell us what God has to say about our worth and our value in His eyes.<br> Gen 1 says <dr class="alt5">God created man in His own image; in the image of God.<br> (Gen 1:27)</dr class="alt5">.<br> Psa 139 says we are <dr class="alt5">fearfully and wonderfully made, and in Your book they all were written, the days fashioned for me, when as yet there were none of them. (Psa 139:14,16)</dr class="alt5"><br> Eph 1 says<dr class="alt5"> He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, (Eph 1:4)</dr class="alt5"> and also in Eph 1 we’re told we are God’s own <dr class="alt5">purchased possession, to the praise of His glory.(Eph 1:14)</dr class="alt5"> and that we have an inheritance in heaven with Him as His children.</p>
<h3>
The price God paid to make us worthy
</h3>
<p>
But notice the wording in each of the above phrases:<br> “are created,” “are fearfully and wonderfully made,” “were written,” “God chose us,” “we are God’s own possession,” and “we have an inheritance.” <br>These phrases all have one thing in common: they are things done to us or for us by God. <br>These are not things we have done for ourselves, nor have we earned or deserved them. We are, in fact, merely the recipients of <dr class="alt5">“every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ,” (Eph 1:3)</dr class="alt5">.<br> Therefore, we can conclude that our worth is not really of the “self” at all; rather, it is worth given to us by God.<br> We are of inestimable value to Him because of the price He paid to make us worthy—<font color="firebrick">the death of His Son on the cross.</font></p>
<p>
The Bible tells us that <dr class="alt5">“while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” <br>(Rom 5:8)</dr class="alt5">.<br> In fact, we <dr class="alt5">“were dead in trespasses and sins” (Eph 2:1)</dr class="alt5">. What worth is there in dead things? None.<br> <dr class="alt5"> For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him (2 Cor 5:21)</dr class="alt5"> not because we were worthy of it, but because we were unworthy, unlovable, and unable to make ourselves worthy in any way.<br> But—and here’s the miracle—<dr class="alt5"> God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life (John 3:16)</dr class="alt5"> and because He did, we now have infinite worth.</p>
<h3>
Seeing ourselves as God sees us
</h3>
<p>
John 1 tells us that <dr class="alt5">as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name: (John 1:12)</dr class="alt5"> <br>1 John 1 tells us that <dr class="alt5">If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. (1 John 1:9)</dr class="alt5"> <br>If we focus on how much God loves us and the price He paid to redeem us, we’ll come to see ourselves as God sees us, and that will help us understand just how much we’re really worth as children of the most high God.</p>
<p>
Our self-worth is too often based on what other people tell us about ourselves. The one, true authority on our self-worth is Jesus Christ, and since He gave His own life up for us by dying on a cross, that should tell us just how valuable we really are.</p>
