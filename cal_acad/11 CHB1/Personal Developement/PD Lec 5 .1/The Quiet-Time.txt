<h1>
The Quiet-Time
</h1>
<h3>
Introduction
</h3>
<p>
God has called us into fellowship with His son, Jesus Christ our Lord (cf. 1 Cor 1:9). The term “fellowship” in this case means to “share our lives in common,” to “become friends” of the most intimate sort. Though He is King and Sovereign, He dwells with the humble in heart and under new covenant provisions has taken up residence, as Paul says, in our hearts (Rom 5:5). The miracle is that He wants to know me and make Himself known to me in increasingly intimate ways. The Divine Family has come to abide in me (John 14:23) and I am called to remain in Christ (John 15:7). I need to know Him (Phil 3:10-11). I was created to love Him, serve Him, and above all enjoy Him forever. How can we neglect “so great a salvation” (Heb 2:3)?</p>
<p>
But there are bumps and potholes in the road and the journey is filled with pitfalls, distractions (surely the worst enemy of the committed Christian), and struggles. In the midst of the fight—and that is certainly what it is—we are really asking for two things.</p>
<p>
Strength and comfort, power and peace, in our walking with God, are the things of our desires. Were any of us asked seriously, what it is that troubles us, we must refer it to one of these heads:—either we want strength or power, vigour and life, in our obedience, in our walking with God; or we want peace, comfort or consolation therein. Whatever it is that may befall a believer that does not belong to one of these two heads, does not deserve to be mentioned in the days of our complaints.</p>
<h3>
What Is A Quiet-Time?
</h3>
<p>
In order to worship God properly we need strength and consolation in the Christian life. Strength to faithfully obey and consolation when we fail. In particular, we need strength to pray, to meditate on Scripture in Christ’s presence, and to obey what God makes known to us. We need mercy in our times of wandering from the Lord.</p>
<p>
Paul told the Thessalonians to “pray without ceasing” and God told Joshua to meditate on His word day and night (1 Thess 5:17; Joshua 1:8). And this we do as well. We praise the Lord in our cars going to work and we make intercession for others as we go through our day. Some people also memorise scripture on their way to work and think about it all day long, asking God for further insight and strength to follow Him. The point is that we often pray and think about scripture as we’re engaged in other activities.</p>
<p>
But as we flow in these two important privileges (i.e., prayer and the Word) throughout the day, we run into distractions, interruptions, and other important “things” that we must respond to and give our undivided attention to. Therefore, there arises the need in the yearning soul to draw aside for regular times of uninterrupted prayer and scriptural meditation. This is what I mean by a quiet-time. It is a time set aside in a certain place where a person can “get away,” be alone, and draw near to the Lord. Thus a quiet-time involves a period of concentrated, uninterrupted fellowship with God in a place often designated beforehand. As important as prayer throughout the day is—and it is important—it comes with distractions and our heart is somewhat divided; it’s the nature of the case. Again, the discipline of having a daily quiet-time is designed to give a person undivided time with the Lord.</p>
<p>
Before we move on, however, let me clarify one thing. This article is posted on a website which thousands and thousands of people visit each day. And we’re thankful to God for that! But this means that there will be many readers out there who come from different religious and societal backgrounds. So I need to make one thing clear right up front: having a quiet does not secure favour with God; it is the privilege and joy of a redeemed heart—a heart that has already entered into friendship with Him through faith in Jesus Christ. If you have not yet repented of your sin and turned to trust in Christ for forgiveness and cleansing, I encourage to do that now. If the point of a quiet-time is fellowship with God, then let that begin now by turning to Him in faith and calling on the name of the Lord! He will forgive you whatever sins you’ve committed, cleansing and strengthening you for life in communion with Him (cf. 1 John 1:9).</p>
<p>
So then, we are not working for grace, but from grace. We’re not hoping that God will accept us; we know that He already has in Christ (1 John 5:13). What He wants with us now is a deeper friendship and intimacy.</p>
<h3>
Why Have A Consistent Quiet-Time?
</h3>
<p>
There are as many reasons for having a consistent quiet-time as there are benefits that flow from these times of undistracted prayer and scriptural meditation. I want to subsume them, however, under three general headings. First, we seek the Lord’s presence in undistracted fellowship simply because He has called us into this friendship; the cry of the regenerate heart is to know God and enjoy Him forever. Second, the Lord uses consistent quiet-times to transform us into his likeness. Third, drawing aside regularly to be with the Lord not only leads to a deeper friendship with him and to Christ-like transformation, but it also impacts our view of the world and the mission God has called us to. It is through regular fellowship with the Lord that we begin to get on our hearts what’s on his heart. It is here that we begin to develop a passion for reaching the lost and world missions. Let’s look at each of these in a little more detail.</p>
<h3>
Knowing Christ - Intimacy with a Friend
</h3>
<p>
The first and ultimate reason we set aside a specific time in which to draw aside and be with the Lord is the exciting thought of deepening our friendship with Him. Jesus said in John 15:14-15 that He no longer calls His disciples “slaves,” but “friends.” We are no longer in the dark as to what our Master is doing, but we have been graciously invited into the inner circle—the divine circle in this case—and privileged with the knowledge of what our Master is feeling, thinking, and doing. Though we sometimes act like it, we are not mere acquaintances, but each of us who knows Christ personally, is His friend. Everything that Jesus has heard from His Father He has willingly made known to us. To open up your heart to someone, as God has done with us, is a gesture of friendship.</p>
<p>
Where are you? Is Christ a deep personal friend to you or merely an acquaintance? Would you recognise Him if you bumped into Him on the street (cf. Luke 24:13-27)? Do you desire His company and do you know Him well or are you fiddling around in life with second and third best? Listen to God through the prophet Jeremiah: <dr class="alt5">
“Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, let not the mighty man glory in his might, nor let the rich man glory in his riches; but let him who glories glory in this, that he understands and knows Me, that I am the Lord, exercising loving kindness, judgement, and righteousness in the earth. For in these I delight,” says the Lord.” (Jer 9:23-24)</dr class="alt5">. The quiet-time is a specific time in which we seek the face of the Lord, to know His friendship personally and to worship and understand Him better.</p>
<p>
The friendship into which God has called us—also referred to as <dr class="alt5">
the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord (1 Cor 1:9</dr class="alt5">
)—came with a severe price. John says the Lord Jesus laid down His life for us: <dr class="alt5">
“Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life for his friends.” (John 15:13)</dr class="alt5">. Jesus has left His palace, moved across town, lived in the slums, and has rescued us for Himself, so that we might enjoy His presence in friendship. Surely we can set aside time to be alone with Him!</p>
<p>
A good and vibrant friendship is built on many necessary and beautiful virtues. One of them is willing disclosure. Another is a “willingness to risk” or courage. A third is mercy. All of them are grounded in love for another person and result in the desire to “make oneself known” and to leave the response in God’s hands. For there can be no intimate friendship without a willingness to lay one’s heart on one’s sleeve. This Jesus has done. His desire for friendship is not rooted in co dependence or sinful weakness, but rather in the riches of His over abundant love and concern for us. It is also motivated in the hope of a reciprocal gesture on our part. Jesus has graciously invited each of us into His story; His friendship is life changing. This is the ultimate reason we draw aside to be with Him. This is ultimately why we have a quiet-time.</p>
<h3>
Becoming like Christ -  Finding Strength for Holiness
</h3>
<p>
Not only do I spend time with Jesus in order to know Him better, that is, to deepen the friendship and to enjoy Him, but also to receive both His values and the strength it takes for living them out. It is through personal communion and friendship with the Lord, especially in quiet-time when there are no distractions, that I listen and am able to receive from Him. Over the years of fellow shipping intimately with the Lord, a most unusual thing happens: I start to think and act like Him, albeit imperfectly. I notice myself hating what He hates and loving what He loves. Have you noticed that? This is the heart of the new covenant ministry of the Spirit wherein He focuses our attention on Christ and in the process transforms us into our Friend’s image from one degree of glory to another.  Paul says: <dr class="alt5">
“But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord.” (2 Cor 3:18)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
It is in fellow shipping with the Lord that we begin to really hate sin and love righteousness. It is in that time that we resolve to say “no” to sin and “yes” to God. It is there that we experience the greatest impact of His friendship on our lives. It is there that we receive mercy from the Lord for all our sin and find grace to help us in our weakness (Heb 4:16). It is there that we learn to cast all our cares, problems, anxieties, and concerns upon the one who cares for us (1 Pet 5:7). This is how Christ’s strength is conveyed directly to us. It is through prayerful meditation on scripture in His presence—with our eyes on Him—that we receive mercy and grace to help us in time of need. It is in that daily time of unhindered communion that the Lord draws us a picture, as it were, of His loveliness!</p>
<h3>
The Spirit of God
</h3>
This is the point of the quiet-time, namely, to allow the Spirit of God to draw you a picture of Christ’s loveliness. Though we cannot see Him, we do begin to behold His glory during prayer and meditation. It is in His presence in this way that we are convicted of our sin and shown what it means to be holy. It is here that we begin to learn what character is all about. So then, the second primary reason we draw aside to be alone with the Lord is so that we might get a clear “picture” of Him in order that we might become like Him. Not only do we draw aside in daily quiet-time so that we might deepen our friendship with Christ, but also so that we might allow that friendship to impact us, to change our character into His. Let me explain.</p>
<p>
God has chosen us in eternity past and predestined us to be conformed to the image of His Son (Eph 1:3-4; Rom 8:29). That’s where we’re heading. Christ-like character. He has given us several “means of grace” to accomplish this. First, of course, is the Spirit of God who unites us with Christ in His death and resurrection. The Spirit uses other “means” such as the word of God, the people of God, the sacraments prescribed by God, as well as the circumstances God ordains for our lives. All these combine in a divine mix to bring about Christ likeness in us. The end and goal of the process is realised at glorification (Rom 8:30). So then, we need to ask the question: “What is our God-given responsibility throughout this process until glorification?”</p>
<p>
First, we must recognise that we are in a fight and that growth in Christ likeness will not come without struggle. We are in a fight for holiness against three formidable enemies: the world, the flesh, and the Devil. Listen to John and Paul on the matter:</p>
<p>
Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not of the Father but is of the world. (1 John 2:15-16)</p>
<p>
For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish. (Gal 5:17)</p>
<p>
<dr class="alt5">
For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places. (Eph 6:12)</dr class="alt5">
</p>
<p>
Second, in the midst of this war. <dr class="alt5">
Beloved, I beg you as sojourners and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul,” (1 Peter 2:11)</dr class="alt5">
 </p>
<p>
Again listen to Paul:</p>
<p>
Gal 6:7-8 Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life.</p>
<p>
Paul said that we have these “means of grace,” supremely managed and ignited by the Spirit of holiness, so that we might cooperate with the Spirit’s work of sanctifying us. He leads, we follow (Phil 2:12-13). This involves us in the moment-by-moment, ongoing process of saying “yes” to God and “no” to sin. Daily, we say “yes” to faith and love, “yes” to truthfulness, “yes” to purity, honesty, self-control, and compassion. Daily, we say “yes” to sound doctrine, courage, conviction, and Christ-like humility. But we say “no” to slothfulness, laziness, and lying. We say “no” to deceit, sexual immorality, adultery, slander, gossip, unrighteous anger, idolatry, envy, strife, and murder. The former are consistent with our new calling and the latter are inconsistent. God loves the former and hates the latter. Therefore, let us put on the “new man” in our relationships and put off the “old man.” Let us <dr class="alt5">
“put on the Lord Jesus and make no provision for the flesh to fulfil its lusts” (Rom 13:14)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
<p>
Now the Spirit does a most incredible feat as we follow him in saying “yes” to righteousness and “no” to sin: He transforms our character. We begin to acquire deep seated dispositions toward righteousness and a loathing for sin. A new character is forming, one that in its weakness is actually stronger in the Lord. We become stronger through Him and less blown and tossed by every wind of doctrine and every problem that God permits to enter our airspace. 
This is what it means to grow up in Christ. Our character determines in large measure the fruitfulness of our lives. To be sure, none of us reaches perfection in this life and our goal is not to be rigid moralists, but to love Christ and others. Thus renewed repentance and trust is constantly required. But make no mistake about it, Christ-like character is not instantaneous, but is rather forged by the Word and Spirit, over time, through the furnace, with the help of God’s people, as we learn to say “yes” to God and “no” to our enemies.</p>
<p>
And so it is in the Christian life. Developing the Christ-like habit of saying “yes” to God—a habit nurtured in quiet-time—develops a disposition in us that enables us to withstand greater “loads” placed upon us—loads that perhaps right now we might crumble under.</p>
<p>
The one character trait that we need along the way is perseverance and does it ever seem to be in short supply these days. There are times when we all want to quit and throw in the towel. I cannot tell you how many times I have felt that way with respect to the ministry. But when I draw aside to be with the Lord and He shines His light into my heart and sets me on my feet again, everything changes. I am reminded of the words: <dr class="alt5">
“For consider Him who endured such hostility from sinners against Himself, lest you become weary and discouraged in your souls” (Heb 12:3)</dr class="alt5">
. This is why God has placed us in a community, given us His word, and called us to His side through the Spirit. That is why we need to daily fellowship with Him in prayer and scriptural meditation. He gives us new and fresh grace for the battle. The habit of meeting with Him daily to strengthen the bond of our friendship is like daily renewing marriage vows and commitments; it reminds us to whom we belong and gives us encouragement to live faithfully in the relationship.</p>
<h3>
Living for Christ - A vision for the world
</h3>
<p>
So we see that daily, uninterrupted communion with the Lord deepens our friendship with the Saviour. We also see that it is in those times of talking alone with Him that He begins to impact us in terms of a holy life. We begin to take in His values and virtues and to discard those that are not worthy of Him. Thus we often leave our times of intimate fellowship with Christ and hit the day with renewed zeal to say “yes” to God and “no” to sin. Over time a character is formed in us. </p>
<p>
But there is a third reason we seek to fellowship daily with the Lord in quiet-time. It is so that we can get on our hearts what is on His heart, namely, His church and the salvation of lost sinners (e.g., world missions). It is when we are with Him that we are impacted by His mind on the issue. Again, there has never been a movement of God that is not in one way or another connected to prayer and the saints communing with their Lord. Remember that Jesus called the disciples to be with Him so that by being with Him He might make them fishers of men. <dr class="alt5">
 Then Jesus said to them, “Follow Me, and I will make you become fishers of men.” (Mark 1:17)</dr class="alt5">
. Later He chose twelve <dr class="alt5">
“that they might be with Him and that He might send them out to preach,” (Mark 3:14)</dr class="alt5">. 
Notice the order: 
(1) they spent time with Jesus, and <br>
(2) He sent them out. <br>
The inevitable result of being with Jesus, as the pattern in the life of the disciples illustrates, is a desire and commitment to serve Him both by serving His people and by carrying the gospel to the world.</p>
<h3>
How Do I Have A Quiet-Time? 
</h3>
<p>
Some Principles<br>
As you go about this process remember that it will not be easy nor without a fight. That you can be sure of. So arm yourself. There are four things to think about. First, a consistent time. Second, a consistent place. Third, a consistent plan. Fourth, a reward.</p>
<h3>
A Consistent Time
</h3>
<p>
It is important in the process of developing a regular and meaningful quiet-time, where you can be alone and away from distractions, to nail down a specific time each day. For those of you who have a set schedule every day this is usually not too difficult. I find the best time is early in the morning, before I go to work. This may work for many guys who are working outside the home. Some of you may find the evening a better time. It’s up to you; trial and error. Others of us, say, women with young children, may find it easier to sit down and pray when the children are either having a nap or, if they’re old enough, immediately after they’ve gone to school and before the day gets rolling. The important thing is that you have a block of time (15 minutes? 30 minutes? 1 hour?, etc.) set aside each day (or as often as you can) in which to draw near to the Lord. Guard this time and ask the Lord to keep it free for prayer and meditation on scripture. Obviously we are not saying that you cannot have a quiet-time at any other time, but it is important in developing a good (holy) habit to pave the way by seeking consistency.</p>
<h3>
A Consistent Place
</h3>
<p>
Another important factor is a consistent place, preferably not in front of the T.V.! Again, think of a place where you will have no distractions (or at least as close to none as possible) and where you will have freedom to pray out loud. Again, we can have a quiet-time anywhere (e.g., on the train travelling to work), but not if we’re being distracted constantly by various intrusions. One of the reasons Jesus went up into the hills at night to pray was because there were no crowds there and he could focus on the Father without interruption. Whatever place we decide on, it should be similarly chosen.</p>
<h3>
A Consistent Plan
</h3>
<p>
Once we’ve decided on the place and time, we should then set about the task of determining what portion of scripture we’ll be reading. It should be a portion long enough to provide some context to the story or teaching, but short enough so that much time can be spent in meditating on what has been read. It is here that we ask the Lord not only what the text means, but also what it now means for me. I recommend a Psalm, a paragraph or two in Paul, or an episode in the narrative literature such as the gospels or OT. You will also want to take along a pen and journal to record your thoughts and to list things to pray about. In my prayers I often use the acronym ACTS: A=adoration; C=confession; T=thanksgiving; and S=supplication.</p>
<h3>
The Reward
</h3>
<p>
The best way to envision your quiet-time is not as another thing to do—on top of the already overwhelming list of things to do—but as an opportunity to deepen a bond of love with the ultimate Friend. We should look forward to it. My prayer is that God would fill our hearts with that sense of excitement and expectation as we come to fellowship with Him each day. Come to each quiet-time with that expectation and see if the Lord does not reward your seeking Him. I leave you with a passage of scripture:
<p><dr class="alt5">
But without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him. (Heb 11:6)</dr class="alt5">
