<h1>
Spiritual Growth - A Time to Grow
</h1>
<p>
Peter is writing to Christians and having told them in chapter one that they had been born again by the power of God's Word, he then issues a challenge to them. "Therefore, because you have been born again by the power of God," because you've been made a new person, because that Word of God is eternal, <dr class="alt5">"Therefore, laying aside all malice, all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and all evil speaking, as newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby, if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is gracious." (1 Peter 2:1-3)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Peter issues three commands to believers. He's not talking to unsaved people right at this point. He's talking to believers. Born again people. And his challenge is to grow. There are three commands that we want to look at here in our text and I express them in terms of Spurn, Yearn, and Learn. If you would grow in salvation, if you would have spiritual growth in your life, Spurn, Yearn, and Learn.</p>
<h3>
Laying aside -- Spurning
 </h3>
<p>
Laying aside denotes the image of taking off a garment in order to put another garment on. Laying aside, taking off. And note what believers are to take off. All malice. That's wickedness. Wickedness has to do with how people live who do not know Jesus Christ as Lord of their lives. In the Bible the wicked are simply those who do not know God. Whatever the particular sins in their life, that isn't the emphasis with the wicked. The wicked are simply those who do not know God, who do not know Jesus Christ.  Those who are born again are called to be different, to put off all sin. To live different lives. To live lives that take sin seriously. To live lives where repentance is a daily concern. To live lives that seek the honour of Jesus above all else. To live lives that turn away from the world and its allures and instead turn to God with whole hearted devotion and commitment. </p>
<p>
All guile 
</p>
Guile is deceitfulness. Taking off that garment, of deceit. Deceit is when you try to put one over on people, to your own profit and gain. To deceive for your own ends, to not be honest, forthright, a person of integrity.</p>
<p>
Hypocrisy
</p> 
Hypocrisy is playing the actor. Going through the role of what it is to be a Christian, but it's only show, it isn't reality. There isn't any substance. It's being a Christian so that you look good in the eyes of the community, Maybe it helps business. Playing the hypocrite, not being sincere in one's worship. It's only a fa√ßade. You may sing the hymns, you may sit in the church, but there isn't a reality there. Put it aside!</p>
<p>
Envy
</p> 
Someone has said that envy is the last sin to die. Envy is wanting what someone else has. Jesus' disciples were quite envious of one another. They debated among each other who should have the greatest seat of honour.
</p>
All slander. 
</p>
Slander is literally talking down a person. Talking about a person behind their back in such a way that you put the person down. It's also called gossip. Everyone believes gossip is wrong, but most everyone enjoys it. Peter says that's not the way truly born again people live.</p>
<p>
Spurn malice
</p>
 Malice is a desire to harm others or to see others suffer; extreme ill will or spite. 
 Cast it off like you do an old piece of clothing. All that stuff belongs to the old life. It doesn't belong to the Christian life. These things all have consequences. Sin always has consequences and "be sure your sin will always find you out," the Bible says if you're born again, if you can say that Jesus Christ is your Lord and Saviour then spurn. Are you spurning the world's attractions? Are you living like a believer?</p>
<h3>
Longing for -- Yearning 
</h3>
<p>
There's another command -- Yearn. If you would grow, it's not only to put off or lay aside these sins, that so beset Christians, but it is to yearn. <dr class="alt5">"And like newborn babes long for the pure milk of the Word." (1 Peter 2:2)</dr class="alt5">The Word translated long for is the same word found in <dr class="alt5">"As the deer pants for the water, so my soul pants after Thee." (Psa 42:1)</dr class="alt5">Are you finding a yearning in your heart for God? To know Him better, to grow closer to Him? This longing for the Word of God is a passion, a passion for the Word of God, a passion for Jesus Christ. He or she will long for His Word and will make every attempt to get to know God better through the pages of His Word.

Being a Christian is not dependent upon, nor is it summed up by, simply sitting in a pew and looking bored with the preacher. That isn't the Christian faith. The Christian faith is living dynamically. It's a yearning for God, to know God, to be excited about God.
This is a hard message, but we need hard messages to shake us. There is so much indifference and lukewarmness. And when God just gets the leftovers, if we have time or if it works out or if I've got the money, or if I'm not doing anything else, then God you get your due. You see the time is coming when only those churches that are strong, filled with vibrant and committed people, will endure. Like newborn babes long, yearn, desire. A little baby not only desires its mother's milk, but that baby has a powerful, instinctive urge for that milk and that's what Peter is talking about here. </p> 
<h3>
Learning 
</h3>
<p>
And then, Peter says, "Learn. Learn." "as newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that you may grow thereby." (1 Peter 2:2) Here it is. When you are spurning the wrong things, when you are yearning for the things of God and His presence, when you have a passion for Christ, then comes the learning. You grow in salvation. If you're not growing in your salvation, you're dying spiritually. Peter says, "People you were born again by the Word of God. But now, grow in respect to your salvation." And that's what this life then becomes, one of growing in the knowledge of God. Seeing Him increasingly as the greatest and highest and most excellent treasure in all the world. Is it too late to learn? No, it's never too late to learn. No matter how old you are you can still learn something!</p>
<p>
It's never too late to learn. Never too late. And especially that's true in terms of the Christian faith and growing in the Lord. And so, my friends, the challenge is to all of us, this is the time to grow. A time to be involved. A great time to be living and serving the Lord. Spurning the sins, Yearning for the things of God, His Word, and then Learning more of Him. It's good to get to know Him right now.</p>
<p>
To those of you who are believers, whose trust is Christ, this is the time to grow. Let's make the most of the time that God gives us.</p>
