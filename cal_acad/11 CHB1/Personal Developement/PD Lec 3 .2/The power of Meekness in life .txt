<h1>
The power of Meekness in life 
</h1>
<p>
To be meek is to be humble, to be lowly, to be gentle, to be submissive, to be patient, to be calm and quiet, to be unresisting, unruffled. In the world, the meek is despised; the humble is not reckoned with. The lowly is supposed to be trampled upon and life squeezed out of those who are gentle and submissive like the worm. But the principle of Christ is very, very different. <dr class="alt5">“Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.” (Matt 5:5)</dr class="alt5"> When things happen and people try to belittle you, to disregard you, to walk over you, be meek and be blessed. He (Christ, not they) is testing you: He is allowing them to test your Christian faith, to know whether you are lowly and humble or you are proud and haughty. He wants you to understand that the meek are those who are unresisting and unruffled when belittled and disregarded by others.</p>
<p>
The people of the world always go the opposite direction; while Christ teaches meekness, they preach self-confidence, self-esteem, self-assertion and self-respect. They want to show that they are not meek and they cannot be meek. The Lord does not want us to be like the civil rights activists fighting for our rights. Be meek. Don’t fight for anything, receive the message of Christ and have the mind of Christ. This is not a new revelation; it has always been the mind of God (Psa 37:11; Isa 29:19). The Lord is calling us to meekness of character, disposition and attitude that will be visible.</p>
<h3>
Proper perspective of Meekness
</h3>
<p>
Matt 5:5; Psa 45:4; Zeph 2:3; 1 Cor 4:21; 2 Cor 10:1; Eph 4:2; Matt 11:29; Col 3:12; 1 Peter 3:4; Gal 5:22-23. </p>
<p>
The meek are those who have mourned for their sins and the sins of others that they influenced to sin. Meekness shows that the forgiven sinner is grateful to God and appreciative of the blessing of God upon his life. There are seven things that are connected with meekness; you cannot separate meekness from them. They are:</p>
<p>(1) Meekness and truth </p>
<p>(2) Meekness and righteousness</p> 
<p>(3) Meekness and love</p>
<p>(4) Meekness and gentleness</p> 
<p>(5) Meekness and lowliness </p>
<p>(6) Meekness and humility</p> 
<p>(7) Meekness and a quiet spirit.</p> 
<p>The meekness that is acceptable in the sight of the Lord is joined and connected with truth, righteousness, love, gentleness, lowliness, humility and quietness of spirit. Meekness is one of the fruit of the Spirit. Meekness enables us to submit unto God and to quietly endure provocations from man without being inflamed.</p> 
<h3>
Proven people with Meekness
</h3>
<p>
Num 12:1-13; Gen 13:5-12; 14:1-2,11-16; Gen 18:17-32; 19:15-17,29; 2 Sam 16:5-14; Matt 11:28-30; Isa 53:7-10; 2 Tim 2:24-26; Eph 4:1,2,15.</p>
<p>
The lifestyle of Moses shows his meekness. In spite of the envy and jealousy of Aaron and Miriam against Moses, the Bible says “the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.” This meekness, like Christ’s meekness, is not the same as weakness of character, lack of conviction, timidity of spirit or passive disposition of temper as seen in Aaron (Ex 32:1,21-22), Eli (1 Sam 2:22-24) or David (1 Kings 1:5-6).</p>
<p> 
Meekness without conviction or courage leads to compromise and judgement. Christ in His meekness did not fail to warn unrepentant sinners (Matt 11:20-30). Meekness makes us not to fight back or defend self but we uphold and defend God’s glory. When Miriam became leprous as a result of her misdeed against Moses, he “... cried out to the Lord, saying, “Please heal her, O God, I pray!.” (Num 12:13) He was not one of those who want their enemies to suffer because they offend them. Also, although Abraham was older than Lot, because he was meek, he avoided a possible clash that would have followed the problem their servants had. Those who are meek do not fight over their rights or property. Abraham did not rejoice in the problem of Lot in spite of what he had done to him. Meekness always enables those who have been hurt to help those who have hurt them. When you are meek, there is no end to the help you render. The angels delivered Lot because of Abraham’s intercession. These Bible characters submitted themselves to God and quietly endured provocations from man without being inflamed. If they were able to do it, we are well able through the grace we receive from the Lord.</p>
<h3>
Promised possession for the Meek
</h3>
<p>
Matt 5:5; Psa 37:11,18-19,29,34; 25:9; Psa 22:26-28; 149:4; Isa 29:19-20;1 Peter 3:4,9-12; Eph 5:5-7; Acts 20:32; Acts 26:18; Matt 19:29; 1 Peter 1:3-5.</p>
<p>
The meek are humble, submissive, unresisting, unruffled under provocation, and the Lord has promised to guide, teach and bless such with abundance. If you really want the blessings of the Lord in your life and the inheritance He has promised to His own children, then, first receive grace to be humble, submissive and meek. The meek, the one that has the quality of character of Christ will be <dr class="alt5">tender hearted, be courteous; not returning evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing, knowing that you were called to this, that you may inherit a blessing.” (1 Peter 3:8-9)</dr class="alt5"> And <dr class="alt5">“the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and His ears are open to their prayers”. (1 Peter 3:12)</dr class="alt5"> May God make us meek and may the meekness of Christ be reproduced in our character and nature. Then the promises of the Lord will be fulfilled in our lives. </p>
<p>
Remember, “blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.” </p>
