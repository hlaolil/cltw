 <h1>
The Spirit of Truth
</h1>
<p>
Whenever Jesus Christ is exalted the Third Person of the Trinity is at 

work. The Bible emphasises different activities for each of the three 

members of the Godhead. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of truth and He 

always points us in the direction of the way, and the truth, and the 

life.</p>
<p>
Jesus told His disciples, <font color= "blue">“And I will pray the Father, 

and He will give you another Helper, that He may abide with you forever— 

the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees 

Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He dwells with you and will be in 

you.” (John 14:16-17)</font>.</p>
<p>

It is through the person and work of Jesus Christ that <font color= "blue">you 

shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.” (John 

8:32)</font>.</p>
<p> Jesus said to him, <font color= "blue">“I am the way, the 

truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me” (John 

14:6)</font>. </p>
<p>A couple of verses later He said to Philip, <font color= 

"blue">“He who has seen Me has seen the Father” (John 14:9)</font>.</p>
<p>
Moreover, the Holy Spirit is the “Spirit of truth.” He is the Spirit of 

Christ who is the truth. He exalts the truth and glorifies Christ.
<h3>
Guiding us into the truth
</h3>
<p>
The Holy Spirit does not speak of Himself, but always of Jesus. Anything 

that detracts from the person and work of Jesus Christ is not the activity 

of the Holy Spirit. He will never pre-empt the place of Christ in our 

thinking.<br> He will always exalt our Lord. He comes along side us to guide us 

into the truth about God the Father and the Son.</p>
<p>
The “Spirit of truth” opens our blind eyes so the unregenerate heart can 

see the truth. He clears the cloudy mind so that it can understand the 

truth. <br>He prods the stubborn will so that it responds in full commitment to 

the truth.</p>
<p>
Can a person by searching find out God? The answer is no because he is dead 

in trespasses and sins, and blind spiritually. God takes the initiative. <br>

God has chosen to reveal Himself in the person of Jesus Christ, and the 

Spirit of truth accurately retained and revealed that true revelation from 

God in the God-breathed Scriptures.<br> The Spirit of God, the Spirit of truth, 

guided over the preservation of His revelation in the Bible. Without such 

special self-revelation of God to men guided along by the Holy Spirit we 

would know absolutely nothing about God’s moral attributes.</p>
<h3>
Revelation of the Truth by the Holy Spirit
</h3>
<p>
The Spirit of truth “breathed the breath of God” into His Book and made it 

the Book of truth (2 Peter 1:20-21; 2 Tim 3:16-17).

The Holy Spirit of truth reveals the truth about God, man, sin, judgement, 

atonement, salvation, eternal life, etc. This special revelation is the 

work of the Spirit of truth.<br> Without this special revelation we are 

helpless in knowing God.</p>
<p>

The Spirit of truth will reveal nothing but the truth about God.<br> He never 

contradicts revealed truth in His Word, the Bible. After forty years of 

scholarly study of His Word I have yet to find a contradiction in the 

Bible. <br>It contradicts human reason and that is the problem. It always 

proves God to be true and every man a liar.</p>
<p>

The supreme ministry of the Holy Spirit is to reveal the Father and the 

Son. <br>He reveals God in all His glory as the only one living and true God. <br>

He reveals in His Word the great mystery of the Godhead, the three in One—

the Father, the Son of God and the Holy Spirit who are the same in 

substance, equal in power and glory.</p>

<p>
He is the Agent of the Godhead who reveals what God is like in His saving 

grace.</p>
<h3>
The Holy Spirit reveals God in Jesus Christ
</h3>
<p>
The Holy Spirit guides us in the realisation that it is in Jesus Christ 

that God the Father is seen and known (John 1:18). The Holy Spirit 

glorifies the Son so that we may know the Father. He reveals to us the 

Father in the Son.<br> The Spirit of truth reveals to every seeker of the truth 

the fact that: <br> <font color= "blue">Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name. (John 20:31)</font><br> He prepares our minds to accept this 

truth.</p>
<h3>
The Holy Spirit leads us to Jesus Christ
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“When the Helper comes comes . . . He will testify about Me” (John 15:26).</font> </p>
<p><font color= "blue">“I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth;” (John 16:12-13)</font>.</p>
<p>
The Spirit of truth teaches us about the Lord Jesus in the Scriptures.</p>
<p>
The Holy Spirit glorifies Jesus Christ by drawing sinners to Him for 

forgiveness. He causes us to be born again.</p>
<p>
The Holy Spirit works in the life of the Christian by reproducing Christ-

likeness in us. He intercedes on our behalf within our hearts, as Christ 

intercedes on our behalf before the Father in heaven (Rom 8:26,33-34).</p>
<p>
The Spirit of truth leads and guides us into a deeper understanding of the 

person and work of Jesus Christ so that we can be better witness of 

Him.</p>
