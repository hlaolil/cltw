Lost or Wasted Time
</h1>
<p>
Numbering our days would include evaluating the use and management of our time. This means evaluating where and how we spend our days. <br>If we are too busy to spend time in the Word, then we need to ask ourselves why.Let me suggest four reasons why people are too busy, but are going nowhere in terms of eternal investments, or in accomplishing God’s will.</p>
<p>
(1) People may stay busy because of their egos. People want to appear important. In our society, the crowded schedule, the incredible number of hours and heavy demands are supposed to show how successful or important a person is. Somehow we have come to gauge people, including ourselves, by activity and performance, so we overload our schedules.</p>
<p>
(2) People may stay busy as a cover up for laziness. Running around in a lot of extracurricular activities is sometimes a way to avoid the more important or difficult responsibilities.<br> This is particularly true for pastors. Some would rather be busy with all kinds of things rather than spend many hard hours working and thinking through the Word or a text of Scripture. If a Pastor doesn’t take the time to study and know the Word, how can he lead people to the quiet and still waters of God’s Word? The same principle applies to all of us.</p>
<p>
(3) People may stay busy because of greed. People are greedy or materialistic. Matthew 6 is a classic commentary on this problem. People are busy, busy, busy because they have up-side-down priorities and they are never satisfied; enough is never enough. As a result, they pursue the details of life from morning to evening. If they make R70,000 this year, next year they figure with just a little more work, they might make R90,000. Greed for money is only one aspect. This can also involve greed for power, praise, prestige, position, possessions, and security.</p>
<p>
(4) People may stay busy because they are more concerned about pleasing men rather than God. They have never learned to say “no” which is important to our ability to keep God’s priorities before us. <br>If we do not plan our schedules and decide what we should and should not do, others will decide for us. Our business will be a form of betrayal rather than commitment. <br>A good illustration of this seen in Acts 6. When confronted with how to meet the needs of the people, they first approached the problem by establishing priorities according to biblical principles. They said, <dr class="alt5">“It is not desirable that we should leave the word of God and serve tables. Therefore, brethren, seek out from among you seven men of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.” (Acts 6:1-7)</dr class="alt5"> <br>Instead of adding this job to their present responsibilities, they delegated the task to others. Biblical priorities and God’s will for us individually must determine our activities rather than the wants or even the needs of people.</p>
<p>
Numbering our days also means evaluating the quality of our time spent.<br> The amount of time we spend at something is often not as important as the quality of the time spent. Not only must we consider where our time goes, but how we spend it and why.<br> By how I mean how well. Is it quality time? Do you take time for God’s Word and other projects which require solid thinking and alertness when you are not tired, or when you are at your best?<br> When you spend time with your family, is your mind and heart somewhere else? Are you distracted? <br>When in church, for instance, what exactly are you thinking about?</p>
<p>
The why is also very important. We need to consider our motives and goals in the use of time. As believers we need goals and a plan. All we do should be structured around fulfilling biblical goals.<br> We need <br>(a) objectives (immediate, short-range), <br>(b) goals (intermediate), and <br>(c) a mission (long range). <br>Then everything we do in the use of our time should be structured around that. This includes rest, recreation, relaxation, fun, as well as our work, service, and ministry.</p>
<p>
Some of the greatest thinkers and inventors have been people who took short naps (catnaps). Why? Because it helped them to think and use their time more effectively. <br>They were goal oriented.<br> <dr class="alt5">Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God. (1 Cor. 10:31)</dr class="alt5">.</p>
