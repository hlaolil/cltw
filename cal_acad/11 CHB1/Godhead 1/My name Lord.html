   <h1>Exodus 6:3 &mdash; My name "Lord"</h1>
<p class="blockin">
I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty, but by My name Lord I was not known to them.</p>
<p>
 The patriarchs were privileged to know the God who made the covenant, but for them the covenant was barely fulfilled. The patriarchs knew God as the Maker of the covenant. Moses and the generation of the Exodus would know God as the One who fulfilled the covenant.</p>
<ul><li>
The patriarchs knew the name Yahweh (it is used some 160 times in Genesis); but the great application of the name referred to God who kept and fulfilled the covenant: I have also established My covenant with them. “The patriarchs had only the promises, not the things promised.” </li></ul>
<blockquote><p class="crb">
<b>As God Almighty</b>: In addition, though the patriarchs knew God Almighty (El Shaddai), they did not know Him as extensively and intimately as He would reveal Himself to Moses and his generation. They knew the power of God, but didn’t have the same personal relationship and revelation Moses would come to know.</p></blockquote>
<ul><li>
For us, God wants to be more than God Almighty - He wants us also to know Him as a personal, promise making and promise keeping God, whom we can trust in everything. Believers should ask themselves if they really know God by such names.</li>
<li>
“The supreme need in every hour of difficulty and depression is a vision of God. To see Him is to see all else in proper proportion and perspective.”</li></ul>
  <h6>Note:</h6>
  <p class="note">
  See Genesis 17:1 for the revelation of this name to Abraham, and Genesis 35:11 for its repetition to Jacob. 
  <p>
 We do not find the full name used by God in any appearance to Isaac; but Isaac himself uses it in Genesis 28:3. By My name Jehovah was I not known unto them. The explanation of this passage is by no means easy. God himself, according to Genesis 15:7, revealed Himself to Abraham as Jehovah before declaring His name to be El-Shaddai (God Almighty); and again revealed Himself to Jacob as Jehovah-Elohim (Genesis 28:13). Abraham named the place where he had been about to sacrifice Isaac, "Jehovah-jireh" (Genesis 22:14). 
  <p>
That Moses regarded the name as known even earlier, appears from Genesis 4:1. It was probably as old as language. The apparent meaning of the present passage cannot therefore be its true meaning. No writer would so contradict himself. Perhaps the true sense is, <b class=alt3>"I was known to them as a Being of Might and Power, not as mere absolute (and so eternal and immutable) existence."</b></p>
