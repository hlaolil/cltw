   <h1>Genesis 1:1  In the beginning</h1>
<p class="blockin">
In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</p>
<p>
"In the beginning God..." The Scriptures don't try to prove the existence of God. They begin with the truth that everyone knows there is a God. This is exactly the point of Ro 1:18-20. There is an intuitive knowledge of God on the inside of every single person who has ever lived. We shouldn't argue with anyone about His existence. We just go past their heads to their hearts and touch the part of them that knows there is a God.</p>
<p>
God is called the Alpha and Omega, because He is the first and the last. (Alpha is the first letter of the Greek alphabet and Omega the last). He existed before anything else. He created everything else that exists. Some sci-fi fanatics try to present God as nothing but a superior alien, but that's not what this scripture says. God doesn't just have superior intellect and know how to use natural law more than we do. He is the Creator, not manipulator of nature.</p>
