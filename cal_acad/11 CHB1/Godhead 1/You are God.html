Psalms 90:2 &mdash; You are God</h1>
<h5>
Before the mountains were brought forth, Or ever You had formed the earth and the world, Even from everlasting to everlasting, You are God.</h5>
<p>
<strong>Before the mountains were brought forth</strong>. Moses intends to set forth some high and hidden mystery, and yet he seems to speak feebly, and, as it were, in a childish manner. For who does not know that God existed before the world? This we grant is a truth which all men admit; but we will scarcely find one in a hundred who is thoroughly persuaded that God remains unchangeably the same. God is here contrasted with created beings, who, as all know, are subject to continual changes, so that there is nothing stable under heaven. As, in a particular manner, nothing is fuller of vicissitude than human life, that men may not judge of the nature of God by their own fluctuating condition, He is here placed in a state of settled and undisturbed tranquillity. </p>
<p>
Thus the everlastingness of which Moses speaks is to be referred not only to the essence of God, but also to His providence, by which He governs the world. Although He subjects the world to many alterations, He remains unmoved; and that not only in regard to Himself, but also in regard to the faithful, who find from experience, that instead of being wavering, He is steadfast in His power, truth, righteousness, and goodness, even as He has been from the beginning. This eternal and unchangeable steadfastness of God could not be perceived prior to the creation of the world, since there were as yet no eyes to be witnesses of it. But it may be gathered a posteriori; for while all things are subject to revolution and incessant vicissitude, His nature continues always the same.</p>
<p>
There may be also here a contrast between Him and all the false gods of the heathen, who have, by little and little, crept into the world in such vast numbers, through the error and folly of men. But I have already shown the object which Moses has in view, which is, that we mistake if we measure God by our own understanding; and that we must mount above the earth, yes, even above heaven itself, whenever we think upon Him.</p>
<p>
In the description of the creation it would be natural to represent the mountains as the first objects that appeared, as emerging from the waters; and, therefore, as the "first" or "most ancient" of created objects. The phrase, therefore, is equivalent to saying, Before the earth was created. The literal meaning of the expression, "were brought forth," is, in the Hebrew, "were born." The mountains are mentioned as the most ancient things in creation, in Deuteronomy 33:15. Compare Genesis 49:26; Habakkuk 3:6.</p>
<p>
<strong>Or ever You had formed</strong> - literally, "had brought forth." Compare Job 39:1.
The earth and the world - The word "earth" here is used to denote the world as distinguished either from heaven Genesis 1:1, or from the sea Genesis 1:10. The term "world" in the original is commonly employed to denote the earth considered as "inhabited," or as capable of being inhabited - a dwelling place for living beings.</p>
<p>
<strong>Even from everlasting to everlasting</strong> - From duration stretching backward without limit to duration stretching forward without limit; that is, from eternal ages to eternal ages; or, forever.</p>
<p>
<strong>You are God - Or, "Thou, O God."</strong> The idea is, that He was always, and ever will be, God: the God; the true God; the only God; the unchangeable God. At any period in the past, during the existence of the earth, or the heavens, or before either was formed, He existed, with all the attributes essential to Deity; at any period in the future - during the existence of the earth and the heavens, or beyond - far as the mind can reach into the future, and even beyond that - He will still exist unchanged, with all the attributes of Deity. The creation of the universe made no change in Him; its destruction would not vary the mode of His existence, or make Him in any respect a different being. There could not be a more absolute and unambiguous declaration, as there could not be one more sublime, of the eternity of God. The mind cannot take in a grander thought than that there is one eternal and immutable Being.</p>
