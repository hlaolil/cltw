   <h1>Exodus 3:2 &mdash; God is, He Changes Not</h1>
<p class="blockin">
And the Angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire from the midst of a bush. So he looked, and behold, the bush was burning with fire, but the bush [was] not consumed.</p>
<p>
 And the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him, Not a created angel, but the Angel of God's presence and covenant, the eternal Word and Son of God; since he is afterwards expressly called Jehovah, and calls himself the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, which a created angel would never do: the appearance was, in a flame of fire, out of the midst of a bush; not in a tall, lofty, spreading oak or cedar, but in a low thorny bramble bush, which it might have been thought would have been consumed in an instant of time: and he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush [was] not consumed; this was not imaginary, but a real thing; there was such a bush, and Jehovah appeared in it in this way, and though it was all on fire yet was not consumed, but remained whole after burning: </p>
<p>
God revealed Himself to Moses as a bush that was on fire but not burning up. Just like in Moses day, the presence of the Lord is a fire that refreshes and purifies. As we become a people who seek the presence of the Lord we become a curious sight to those around us – a people who burn with zeal but don’t burn out.</p>  
<p>
Jews commonly interpret it of the people of Israel, in the furnace of affliction in Egypt, and yet not consumed; in fact, the more they were afflicted the more they grew; and it may be a symbol of the church and people of God, in all ages, under affliction and distress: they are like a thorn bush both for their small quantity, being few, and for their quality, in themselves weak and strength-less, mean and low; have about them the thorns of corruptions and temptations, and who are often in the fire of afflictions and persecutions, yet are not consumed; which is owing to the person, presence, power, and grace of Christ being among them.</p>
