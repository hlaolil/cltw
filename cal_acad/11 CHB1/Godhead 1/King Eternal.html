   <h1>1 Timothy 1:17 &mdash; King Eternal</h1>
<h5>
Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</h5>
<p>
Paul broke out in praise to God for saving him. This happened often in Paul's writings. Other instances include the following:</p>
<ul>
	<li>1Ti 6:16 - "Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting. Amen."</li>
	<li>Ro 11:36 - "For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen."</li>
	<li>Ro 16:27 - "To God only wise, be glory through Jesus Christ for ever. Amen."</li>
	<li>Ga 1:4-5 - "Who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us from this present evil world, according to the will of God and our Father: To whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen."</li>
	<li>Eph 3:21 - "Unto him be glory in the church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen."</li>
	<li>Php 4:20 - "Now unto God and our Father be glory for ever and ever. Amen."</li>
	<li>2Ti 4:18 - "And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen."</li>
</ul>
<p>
Paul's praise in this verse describes some of the attributes of God. Entire books have been written on each one of these characteristics. Most of these descriptions are beyond our finite ability to comprehend completely. Here is a very brief mention of each.</p>
<p>
<strong>King</strong> - Supreme in power and authority, Jesus is King of everyone by right of creation and also conquest. Kings levy laws and enforce them. There is a reckoning and punishment for breaking those laws. The glory associated with our King is infinitely greater than the pomp and circumstance of any earthly king, yet our King came to this earth to serve instead of be served. Jesus said that He was meek and lowly in heart (Mt 11:29). He is King of kings (Re 17:14 and 19:16).</p>
<p>
<strong>Eternal</strong> - We can't totally comprehend this, but we can accept it. Jesus as God had no beginning and will never have an end. He will not only continue to exist, but He will exist without any loss of any of His powers or attributes.</p>
<p>
<strong>Immortal</strong> - This means non-mortal, or not subject to death, but it includes much more than just physical death. It refers to everything that accompanies death; i.e., all the consequences of sin. Jesus is not bound by any of the limitations of our mortality.</p>
<p>
The Scriptures declare that only God is immortal (1Ti 6:16) and has brought the possibility of immortality and life to human beings through the Gospel (2Ti 1:10). In the resurrection, believers in Christ will be clothed with immortality (1Co 15:42, 50, and 52-54).</p>
<p>
<strong>Invisible</strong> - God can and has been seen, but not in His totality. No person can see God face to face and remain mortal.</p>
<p>
<strong>Only wise God</strong> - Jesus is God. He's the only God. He's the only wise God. "There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the LORD" (Pr 21:30). 1Jo 3:20 states that God knows all things. "His understanding is infinite" (Ps 147:5).</p>
<p>
God never went to school to learn or to be taught. If He was taught, that would mean that whoever taught Him would be God, because the teacher would have more knowledge than God. Isa 40:13-14 states, "Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his counsellor hath taught him? With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and shewed to him the way of understanding?" The answer to that question is no one taught Him. The God who knows all needs no teacher.</p>
<p>
God knows everything possible and everything actual. He knows what our lives would have been like if we had made other choices. Isa 48:18 says, "O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea." God, in speaking to Moses, said, "And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand" (Ex 3:19). This shows the intimate knowledge of God as to what we will do. God knows what our lives will be, and what they could have been, if only we had acted and decided differently.</p>
<p class="crb">
We must agree with David when he said, "Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it". &mdash; <strong>Ps 139:6</strong></p>
<h3>
Paul’s praise to the God who saved him.</h3>
<p>
<strong>Now to the King eternal</strong>: Paul could not think of how bad he was, and how great the salvation of God was, and how great the love of God was, without simply breaking into spontaneous praise.</p>
<p>
<strong>The King eternal, immortal, invisible, to God who alone is wise</strong>: This outburst of praise shows that Paul both knew God and that he loved God.</p>
 <ul>
<li>He knew God to be the King eternal, ruling and reigning in complete power and glory.</li>
<li>He knew God to be immortal, existing before anything else existed, and being the Creator of all things.</li>
<li>He knew God to be invisible, not completely knowable by us; we can’t completely figure out God, or know all His secrets.</li>
<li>He knew God alone is wise, that He is God - and we are not. We think our plans and insights are so important, but only God really knows and understands all things.</li></ul>
 <p>
<strong>Be honour and glory forever and ever</strong>: Knowing all this about God, Paul couldn’t stop praising Him. If we ever have trouble worshipping God, it is because we don’t know Him very well.</p>
 <ul>
<li>This description of God gave Timothy still another reason to remain in Ephesus. He could and should stay there when he considered the greatness of the God who he served. This great God is worthy of His service and can empower his service in Ephesus.</li></ul>
