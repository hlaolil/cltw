Job 23:13 &mdash; God is Unique</h1>
<p>
<h5>“But He is unique (in one mind), and who can make Him change? And whatever His soul desires, that He does."</h5>
<p>
But He is unique, and who can make Him change? Job here argued back with himself against his previous great declaration of faith. He understood though he did deeply and sincerely trust in God, at the same time he could not make God do anything.</p>
<h5>
Job said, ‘He (God) is the unique (one).’ The Hebrew expression is rare in the OT but idiomatic.”</h5> 
<p class="crb">
The older King James Version translates who can make Him change as who can turn Him? “But oh! The text itself is music to my ears. It seems to sound like the martial trumpet of the battle, and my soul is ready for the fray. It seems now that if trials and troubles should come, if I could but hold my hand upon this precious text, I would laugh at them all. ‘Who can turn him?’ — I would shout — ‘Who can turn him?’ Come on, earth and hell, come on, for ‘who can turn him?’” (Spurgeon) </p>
<p>
<strong>But He is in one mind</strong> - He is unchangeable. He has formed his plans, and no one can divert Him from them. Of the truth of this sentiment there can be no dispute. The idea seems to be, that God was now accomplishing His eternal purposes in respect to him; that He had formed a plan far back in eternal ages, and that that plan must be executed; that He was a Sovereign, and that however mysterious His plans might be, it was vain to contend with them, and that man ought to submit to their execution with patience and resignation. Job expected yet that God would come forth and vindicate him; but at present all that he could do was to submit. He did not pretend to understand the reason of the divine dispensations; he felt that he had no power to resist God. The language here is that of a man who is perplexed in regard to the divine dealings, but who feels that they are all in accordance with the unchangeable purpose of God.</p>
<p>
<strong>And what His soul desires, that He does</strong> - He does what He pleases. None can resist or control Him. It is vain, therefore, to contend against Him. From this passage we see that the doctrine of divine sovereignty was understood at a very early age of the world, and entered undoubtedly into the religion of the patriarchs. It was then seen and felt that God was absolute; that He was not dependent on His creatures; that He acted according to a plan; that He was inflexible in regard to that plan, and that it was in vain to attempt to resist its execution. It is, when properly understood, a matter of unspeakable consolation that God has a plan - for who could honour a God who had "no" plan, but who did everything by haphazard? It is matter of rejoicing that He has "one" great purpose which extends through all ages, and which embraces all things - for then everything falls into its proper place, and has its appropriate bearing on other events. It is a matter of joy that God "does" execute all His purposes; for as they are all good and wise, it is "desirable" that they should be executed. It would be a calamity if a good plan were not executed. Why then should people complain at the purposes or the decrees of God?</p>
