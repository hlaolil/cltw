<h1>Lord of lords, the great God</h1>
<p class="blockin">
<b>Deuteronomy 10:17</b> For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who shows no partiality nor takes a bribe. </p>
<p>
<b>Shows no partiality</b> - Whether Jews or Gentiles, but deals justly and equally with all sorts of men; and as whosoever fears and obeys Him shall be accepted, so all incorrigible transgressors shall be severely punished, and you no less than other people: therefore do not flatter yourselves as if God would bear with your sins because of His particular kindness to you or to your fathers.</p>
<h3>God is "Big"</h3>
<p>
How big is your God?  I mean your vision, your impression, your feeling, your notion of God?  Have you ever stopped to think of all the adjectives that are used to describe Him in the Bible?  Words like Mighty, Awesome, Majestic, Everlasting, Powerful, Supreme, Most High, Beautiful, Great, Marvelous, Zealous, Worthy, Unequalled ... He is ALL those things!</p>
<p>
Have you ever stopped to contemplate each of these characteristics of God, our Father?  I confess that I have been all too guilty of forming a neat little picture of Him on His throne in Heaven; He listens to my prayers and holds the world in His hands.  I am able to focus on each of these qualities one at a time, but I am realizing that by doing so, I am limiting my understanding of Him.  He is so much more! As I begin to study his attributes and see evidence of each of these characteristics of God, my impression is expanding.</p>
<p>
As I concentrate on His Power, I see Him as the One who created the Heavens and the Earth out of nothing; and as the Holy Being who commands hosts of heavenly angels as well as the affairs of all men, great and small, on Earth.  And I see Him as the Authority who has dominion over Satan and all evil.  And when I look upon His Zealousness, I see that He wants to reconcile with all of His creation, and He is intense in His pursuit of every soul for His Name's sake.  His Majesty is reflected in His holiness, His grace, His mercy and His love; all of which is superior to anything we can accomplish.</p>
<h3>ALL that He is</h3>
<p>
But the point I want to make is this:  If I hope to ever come close to knowing HOW BIG my God is, I must focus on ALL that He is.  If I just look upon one attribute my "vision field", so to speak, is limited.   And He is Unlimited!  But as I build on my awareness and knowledge, by adding one characteristic to another, and then that impression to another; my finite picture begins to expand and the fullness of God comes into view.  </p>
<p>
And in case you think that makes Him too big; and therefore unrecognizable or too distant, let me share His amazing answer to our dilemma.  It is His Son, Jesus!  We are able to enter into that close relationship, and see all that our Father is, because He is perfectly displayed in the love, wisdom, power, justice and holiness of Jesus Christ.  Remember that Jesus said, "If you have really known me, you will know my Father."</p>
<p>
So I am determined to know Jesus more, and make my God as big as I am humanly capable.  I know that it will still not do Him justice, but I want Him to be my focus in life.  Because I know that when I limit God, and make Him small, it becomes all about me.  And there's nothing Awesome, Majestic or Beautiful about that!</p>
