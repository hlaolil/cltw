<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
 <p class="blockin">
<b> Psa 148:13</b> "Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is excellent; his glory [is] above the earth and heaven."</p>

<p>In the Old Testament times, a name was not only identification, but an identity as well. Many times a special meaning was attached to the name. Names had, among other purposes, an explanatory purpose (e.g., Nabal, whose name means "fool," is the target of Abigail's explanation to David: "For as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him:" - 1Sa 25:25). Throughout Scripture God reveals Himself to us through His names. When we study these names that He reveals to us in the Bible, we will better understand who God really is. The meanings behind God's names reveal the central personality and nature of the One who bears them.</p>

<h3>Who is God to you?</h3>

<p>Is He your Most High God, All sufficient One, Master, Lord of Peace, the Lord Who Will Provide? Is He your Father? We must be careful not to make God into an "it" or a "thing" to which we pray. He is our Jehovah Raah, the Lord our Shepherd. God knows us by our name, shouldn't we know Him by His?</p>

<h3>Hallowed be Your name?</h3>

<p>To hallow a thing is to make it holy or to set it apart to be exalted as being worthy of absolute devotion. To hallow the name of God is to regard Him with complete devotion and loving admiration. God's name is of the utmost importance (Neh 9:5); therefore we ought reserve it a position of grave significance in our minds and hearts. We should never take His name lightly (Exd 20:7; Lev 22:32), but always rejoice in it and think deeply upon its true meaning.</p>

<h2>El Shaddai (Lord God Almighty)</h2>

<p class="crb">(el shad-di') All-Sufficient One, Lord God Almighty</p>
<p><b>Use in the Bible</b>: In the Old Testament El Shaddai occurs 7 times. El Shaddai is first used in Gen 17:1.</p>

<p><b>Strong's Reference</b>: H7706</p>

<p><b>El Shaddai in the Septuagint</b>: theou saddai - God Shaddai; pantokratôr (for Shaddai) - the Almighty</p>

<p><b>Meaning and Derivation</b>: El is another name that is translated as "God" and can be used in conjunction with other words to designate various aspects of God's character. Another word much like Shaddai, and from which many believe it derived, is shad meaning "breast" in Hebrew (some other scholars believe that the name is derived from an Akkadian word Šadu, meaning "mountain," suggesting strength and power). This refers to God completely nourishing, satisfying, and supplying His people with all their needs as a mother would her child. Connected with the word for God, El, this denotes a God who freely gives nourishment and blessing, He is our sustainer.</p>
<p>
<b>Further references of the name El Shaddai in the Old Testament</b>: Gen 17:1; Gen 28:3; Gen 35:11; Gen 43:14; Gen 48:3</p>

<h2>EL ELYON (The Most High God)</h2>
<p class="crb">(el el-yone') The Most High God</p>
<p><b>Use in the Bible</b>: In the Old Testament El Elyon occurs 28 times. It occurs 19 times in Psalms. El Elyon is first used in Gen 14:18.</p>

<p><b>Strong's Reference</b>: H5945</p>

<p><b>El Elyon in the Septuagint</b>: ho theos ho hupsistos - the God most high</p>

<p><b>Meaning and Derivation</b>: El is another name that is translated as "God" and can be used in conjunction with other words to designate various aspects of God's character. Elyon literally means "Most High" and is used both adjectivally and substantivally throughout the Old Testament. It expresses the extreme sovereignty and majesty of God and His highest preeminence. When the two words are combined - El Elyon - it can be translated as "the most exalted God."(Psa 57:2)</p>
<p>
<b>Further references of the name El Elyon in the Old Testament</b>: Gen 14:18; Gen 14:19; Gen 14:20; Gen 14:22; Psa 57:2; Psa 78:35</p>

<h2>ADONAI (Lord, Master)</h2>
<p class="crb">(ad-o-noy') Lord, Master</p>
<p>
<b>Use in the Bible</b>: In the Old Testament Adonai occurs 434 times. There are heavy uses of Adonai in Isaiah (e.g., Adonai Jehovah). It occurs 200 times in Ezekiel alone and appears 11 times in Daniel Chapter 9. Adonai is first used in Gen 15:2.</p>
<p>
<b>Strong's Reference</b>: H136</p>
<p>
<b>Adonai in the Septuagint</b>: kurios - Lord, Master</p>
<p>
<b>Meaning and Derivation</b>: Adonai is the verbal parallel to Yahweh and Jehovah. Adonai is plural; the singular is adon. In reference to God the plural Adonai is used. When the singular adon is used, it usually refers to a human lord. Adon is used 215 times to refer to men. Occasionally in Scripture and predominantly in the Psalms, the singular adon is used to refer to God as well (cf. Exd 34:23). To avoid contravening the commandment "Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain" (Exd 20:7), sometimes Adonai was used as a substitute for Yahweh (YHWH). Adonai can be translated literally as, "my lords' " (both plural and possessive).</p>


<h2>YAHWEH (Lord, Jehovah)</h2>
<p class="crb">(yah-weh) Lord, Jehovah</p>
<p><b>Use in the Bible</b>: In the Old Testament Yahweh occurs 6,519 times. This name is used more than any other name of God. Yahweh is first used in Gen 2:4.</p>
<p>
<b>Variant spellings</b>: YHWH, Jehovah</p>
<p>
<b>Strong's Reference: H3068</b></p>

<p><b>Yahwehin the Septuagint</b>: kurios - Lord, Master, 
despotês - Lord, Master, denoting the omnipotence of God (TDNT), despot, absolute ruler</p>
<p>
<b>Meaning and Derivation</b>: Yahweh is the promised name of God. This name of God which (by Jewish tradition) is too holy to voice, is actually spelled "YHWH" without vowels. YHWH is referred to as the Tetragrammaton (which simply means "the four letters"). YHWH comes from the Hebrew letters: Yud, Hay, Vav, Hay. While YHWH is first used in Genesis 2, God did not reveal Himself as YHWH until Exodus 3. The modern spelling as "Yahweh" includes vowels to assist in pronunciation. Many pronounce YHWH as "Yahweh" or "Jehovah." We no longer know for certain the exact pronunciation. During the third century A.D., the Jewish people stopped saying this name in fear of contravening the commandment "Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain" (Exd 20:7). As a result of this, Adonai is occasionally a substitute for YHWH. The following compound names which start with "YHWH" have been shown using "Jehovah." This is due to the common usage of "Jehovah" in the English of these compound names in the early English translations of the Bible (e.g., the Geneva Bible, the King James Version, etc.).</p>

<h2>JEHOVAH NISSI (The Lord My Banner)</h2>
<p class="crb">(yeh-ho-vaw' nis-see') The Lord My Banner, The Lord My Miracle</p>
<p>
<b>Use in the Bible</b>: In the Old Testament Jehovah-Nissi occurs only once in Exd 17:15.</p>
<p>
<b>Variant spellings</b>: Jehovah Nisi; Jehovahnissi</p>
<p>
<b>Strong's Reference</b>: H3071</p>
<p>
<b>Jehovah Nissi in the Septuagint</b>: kurios kataphugê mou - the Lord is my refuge</p>
<p>
<b>Meaning and Derivation</b>: Jehovah is translated as "The Existing One" or "Lord." The chief meaning of Jehovah is derived from the Hebrew word Havah meaning "to be" or "to exist." It also suggests "to become" or specifically "to become known" - this denotes a God who reveals Himself unceasingly. Nes (nês), from which Nissi derived, means "banner" in Hebrew. In Exd 17:15, Moses, recognizing that the Lord was Israel's banner under which they defeated the Amalekites, builds an altar named Jehovah-Nissi (the Lord our Banner). Nes is sometimes translated as a pole with an insignia attached. In battle opposing nations would fly their own flag on a pole at each of their respective front lines. This was to give their soldiers a feeling of hope and a focal point. This is what God is to us: a banner of encouragement to give us hope and a focal point.</p>
<p>

<h2>JEHOVAH-RAAH (The Lord My Shepherd)</h2>

A shepherd is one who feeds or leads his flock to pasture (Eze 34:11-15). An extend translation of this word, rea', is "friend" or "companion." This indicates the intimacy God desires between Himself and His people. When the two words are combined - Jehovah Raah - it can be translated as "The Lord my Friend."</p>
