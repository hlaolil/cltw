<h1>Psalm 139:7 &mdash; Where can I go?</h1>
<h5>
Where can I go from Your Spirit? Or where can I flee from Your presence?</h5>
<p>
The psalmist does not really want to flee. He is posing ideas and questions so that we can see that wherever we are, we are always under God's scrutiny. God is a positive spirit. Everything that He creates has positive function and beauty. His intention in everything for us is always positive, right, and good. He does everything in love and concern for our well-being so that we will fit within His purpose, and it will be worked out in our lives. Psalms 139 contains no negative connotations.</p>
<p>
From this, because His mind permeates the entirety of His creation, we ought to derive great confidence that God is always with us. He is omnipotent. He is omnipresent. He is actively using His powers, His Spirit, to govern and manage His creation.</p>
<p>
The beginning of the source of all power is in the mind. Remember, man is in God's image. A man may make tools to intensify his powers, but the real power is in the mind because without it, he would not be able to create the tool that expands his powers.</p>
<p>
God's Holy Spirit is the essence of His mind. Just like a man, His power resides there too, only He does not have to use steam shovels and power tools to get things done. He speaks, and the laws He has created go to work. The tool by which He carries everything out is His Spirit, the essence of His mind.</p>
<p>
Beginning in this verse and continuing through verse 12, David wrote about God’s omnipresence. No one can escape the presence of God because this universe is His; He created it, and He controls it. God is immanent; there is no place that He is not present. This verse is one of only a few in the entire Old Testament that specifically mentions “Holy Spirit” (the others are Ps. 51:10 and Isa. 63:10–11). The term “Spirit of God,” however, appears many times in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>
David wrote that God’s Spirit brings the presence of God to every part of His created order. God’s Spirit is not a creation of God, but is the very manifest and divine presence of God. The Holy Spirit of God is God’s presence in the world that is aware of everything that occurs in the world; we cannot escape it.</p>
