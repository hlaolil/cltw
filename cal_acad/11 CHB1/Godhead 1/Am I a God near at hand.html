Jeremiah 23:23 <br />&mdash; Am I a God near at hand</h1>
<h5>
“Am I a God near at hand,” says the Lord, “And not a God afar off?</h5>
<p>
Obviously this is a rhetorical question, but a good one.  I think sometimes we think that we only deal with God at church, or maybe even that we can run away from Him to some remote place.  He's there, constantly, in a very real way.  I think we go to church for ourselves in a lot of ways... so that we can remember Him, so that we can learn how to worship and get some information, and take the sacrament, which is really important... but it isn't someplace we go so that we can interact with God... because He is there ALL the time... and we should be interacting with Him in our daily lives... finding a way to merge our church personalities with our work and school personalities, etc.  Finding ways to be whole... as God is.  And also... I think we need to remember that God isn't just God for us... but for *everyone* we come into contact with, or see on the news, or anywhere there is... and that we need to respect those people as family... and not criticise and judge them like they are outsiders of some secret club... God is their Father as well.</p>
<p>
We can explain "near" as being in heaven; and God sees, and hears, and observes persons and things there, being near unto Him. And He is not a God afar off? that sees, and hears, and takes notice of persons and things at a distance, which is on earth. The meaning is, that He certainly was; and that persons and things on earth were as much under His cognisance and notice, as persons and things in heaven; which was quite contrary to the notions of these atheistic prophets and people; who, like Heathens, thought that God did not concern Himself about persons and things on earth. </p>
<p>
The meaning is, that God is as near in one place as He is in another; which is a very great truth; and a very comfortable one it is to the people of God, to whom He is near in all places, and at all times:</p>
<ul>
	<li>He is a present help in time of trouble</li>
	<li>He is near them, to hear their cries, and grant their requests</li>
	<li>He is near to give them assistance in a time of need, and </li>
	<li>to deliver them out of all their troubles</li>
	<li>to afford them His gracious presence, and </li>
	<li>to indulge them with communion with Himself</li>
	<li>to communicate all good things to them</li>
	<li>to speak comfortably to them</li>
	<li>to take them by the hand, and lead them in the way everlasting</li>
	</ul><br />
<p class="crb">
He is at their right hand to uphold them with His, and to strengthen them with strength in their souls; to advise and counsel, and direct them; to rebuke their enemies, and save them from them that condemn them; and indeed there are no people like them, who have God so nigh unto them, in all things they call upon Him. <strong>Deuteronomy 4:7</strong></p>
<p>
Though He may seem at times to be afar off, and stand at a distance from them; when He hides His face; withdraws His gracious influences; does not appear at once for their relief in distress; but suffers them to be afflicted in one way or another; yet in reality He is not; but is nigh unto them when they call upon Him: and this truth is as uncomfortable and dreadful to wicked men, who cannot go from His spirit, or flee from His presence; which is everywhere, in heaven and hell, in the earth and seas, even in the uttermost parts of them; there His eye is upon them, and His right hand can reach them: He is omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipotent. </p>
<p>
<p>``I God have created the world from the beginning, saith the Lord; and I God will renew the world for the righteous;''
see ( 2 Peter 3:13 ) ; and some interpret the words of time, as well as of place; as if the sense was this, am I a God of late date, as the gods of the Heathens are? no, I am not: am I not a God from eternity who was before the world was, and the Creator of it, which they are not? verily I am: but the former sense is best, and most agreeable with the context, and what follows.</p>
