   <h1>Exodus 3:14 &mdash; I AM WHO I AM</h1>
<p class="blockin">
And God said to Moses, “<strong class="alt3">I AM WHO I AM</b>.” And He said, “Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, ‘I AM has sent me to you.’</p>
<p>
And <b>God</b> said - Two names God would now be known by. A name that speaks what He is in Himself, I am that I am &ndash; This explains His name Jehovah, and signifies: 
<br /><br /><b>First </b>&mdash; That He is self-existent; He has His being of Himself, and has no dependence upon any other. And being self-existent He cannot but be self-sufficient, and therefore all - sufficient, and the inexhaustible fountain of being and bliss. 
<br /><b>Secondly</b> &mdash; That He is eternal and unchangeable, always the same, yesterday today, and for ever: He will be what He will be, and what He is. 
<br /><b>Thirdly</b> &mdash; That He is faithful and true to all His promises, unchangeable in His word as well as in His nature, and not a man that He should lie. Let Israel know this, I am has sent Me to you. <br /><br />A name that speaks what He is to His people. Lest that name I am should puzzle them, He is further directed to make use of another name of God, more familiar.</p>

<h3>God Speaks to Moses</h3>
<p>
<b>And God said to Moses,</b> "I AM WHO I AM." It might seem nonsensical to refer to one's self with the phrase, "I AM WHO I AM." Yet it reveals something important about God - that He has no equal.</p>
<ul><li>
"There is no equivalent for God but God. If you place God on the one side of your symbol of equation (=), there is nothing to put on the other but Himself." (Meyer) </li>
<li>
The closest we come to an equivalent is to say, "God is love" (1 John 4:8, 4:16). Yet that is not exactly an equivalent, because you can't turn it around and say, "Love is God." God is love, but He is also greater than love.</li>
<li>
This name I AM WHO I AM is connected with the name Yahweh. "This pithy clause is clearly a reference to the name YHWH. Probably 'Yahweh' is regarded as a shortening of the whole phrase, and a running together of the clause into one word." (Cole) </li>
<li>
Yahweh was not a new name, nor an unknown name - it appears more than 160 times in the book of Genesis. Moses' mother's name was Jochabed meaning Yahweh is my glory. Moses and Israel knew the name Yahweh. God did not give Moses a previously unknown name of God, but the name they had known before. God called them back to the faith of the patriarchs, not to something "new." </li>
<li>
In the English-speaking world, for a time people pronounced Yahweh as Jehovah. The pious Jews of later years did not want to pronounce the name of God out of reverence, so they left the vowels out of His name and simply said the word Lord (adonai) instead. If the vowels of the word adonai are put over the consonants for YHWH, you can get the name "Jehovah." All this came about much later; in the days of the Bible, the name was pronounced Yah-weh or Yah-veh.</li></ul></p>
 <p>
I AM has sent me to you: God told Moses His name was I AM because God simply is; there was never a time when He did not exist, or a time when He will cease to exist.</p>
 <ul><li>
The name I AM has within it the idea that God is completely independent; that He relies on nothing for life or existence (Isaiah 40:28-29; John 5:26). Theologians sometimes call this quality aseity. It means that God doesn't need anybody or anything - life is in Himself.</li>
<li>
It is also connected with the idea that God is eternal and unchanging. "Strictly speaking, there is no past or future tense in the Divine Vocabulary. When God appears to employ them, it is by way of accommodation to our limited horizons." (Meyer) </li>
<li>
Also inherent in the idea behind the name I AM is the sense that God is "the becoming one"; God becomes whatever is lacking in our time of need. The name I AM invites us to fill in the blank to meet our need - when we are in darkness, Jesus says I am the light; when we are hungry, He says I am the bread of life, when we are defenseless, He says I am the Good Shepherd. God is the becoming one, becoming what we need.</li>
<li>
In this, God's name is both an announcement and an introduction. It announces God's presence, and invites any interested to know Him by experience, to taste and see that the LORD is good.</li></ul>
<p> 
I AM: This is a divine title that Jesus took upon Himself often, clearly identifying Himself with the voice from the burning bush.</p>
 <ul><li>
Therefore I said to you that you will die in your sins; for if you do not believe that I AM [He], you will die in your sins. (John 8:24) </li>
<li>
Then Jesus said to them, "When you lift up the Son of Man, then you will know that I AM [He], and that I do nothing of Myself; but as My Father taught Me, I speak these things." (John 8 :28) </li>
<li>
Jesus said to them, "Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM." (John 8:58) </li>
<li>
Now I tell you before it comes, that when it does come to pass, you may believe that I AM (John 13:19 ) </li>
<li>
Jesus therefore, knowing all things that would come upon Him, went forward and said to them, "Whom are you seeking?" They answered Him, "Jesus of Nazareth." Jesus said to them, "I AM [He]." And Judas, who betrayed Him, also stood with them. Now when He said to them, "I am [He]," they drew back and fell to the ground. (John 18:4-6) </li></ul>
