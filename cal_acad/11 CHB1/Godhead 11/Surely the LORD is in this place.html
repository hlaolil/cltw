   <h1>Surely the LORD is in this place</h1>

<p>
<dr class='alt5'>Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and 

said, "Surely the LORD is in this place; and I did not 

know it." (Genesis 28:16) </dr class='alt5'>
<p>
Do you know the story of Jacob? He was the youngest of 

the twin sons of Isaac. When he was born, he came out 

hand first, it was grasping to his brother’s heal. The 

whole of his early life, would be one of grasping, and 

tension. In many ways, he was a very modern man, (not 

that this is necessarily good) for whatever Jacob 

wanted, he tried to grasp and take for himself. And so 

it came to pass, that one day he found a way to grasp 

his brother’s birth right, and he tricked his brother 

into trading this blessing for a bowl of soup. Then he 

tricked his father into giving him the blessing. For 

Isaac was old, and he could not see and was tricked into 

giving Jacob the blessing. At this point it seemed good 

to Isaac that Jacob should leave for a while, so that 

there would not be any quarrelling and bickering, or any 

revenge. So Jacob is sent off to his uncles house to 

find a wife.</p>
<h3>
God finds you
</h3>
<p>
Now Jacob had known that God had been with his father, 

and so when he was sent away, it was as though he was 

being sent away from God. Sin is like that, it separates 

us from God, and to this day, no one likes that feeling 

of separation. The problem today is that many people 

have never felt close to God, and so the separation from 

sin, is not enough by itself to move these people to 

repentance. The problem today is that many people do not 

know where to find God, or how to begin looking, or how 

to tell if they have found the real thing. So, where do 

you find God? A Church may be a house of God, and so we 

may behave with respect, because it is a house of God. 

And God is present during the worship service, for we 

have the promise of Jesus, that when ever 2 or 3 are 

gathered in My name, there am I in the midst of them. 

But during the week, it tends to be quiet and lonely, so 

that the building by itself often has the effect of 

bringing out an entirely different feeling, instead of 

making us feel closer to God, it has the effect spoken 

of in the Psalm 22 <dr class='alt5'>"My God, My God, 

why have You forsaken Me?" (Psalm 22:1)</dr class='alt5'> It has this 

effect, because the first thing we hear when we are 

brought into the presence of God, is the law, and the 

law convicts us of sin, it makes us feel guilty, and is 

given to lead us to repent of sin. Your conscience, if 

you listen to it, will keep speaking the law to you. But 

you don’t find peace with God through the law. And 

perhaps that’s the biggest point, you don’t find God, 

rather God finds you.</p>
<h3>
God and Jacob
</h3>
<p>
Jacob was surprised to find God, away from his father’s 

house. But as I said, it was God who found Jacob, and 

God would continue to find Jacob. For every time God 

found Jacob, Jacob would run away, he was not yet ready 

to give up his grasping ways. He was not yet ready to 

receive the grace of God as an undeserved gift, he still 

thought it could be earned. It would not be until many 

years latter, that Jacob would stop running away. It 

would take many years, until Jacob would be willing to 

repent of his grasping ways. And it happened because God 

kept finding Jacob, and finally Jacob would repent, and 

give up his ways, and ask God to teach him how to follow 

God’s ways. And when that happened, God gave Jacob a new 

name, Israel. A new name, a new life, and the chief 

thing was in this new life, there was no grasping, there 

was instead God ruling, God’s grace providing for all 

need. If God is ruling your life, it is not hard to see 

God present where ever you are, for God indeed is 

everywhere.</p>
<h3>
See God's Presence through Faith
</h3>
<p>
The problem is that you cannot prove that God is present 

here, by science, or by reason. It is not even with our 

own eyes that we can see God present (for our own eyes 

are often blinded by sin). It is only through the eyes 

of faith, that we can see God present with us, 

throughout our life, in church, and at home, at work and 

at play. And knowing what God has done for us in Jesus 

Christ, and walking in His ways, it is peaceful and 

good. And we rejoice that God didn’t wait until we found 

Him, but He kept on coming, and finding us. God is 

present with us where ever we go. Why? Because at 

Baptism He came to dwell in our hearts, for Jesus sake. 

So God be with you all your days, for Jesus sake, unto 

life everlasting. Amen.</p>
