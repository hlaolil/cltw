<h3>
Receive the Holy Spirit
</h3>
<p>
When Jesus took His leave of those first eleven remaining disciples, nearing the end of the first part of their apprenticeship, He said to them, "go therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded you." And remember, He said, "that I am with you always, to the end of the age." Except He didn’t quite say always, He said, "I am with you all of the days." Jesus promises to be with them every day. That’s weird, isn’t it, as we said, and just as He takes His leave. How can this be? It’s John who explains it best. "Peace be with you," He said, coming into their locked room the evening after His resurrection. " As the Father has sent Me, so I send you." When He had said this, He breathed on them and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit."
</p>
 <p>
And in that instant, all Jesus' previous teaching must have become clear, all that stuff about a Spirit of truth, an advocate who will come to them, one who will take what is Jesus' and declare it to them, one who will turn their pain to joy, who will make it possible for them to ask anything in the name of Jesus and receive it. He is one who will be the sap in the vine of which they are a part.

<h3>
The key to our discipleship
</h3> 
<p> 
And here is the key to our discipleship. Jesus can lead you to a group of people with whom you can begin a new journey. You will begin to realise you are able talk to God in prayer. And through the prayer you will be overwhelmed by the cleansing, renewing presence of the Holy Spirit. And this will definitely change you! 
</p>
<p>
The key ingredient to our discipleship is the Holy Spirit. We cannot follow Jesus without the Holy Spirit, because Jesus is, clearly, not here. No puzzling conversations about fasting or Sabbaths, no master classes in casting out particularly resistant evil spirits, no incomprehensible trips up mountains or nights spent in gardens, no surreal stories, no disappearing and reappearing tricks. None of that is available to us. What is 
available to us we now find within ourselves, in the person of the Holy Spirit. 
</p>

If discipleship is anything, it has to be Trinitarian, linking us to Father, Son and Spirit
