   <h1>
Work of the Spirit as Comforter
</h1>
<p>
Our blessed Lord intimated to His disciples before His departure, that He would not leave them desolate, or orphans, but would send them the Holy Spirit,<dr class="alt5"> <br>that He might abide with them for ever; (John 14)</dr class="alt5"> and He spoke of the Spirit as a paraclete (a comforter, helper, advocate, or monitor), whose office it should be to plead the cause and to secure the welfare of His people in various ways, by helping their infirmities, guiding them into all truth, strengthening them against the assaults of temptation, sustaining them under the pressure of trial, and aiding them in the exercise of prayer.
</p> 
<p>
It is not necessary to dwell on the mere meaning of that expression, because unquestionably in other places the Spirit is represented as executing the office of a comforter; as when the apostle says,<dr class="alt5"> "Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit."(Rom 15:13)</dr class="alt5">. The peace and joy, and hope, which are here mentioned, are the constituent elements of that comfort which God has provided for His people; and elsewhere they are described as being of inestimable value, fruits alike sweet and precious of the riches of His grace: for this peace is called<dr class="alt5"> "the very peace of God, which passes all understanding" (Phil 4:7)</dr class="alt5">
</p>
</p>
<h2>
God Himself is the Author of this Comfort
</h2>
<p>
With reference to the source of this comfort, it is important to note, that the peace and joy and hope on which it consists are ascribed in Scripture to each of the three persons in the Godhead, and represented as flowing to us out of the various offices which they execute under the covenant of redemption. God Himself is the author of this comfort, the inexhaustible fountain of His goodness being the source whence it proceeds; but it is not as the God of nature and providence, the Creator, Preserver, and Governor of the world; it is as the God of grace and redemption, that He imparts it to His people. 
</p>
<p>
It is to God in His covenant relation as God in Christ - the Reconciler and the Saviour of the guilty, that the apostle refers, when he speaks of Him as <dr class="alt5">"the God of hope (Rom 15:13)</dr class="alt5">,<dr class="alt5">"and as "the God of patience and consolation;" (Rom 15:5)</dr class="alt5">  and more expressly still in another place, where he says, <dr class="alt5">"Blessed be God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them that are in any trouble by the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God." (2 Cor 1:3-4) </dr class="alt5">
</p>
<p>
<h2>
The Spirit's love as a Comforter
</h2>
<p>
The Spirit's love as a Comforter is manifested in various ways.</p> 
<p>
First, It was the Spirit with which Christ Himself was anointed, and by which He was qualified, in respect of His human nature, for the execution of His great design:<dr class="alt5"> "The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, for He has anointed Me to preach;" (Isa 61:1)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Secondly, It was the Spirit who dictated the whole of that message of grace and mercy which is contained in the gospel, for <dr class="alt5">"holy men of God spoke as they were moved by the Holy Ghost;" (2 Peter 1:21)</dr class="alt5"> and to Him, therefore, is to be gratefully ascribed every consolation which the Gospel imparts, and every hope which it inspires.</p>
<p>
Thirdly, It is the Spirit who, by His continued agency in the Church, and His internal operation on the minds of believers, enables them to understand the gracious meaning, and to feel the blessed influence of the gospel;<dr class="alt5"><br> Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit" (Rom 15:13)</dr class="alt5">
</p>
<h2>
The Spirit"s Means and Method
</h2>
<p>
Having seen that God in Christ is the inexhaustible source of that comfort which is imparted to His people by the agency of the Spirit, it will be of considerable practical importance to consider the means and method by which the Spirit fulfils this precious and endearing part of His work.
</p>
<p>
It would be a dangerous error to suppose that the Spirit comforts His people, by infusing peace and joy and hope into their hearts without the use of the ordinary means of grace, or separate and apart from His other fruits and operations as their teacher and sanctifier. He acts in this, as in every other part of His work, in a way that is consistent with the laws, and adapted to the necessities, of our moral nature. And His work is not divided; its various parts may be distinctly considered, but they never exist separately from each other; they constitute one grand work by which our happiness is secured while our holiness is advanced.
</p>
<h3>
Truth Revealed in the Word
</h3>
<p>
The Spirit comforts His people by means of the truth revealed in His Word, enabling them to understand its meaning, to feel its power, and especially to apply it to the case of their own souls. That the Gospel, or the truth contained in the Gospel, is the instrument by which the Spirit comforts His people, appears from the apostle's prayer for he prays that they might be <dr class="alt5">"filled with all peace and joy in believing;" (Rom 15:13)</dr class="alt5"> and from his language in another place, <dr class="alt5"><br>"For whatever things were written before were written for our learning, that we through the patience and comfort of the Scriptures might have hope"(Rom 15:4)</dr class="alt5"><br> David, too, refers to the same means of consolation, when he says,<dr class="alt5"> "This is my comfort in my affliction; for Your Word has quickened me." (Psa 119:50)</dr class="alt5">
</p>
<p>
He begins to impart this comfort at the very time of a sinner"s conversion; for no sinner is converted until he is so far enlightened in the knowledge of Christ as a Saviour, and persuaded of the certainty and freeness of the Gospel, as to feel that he may, as a sinner, guilty and helpless as he is in himself, to put his own personal trust in Christ, and to draw near to God through Him, in the humble hope that <dr class="alt5">"the one who comes to Me I will by no means cast out". (John 6:37)</dr class="alt5"> There is enough in these, the simplest elements of Gospel truth, to impart immediate relief and comfort to the sinner's heart, in as much that, like the Ethiopian treasurer, he may from that hour <dr class="alt5">"go on his way rejoicing."<br> (Acts 8:39)</dr class="alt5"> <br>For the Gospel of Christ is really a Gospel - good news, glad tidings of great joy, addressed as it is, not to the innocent, but to the guilty, and affording, as it does, to every man that is a sinner, and just because he is a sinner, a divine warrant to return to the Lord, in the assurance that he will have mercy upon him from God, who will abundantly pardon him.
</p>
<p>
But while, from the beginning of his Christian course, the believer may taste and see that the Lord is gracious, and may experience that measure of peace and joy and hope which the simplest elements of divine truth, when rightly understood and really believed, will inspire his comfort, like every other fruit of the Spirit, admits of growth and increase, and is advanced in proportion as he acquires larger and clearer views of the truth as it is in Jesus. 
</p>
<p>
It is of great practical importance to remember that all genuine evangelical comfort has its ground and warrant in the revealed truth of God; for then it is not delusive and groundless, like the false security of those who say, "Peace, peace, while there is no peace," but it is stable, and sound, and permanent, in proportion to the strength of the ground on which it rests.
</p>
<h3>
Sanctification
</h3>
<p>
Again, the Holy Spirit provides for the comfort of His people by sanctifying them. We read of two kinds of rest which Christ proposes to us in the Gospel; and these two are not only in separately conjoined in Scripture, but will be found, in experience, to be very intimately connected. The first is the rest of justification or pardon, of which Christ speaks when, addressing the guilty sinner laden with the burden of his sins, he says,<dr class="alt5"> "Come to Me, all you who labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." (Matt 11:28)</dr class="alt5"> He will take the burden of guilt away; He will abundantly pardon. But the second is the rest of sanctification,<dr class="alt5"> "Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls" (Matt 11:29)</dr class="alt5">
</p>
<p>
This comfort arises from the subjugation of our unholy passions, and the substitution in their room of the gracious fruits of the Spirit; which are essentially, in their own nature, as peaceful as they are lovely, and not only conducive to our happiness, but its constituent elements.
</p> 
<p>
The Spirit comforts us, then, by carrying on the great work of sanctification; but it is no part of his office to comfort us "in our sins;" and it is still true, as it ever was, that the wicked are as a raging sea, when it cannot rest; for <dr class="alt5">"there is no peace, says my God, to the wicked." (Isa 57:21)</dr class="alt5">
</p>
<h3>
Marks of Grace
</h3>
<p>
Again, the Spirit comforts His people by disclosing to them, and enabling the to discern such marks and evidences of a work of grace in their hearts, as may afford a comfortable assurance of their Son ship, and awaken a cheering hope of future glory.  <dr class="alt5">"The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ." (Rom 8:16-17) </dr class="alt5"> Here, too, the Spirit acts as our Comforter, not by making known our election with an audible voice, or revealing any thing that may not be gathered from the Word, when viewed in connection with our own experience, but simply by producing His gracious fruits, and then enabling us to discern them as so many scriptural marks and evidences of our conversion. For it is the presence of the Spirit in our hearts, evinced by the change which His power produces there, which is the witness or evidence of our Son ship:<br> <dr class="alt5">"By this we know that we abide in Him, and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit." (1 John 4:13) </dr class="alt5"> and <dr class="alt5">"Now He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who also has given us the Spirit as a guarantee." (2 Cor 5:5)</dr class="alt5"> and <dr class="alt5">"you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession." (Eph 1:13-14)<dr class="alt5">
</p>
<p>
I need not say that it is no part of the Spirit's work as a Comforter to exempt His people from trials; on the contrary, they seem to be subjected to afflictions at once more numerous and severe than are those of the men of this world; for, in addition to disease, and bereavement, and disappointment, which the share in common with others, they are exposed to trials which are peculiar to themselves.
</p>
<h2>
Degrees of Comfort and our Duty
</h2>
<p>
The comfort of which we have spoken, arising from our views of God's truth, the sanctification of our nature, and the inward witness of the Spirit, may exist in various degrees, according to the greater or less extent of our spiritual attainments; and this is intimated to us, as well as the duty of seeking for a large measure of evangelical comfort, in the apostle's prayer,<dr class="alt5"> <br>"Now may the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope by the power of the Holy Spirit." (Rom 15:13)</dr class="alt5">
