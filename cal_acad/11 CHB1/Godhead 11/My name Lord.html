 	<h1>
My Name is Lord
</h1>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty, but by My name Lord I was not known to them. (Exodus 6:3)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
 The patriarchs were privileged to know the God who made the covenant, but for them the covenant was barely fulfilled. The patriarchs knew God as the Maker of the covenant. Moses and the generation of the Exodus would know God as the One who fulfilled the covenant.</p>
<p class='crb'>
The patriarchs knew the name Yahweh (it is used some 160 times in Genesis); but the great application of the name referred to God who kept and fulfilled the covenant: I have also established My covenant with them. “The patriarchs had only the promises, not the things promised.” 
<p>
<h3>
As God Almighty
</h3>
<p>
 In addition, though the patriarchs knew God Almighty (El Shaddai), they did not know Him as extensively and intimately as He would reveal Himself to Moses and his generation. They knew the power of God, but didn’t have the same personal relationship and revelation Moses would come to know.</p>
 <p>
For us, God wants to be more than God Almighty - He wants us also to know Him as a personal, promise making and promise keeping God, whom we can trust in everything. Believers should ask themselves if they really know God by such names.

“The supreme need in every hour of difficulty and depression is a vision of God. To see Him is to see all else in proper proportion and perspective.”
