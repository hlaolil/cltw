<h1>Immanuel</h1>
<p>
The birth of Jesus is set in history. "They will call His name Immanuel!" To be called, according to Hebraic understanding, means that the person spoken of will in reality be what he is called and actually fulfil that title. Thus the name Immanuel points to the nature of the One who bears the name. He is God incarnate – God coming into human flesh – and dwells by His Spirit in the hearts of His people.</p>
<p>
Jesus Christ – God’s Son – God with us. What a comfort, what a joy to know He will never leave His own. He knows the frailty of our humanity, the weakness, the pain and the shame of being human because He became one with us. The wonder of the incarnation is that the babe in Bethlehem grew to be the Man who died on Calvary, taking our punishment, our guilt, and our blame, that His life might be ours.
Reflect today on how God is with you, and let the wonderful word Immanuel come alive in your spirit.</p>
