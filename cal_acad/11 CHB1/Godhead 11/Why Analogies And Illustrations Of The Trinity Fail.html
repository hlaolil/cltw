 	<h1>Why Analogies and Illustrations of The Trinity Fail</h1>
<p>
There’s a simple reason they don’t work: The Trinity, as such, isn’t like anything in creation. True, we humans are image bearers but nothing in creation serves as an analogy for the Trinity because the Trinity is a doctrine of special (biblical) revelation not nature or reason. That’s not to say that it’s not reasonable to believe the Trinity but only that it’s not revealed in nature as such, i.e., the doctrine of the Trinity cannot be deduced from nature. All analogies from nature are necessarily natural, ergo they’re invalid.
</p>
<h3>
Analogies from Nature
</h3>
<p>
The desire to find analogies in nature for the doctrine of the Trinity is understandable but it’s misguided. Scripture teaches us what we can know about God from nature:
<br>
<dr class="alt5">
Because what may be known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown it to them. For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse, (Rom 1:19–20).</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Paul affirms what can be known about God from nature: His existence and some of His attributes, “namely His eternal power and divine nature” can be perceived from nature. This natural revelation we must also affirm against those (e.g., Barth and oddly even some conservative Reformed and evangelical writers) as truth. God does reveal Himself in nature but there are limits. Paul teaches the Trinity explicitly but not here and not from nature. We cannot know Him only from nature. In classical Protestant categories, after the fall, what we know about God from nature is law or bad news. Thus, we confess in article 14 of the Belgic Confession ( http://www.prca.org/bc_index.html):
<p class="blockin">  
And being thus become wicked, perverse, and corrupt in all his ways, he has lost all his gifts which he had received from God, and retained only small remains thereof, which, however, are sufficient to leave man without excuse; for all the light which is in us is changed unto darkness, as the Scriptures teach us, saying: The light shines in darkness, and the darkness did not apprehended it; where John calls men darkness.
</p>
<h3>
Only in Scripture
</h3>
<p>
The Good News of Jesus’ incarnation, life, death, and resurrection for the justification (free acceptance with God for the sake of the crediting of Jesus’ righteousness to those who believe, received only through resting, trusting in Christ and His finished work for sinners) is only found in Scripture. Using this categorical distinction we should say that the doctrine of the Trinity belongs to special revelation (holy Scripture) along with the two natures of Christ, the incarnation, the obedience, righteousness, death, resurrection, and glorious bodily return of Christ. Thus, in article 9 of the Belgic, where the truth of the Trinity is demonstrated, the Reformed churches do not appeal to nature but to Scripture.</p>
<p>
As a matter of method, if the doctrine of the Trinity were evident from nature then why not the doctrines of the two natures of Christ or the atonement or perichoresis or justification or glorification? To say that is rationalism (reason over Scripture) and eventually to universalism. Again, both ancients and moderns have been tempted to take this path at times but the church universal has always rejected it because it is not taught in Scripture nor confessed in the Catholic creeds (Nicene, Athanasian, Apostles’) and Reformed confessions.</p>
<p class='crb'>After all, the answer to this question is a matter of keeping reason in its ministerial place and Scripture in its ruling place.</p>
