   <h1>The Doctrine of the Trinity</h1>
<p>
God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are each equally and eternally the one true God — is admittedly difficult to comprehend, and yet is the very foundation of Christian truth. Although sceptics may ridicule it as a mathematical impossibility, it is nevertheless a basic doctrine of Scripture as well as profoundly realistic in both universal experience and in the scientific understanding of the cosmos.</p>
<p>
Both Old and New Testaments teach the Unity and the Trinity of the Godhead. The idea that there is only one God, who created all things, is repeatedly emphasised in such Scriptures as Isaiah 45 -<dr class='alt5'> “For thus says the Lord, Who created the heavens, Who is God, Who formed the earth and made it, Who has established it, Who did not create it in vain, Who formed it to be inhabited: “I am the Lord, and there is no other.” (Isa 45:18)</dr class='alt5'><br>
A New Testament example is James 2 -<dr class='alt5'> “You believe that there is one God. You do well. Even the demons believe—and tremble!” (James 2:19)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
The three persons of the Godhead are, at the same time, noted in such Scriptures as Isaiah 48 -<dr class='alt5'>“I have not spoken in secret from the beginning; From the time that it was, I was there. And now the Lord God and His Spirit Have sent Me.”(Isa 48:16)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
The speaker in this verse is obviously God, and yet He says He has been sent both by The Lord God (that is, the Father) and by His Spirit (that is, the Holy Spirit).</p>
<p>
The New Testament doctrine of the Trinity is evident in a verse where the Lord Jesus said in John 15 <dr class='alt5'>“But when the Helper comes, whom I shall send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, He will testify of Me.” (John 15:26)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
Then there is the baptismal formula in

Matt 28 -<dr class='alt5'>“baptising them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit” (Matt 28:19)<dr class='alt5'></p> 
<p>
<h2>One God — three names!</h2>
<h3>
God the Father 
</h3>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>"In the Beginning God created the heaven and the earth."</dr class='alt5'> 
</p>
<p>
<h3>Jesus the Son </h3>
<p>
That Jesus, as the only-begotten Son of God, actually claimed to be God, equal with the Father, is clear from numerous Scriptures. For example in 
Rev 1 <dr class='alt5'><br>“I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End,” says the Lord, “who is and who was and who is to come, the 
Almighty”
 (Rev 1:8)</dr class='alt5'> </p>

<h3>Holy Spirit </h3>
<p>
Some cults falsely teach that the Holy Spirit is an impersonal divine influence of some kind, but the Bible teaches that He is a real person, just as are the Father and the Son.<br> Jesus said in
John 16 <dr class='alt5'>“However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come.” (John 16:13)</dr class='alt5'></p>

<h3>Triunity </h3>
<p>
The teaching of the Bible concerning the Trinity might be summarised thus. God is a Triunity, with each Person of the Godhead equally and fully and eternally God. Each is necessary, and each is distinct, and yet all are one. The three Persons appear in a logical, causal order. The Father is the unseen, omnipresent Source of all being, revealed in and by the Son, experienced in and by the Holy Spirit. The Son proceeds from the Father, and the Spirit from the Son. With reference to God's creation, the Father is the Thought behind it, the Son is the Word calling it forth, and the Spirit is the Deed making it a reality.</p>
<h3>
Seeing and Experiencing God
</h3>
<p>
We “see” God and His great salvation in the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, then “experience” their reality by faith, through the indwelling presence of His Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>
Though these relationships seem paradoxical, and to some completely impossible, they are profoundly realistic, and their truth is ingrained deep in man's nature. Thus, men have always sensed first the truth that God must be “out there,” everywhere present and the First Cause of all things, but they have corrupted this intuitive knowledge of the Father into pantheism and ultimately into naturalism.</p>
<p>
Similarly, men have always felt the need to “see” God in terms of their own experience and understanding, but this knowledge that God must reveal Himself has been distorted into polytheism and idolatry. Men have thus continually erected “models” of God, sometimes in the form of graven images, sometimes even in the form of philosophical systems purporting to represent ultimate reality.</p>
<h3>
Communion with God
</h3>
<p>
Finally, men have always known that they should be able to have communion with their Creator and to experience His presence “within.” But this deep intuition of the Holy Spirit has been corrupted into various forms of false mysticism and fanaticism, and even into spiritualism and demonism. Thus, the truth of God's triunity is ingrained in man's very nature, but he has often distorted it and substituted a false god in its place.</p>
