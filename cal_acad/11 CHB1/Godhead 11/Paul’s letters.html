   <h1>Paul’s letters</h1>
<p>
Paul’s experience gives him a theological understanding which is fundamentally Trinitarian, as is obvious from the following selection of teachings from his letters.</p>
<p>
Faced with division in the church at Corinth and a rejection of his version of the gospel in Galatia, Paul responds with clarifications of what he sees as the essentials of his gospel and in his responses we find the emerging Trinitarian structure of faith and prayer.</p>
<p>
Christ is for Paul the one and only foundation of the church and of his own faith and preaching. In writing to the Corinthians he expresses great surprise at the fact that divisions have occurred and factions formed around different versions of or emphases in the gospel. He reacts to the slogans:-<br><br> 
I am for Paul,<br><br> 
I am for Apollos, <br><br>
I am for Cephas’  <br><br>
with an emphatic<b class='alt3'> I am for Christ</b> (1 Cor 1:12).</p> 
<p>
More specifically, Paul points out that Christ crucified is <dr class='alt5'>"the power of God and the wisdom of God."</dr class='alt5'> even though He may be <dr class='alt5'>"to the Jews a stumbling block and to the Greeks foolishness,"</dr class='alt5'> because of the expectations of a powerful Messiah by the Jews and the exalted status given to a philosopher and wisdom teacher by the Greeks (1 Cor 1:22-25).<br> In writing to the Galatians he points out clearly the life-giving power of sharing in the crucifixion of Christ: <dr class='alt5'>"I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me."<br>(Gal 2:20)</dr class='alt5'> 
</p>
<h3>
What Conversion means to Paul
</h3>
<p>
For Paul, conversion to Christ or baptism in Christ’s name entails not only a cancelling out of past sins but it also marks the beginning of a new life in the Spirit.<br> He tells the Corinthians that we are <dr class='alt5'>"But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God." (1 Cor 6:11)</dr class='alt5'><br> Later he writes to the Romans: <dr class='alt5'>"But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you." (Rom 8:11).</dr class='alt5'><br> He also tells the Romans <dr class='alt5'>Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. (Rom 8:26).<dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>
Under the influence of the Holy Spirit
</h3>
<p>
Paul points out to the Corinthians that no one can say <dr class='alt5'>"Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit."(1 Cor 12:3).</dr class='alt5'><br> In his letter to the Galatians he states:<dr class='alt5'> "And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, “Abba, Father!” Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ." (Gal 4:6-7).</dr class='alt5'> <br> Similarly in his letter to the Romans he points out <dr class='alt5'>"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.  For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father.” The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified together"  (Rom 8:14-17).</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
Paul focuses also on the fact that the Spirit is teacher and guide. Writing to the Corinthians he states that God teaches us through the Spirit (1 Cor 2:10-12).<br> He tells the Galatians that we are directed and guided by the Spirit <br>(Gal 5:16,25). <br>This is an understanding very close to the understanding of the role of the Spirit in the gospels (Matt. 10:20; Mark 13:11) and it is especially close to the teaching of John’s gospel (John 14:26; 16:13-15).</p>
<p>
<h2>Community / ‘Koinonia’</h2>
<p>
The church is the continuation of Christ’s presence in the world. Paul builds on this insight in his teaching that members of the community should function in mutual dependence and harmony like the parts of a human body. <br> (1 Cor 12:12-30; Rom 12:4-8).<br> The author of Acts spells this out dramatically in the words of Jesus in the three accounts of the Damascus Road experience which clearly identify Jesus with the community:<br><dr class='alt5'>Then the Lord said, “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting." (Acts 9:5)</dr class='alt5'> <dr class='alt5'><br>"I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting." (Acts 22:8 )</dr class='alt5'> <dr class='alt5'><br>"Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?" (Acts 26:14).</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>
The words loved and holy
</h3>
<p>
The words chosen, loved and holy are repeatedly used to express the covenantal and grace-filled nature of the community’s relationship with the Father, Son and Spirit. In his first letter to the Thessalonians, Paul tells them that they are called and chosen (1 Thess. 4:1-12).<br> In his letter to the Romans he points out that they are <dr class='alt5'>"To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints" (Rom 1:7).</dr class='alt5'> Central to the functioning of the community as the Body of Christ is the presence of the Spirit, the giver of gifts for the building up of the community (1 Cor 12-13; Rom 12:6-8).  There are many gifts but one Spirit. As stated already, that Spirit is the Spirit that enables us to proclaim Jesus is Lord and to cry "Abba, Father".
</p>
<h3>
Gifts that build community
</h3>
<p>
Paul returns again and again to the question of harmony and mutual up building in community. Writing to the Corinthians he emphasises the gifts that build community, summing them all up under the rubric of love. <br>(1 Cor 12:13; cf Rom 12:6-8). <br>To the Romans he writes about "genuine love" (Rom 12:9-21)<br> To the Philippians he writes about humility as the underlying virtue underpinning all others in community (Phil 2:1-11).<br>To the Galatians he writes about life in the Spirit as opposed to licentiousness and self-indulgence which destroy individuals and communities (Gal 5:13-26).<br> Gentleness and forgiveness are highlighted in Colossians (Col 3:12-17).<br> The Pauline tradition reaches a great climax in Ephesians with its extraordinary emphasis on unity as God reveals the mystery of His purpose to "gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in heaven and which are on earth" (Eph 1:9-10).</p>
<p class='block'><dr class='alt1'>
In the rapidly changing society of the Roman Empire, Paul and the guardians of his legacy in the Deutero-Pauline letters, aimed to maintain Christian harmony in the home and liturgical assembly by setting the established social norms "in Christ". The social structures and accepted roles of husband and wife, master and slave have radically changed since then but the love, mutual respect, co-operation and harmony which Paul sought and set in the context of Christ and His kingdom, are still a challenge to us today in our family and social relations.</p>
