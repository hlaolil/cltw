   <h1>The Being of God</h1>
<p>
The Word of God, the Scripture, has four characteristics: 
<ul>
<li> 
Authority; 
</li>
<li>
Clarity; 
</li>
<li>
Necessity and 
</li>
<li>
Sufficiency.
</li>
</ul>
<p> 
The Bible is necessary for knowing the gospel, for maintaining spiritual life and for knowing the will of God. However, this does not include the knowledge that God exists or for knowing something about God’s character and moral laws. The Bible believes in the existence of God. So it does not need to prove His existence.
</p>
<p> 
There are so many witnesses in nature that points to the existence of God. Let us look at some Bible passages to buttress this. <br> Psalm 19<dr class='alt5'> “The heavens declare the glory of God; And the firmament shows His handiwork". (Psalm 19:1)</dr class='alt5'><br> Rom 1 <dr class='alt5'>“For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse,.” (Rom 1:20)</dr class='alt5'> <br> Also read Acts 14:16-17
</p>
<p>
The inner witness of the human conscience points to this too Rom 2 <dr class='alt5'>“for when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do the things in the law, these, although not having the law, are a law to themselves" (Rom 2:14)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
The soul feels God. As human beings we feel uneasy or are apprehensive when we do wrong. This feeling confirms the existence of conscience telling us that there is God, a moral Lawgiver, to Whom we must all give account.
</p>
<h3>
Man is by nature a religious being. 
</h3>
<p>
But for the Bible and the new birth, man would have been an atheist or an idolater. The religion of man deifies humanity. Hence we have expressions like “Creative thinking”, “The dignity of man”, “Positive thinking”, “Building a new world” etc. These are all attempts to magnify man and minimise God in religion, thought and activity.
The Bible does not discuss with the atheist for not believing in God but reproves him for doing so. <br>Psalm 14 <dr class='alt5'>“The fool has said in his heart, “There is no God.” They are corrupt, They have done abominable works,…” (Psalm 14:1)</dr class='alt5'> Read also Psalm 53:1. Continual disobedience to God which stems from a darkened understanding attracts Divine punishment. <br> See Rom 1 <dr class='alt5'>“And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do those things which are not fitting;” (Rom 1:28)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>
Human nature and God
</h3>
<p>
The true God is not the God man wanted (Rom 1:21). The human nature as a result of its moral degradation hates the true God (please read Rom 1:18-32 before you continue). We see from Rom 1:18-32 that:
<ol>
<li>
Human beings had the truth about God in the book of nature
</li>
<li>
Human beings willingly suppressed the truth about God
</li>
<li>
God through the things that He had made revealed His eternal power and Deity, but men did not like this truth
</li>
<li>
Human beings changed the truth about God into a lie and made images or representatives of God 
</li>
<li>
Human beings’ refusal to worship God led them into idolatry
</li>
<li>
Idolatry gave birth to sensuality which begot uncleanness and vile affections
</li>
<li>
God removed His restraining grace and allowed human nature to go its full length in 
immorality.
</li>
</ol></p>
<p>
Today the world is filled with all forms of evil. The world is at the lowest ebb in depravity. Humans not only take pleasure in committing these atrocious acts but take pleasure in seeing others do them.
</p>
<p class='block'><dr class='alt'>
The witness of God in nature does not constitute the light of the gospel. Neither are they efficient as means of salvation. But they are able to make men realise that they are sinners. A further revelation of God to man is in His written Word, which is a witness to the incarnate Word, Jesus Christ the Lord. Do you want to know Him then seek Him through His Word.
