 	<h1>Depend on God only</h1>
<p><p class='block'><dr class='alt1'>
Faith is a universal experience – everyone, including the atheist, lives by faith. The issue is not whether we will trust in a belief system or trust in people or things, but whether we are placing our trust in that which is reliable or untrustworthy. Faith is only as good as the object in which it is placed.</p>
<h3>
Trusting in man or in God 
</h3> 
<p>
The prophet Jeremiah provides us with a look at two conflicting sources of personal dependence -<p> This is what the Lord says about trusting in man: <dr class='alt5'><br> “Cursed is the man who trusts in man And makes flesh his strength, Whose heart departs from the Lord. For he shall be like a shrub in the desert, And shall not see when good comes, But shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, In a salt land which is not inhabited." (Jeremiah 17:5-6)</dr class='alt5'> <p>This is what the Lord says about trusting in Him: <br> <dr class='alt5'> “Blessed is the man who trusts in the Lord, And whose hope is the Lord. For he shall be like a tree planted by the waters, Which spreads out its roots by the river, And will not fear when heat comes; But its leaf will be green,
And will not be anxious in the year of drought, Nor will cease from yielding fruit.”  <br>(Jeremiah 17:7-8)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p> 
Jeremiah draws a sharp contrast between those who depend on human strength and those who depend on the living God. He makes it clear that we cannot look to both as our supreme basis of trust; we will either put our hope in the promises and power of people, or we will look beyond human capability to the person and promises of God. When we make people the basis of our confidence we experience rejection and disappointment again and again. But when God becomes the ultimate source of our confidence, we are never let down.</p>
<p>
Habakkuk learned that <dr class='alt5'>“the just shall live by his faith” (Habakkuk 2:4)</dr class='alt5'> and he was not talking about faith in men. <dr class='alt5'><br>“The fear of man brings a snare, But whoever trusts in the Lord shall be safe.” (Proverbs 29:25)</dr class='alt5'> Those who put more confidence in themselves or in other people than in God will find bitterness and disappointment in the end. They may appear to prosper for a season, but the journey will not get them to their desired goals. But those who transfer their trust from themselves or the promises of others to the Lord will discover that their lives are deeply rooted in well-watered soil. <br>The Lord declares that <dr class='alt5'>“those who honour Me I will honour, and those who despise Me shall be lightly esteemed.” (1 Samuel 2:30)</dr class='alt5'></p>
