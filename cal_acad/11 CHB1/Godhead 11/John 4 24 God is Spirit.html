 <h1>
   God is Spirit</h1>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>
"God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.”  (John 4:24)</dr class='alt5'>
<h3>
Worshipping God</h3>
<p>
The second commandment deals with how we worship. The worship of God involves the totality of life, and thus it cannot be confined to a particular location or concentrated in a mere hour or two on a given day.</p>
<p>
Our focus in worship is to be on imitating Him in the totality of life. We are to use no material aids in doing this because no one can capture in a work of art what God is. God wants us to concentrate on what He is, not on what He looks like. However, given human nature's strong attraction to the physical, it is not easy for a person to surrender the dominance of the physical over his life. A person's first step backward from conversion is usually to become grudgingly willing to share time and energy that should go to God with someone or something else.</p>
<p>
When asked what the first and great commandment of the law is, Jesus replied, quoting Deuteronomy 6:5, <dr class='alt5'>"You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind" (Matthew 22:37).</dr class='alt5'> <br
>Anything less will affect the quality of our worship. This is a high pinnacle to reach for, requiring a lifetime of growth in wisdom, knowledge, understanding, and character built by overcoming the world, the flesh, and the Devil.</p>
<h3>
Worship is a Response to God</h3>
<p>
Worship, which is our response to God, is what we give in our devoted service. The worship of God involves the totality of life, therefore it cannot be confined to a particular location. Earlier, Jesus says, "Neither in Samaria, nor in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem." He means that God is not confined to any one place, nor is the worship of Him confined to any one place. Likewise, it cannot be confined to just an hour or two on a particular day because in a biblical sense the worship of God is our response to Him in all of life. So He cannot even be isolated to an hour or two on the Sabbath.</p>
<p>
We have to respond to Him in our home: in the way we speak, act towards one another, rear our children, conduct our homemaking practices. Worship has to do with the way we work, with the way we drive our cars, with the way we dress, with the way we use our eyes, ears, nose, mouth—everything! It involves the totality of life, because religion is a way of life. Christianity is a way of life that impacts on every area of our being.</p>
<p>
The second commandment deals with how we worship God. The focus of our worship is to be on imitating Him. We are to use no material aids in doing this because no man can capture God in a work of art, a statue, a picture, or a symbol. God wants us to concentrate on what He is and not on what He looks like.</p>
<p>
It is not easy for human nature to surrender its dominance over one's life. Human nature's first step backwards—to giving up its dominance over our lives—is usually a grudging willingness to share time and energy with God. Yet, when Jesus is asked, "What is the first and great commandment," He replies that we are to love Him with all of our heart, soul, and mind. Notice, it is not just with part of our lives but everything. The second commandment has to do with how to worship Him, and anything less than what Jesus states in Matthew 22:37 will affect the quality of our worship.</p>
<h3>
The King James Translation</h3>
<p>
The King James has wrongly translated this verse from the Greek. It really says "God is spirit," not "a" spirit - there is no indefinite article in the Greek. Basically, Jesus is saying that God is invisible and immaterial.</p>
<h3>
God's Form</h3>
<p>This scripture directly refers to the Father. "Spirit" is used in the sense of composition. However, just because the Father and the Son are spirit does not mean they have no form, albeit not material. God is Spirit, and nowhere, not even in one verse, does it say that God does not have a body. He is perfect, immortal, infinite, immutable, self-existing, omnipotent, omniscient, invisible, impartial, absolutely holy, full of knowledge and wisdom, and sufficient to provide for His entire creation.</p>
<p>
The Bible shows that He has a head, hair, face, arms, fingers, hands, waist, loins, eyes, eyelids, nostrils, ears, mouth, lips, tongue, breath, feet, and back parts. God even speaks of His heart! He rests, but He does not get tired. He feels things. He eats and drinks, and the alcohol in wine, as Judges 9:13 says, has an effect on Him: It cheers His heart. He laughs. He becomes angry. He speaks in a small still voice; He roars from Zion. As a man, He wept. Sounds a great deal like us, does it not? It should because we are made in His image and likeness.</p>
<p>
But there is even more. He goes about from place to place in a body, just like anybody else. He rides in a vehicle. He walks. He plants. He works. He lives in a spiritual place called heaven.</p>
<p>
Yet, despite all these biblical descriptions, the men and women who claim that God has no body never cite any other passage except John 4:24 as proof. But He has revealed Himself in so many different ways in His Word that what these people say turns God into a liar who deceives mankind about what He is like.</p>
<p class="crb">
Let us be clear: John 4:24 does not teach that God has no body. It, plus a multitude of passages that we have read or alluded to, expand our understanding about the properties of spirit—about what spirit bodies are like. Spirit is just as real as matter, except that it is a much higher type of substance and is governed by higher laws.</p>
<p>
John 4:24 is a statement of fact, but it does not define or analyze spirit. The properties of spirit are described throughout the Bible, as those who actually saw and heard God and interacted with Him reported their experiences. Either they are right, or these modern writers are. They cannot both be right because they contradict each other. Which will we believe?</p>
<h3>
What exactly is Spirit?</h3>
<p>
This scripture plainly states that God is Spirit, but the verse does not define what "spirit" is in reference to God. It says nothing at all about form, shape, or composition. It states only this fact, and one must look elsewhere in the Bible to find information concerning His form and shape.</p>
<p>
The word spirit is translated in the Old Testament from the Hebrew ruach, and in the New Testament the Greek pneuma. Both of these words have the same fundamental meaning and usage, "an invisible force or power."</p>
<h3>
The Truth is to be Found in Scripture</h3>
<p>
Faith comes by hearing the Word of God, the Bible. Unless the words spoken conform to it, they are merely doctrines of men and do not reflect the true God, for those that worship Him must worship in spirit and truth. This requires searching the Scripture as the Bereans did to verify if the preacher's words are true (Acts 17:11). One cannot know the true God unless one knows the truth of God.</p>
<p class="crb">
God is not merely a force or influence or a thought in the minds of people. Also, <dr class='alt5'>"Therefore, since we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, something shaped by art and man’s devising." (Act 17:29).</dr class='alt5'></p>
<h3>
Some Scripture References</h3>
<p>God is a person. He has a personality and emotions (Ge 6:6; Zeph 3:17; 1John 4:8, and 16). He has a mind (Isa 40:28, Jer 32:35, and Rom 11:34) and reasoning (Isa 1:18).</p>

<p>He has a spiritual body with shape (John 5:37) and form (Phil 2:6), as can be understood from many examples in the Bible where people saw Him (Ex 24:9-11, 33:21-23; Isa 6:1, 5; Ezek 1:26-28, 10:20; Dan 7:9-14; Am 9:1; Act 7:56; and Rev 4:2-5). Col 1:15 and 1Tim 1:17 do say that God is invisible, but in light of these instances where people saw Him, it must be understood that He is invisible to our natural sight even as are angels. However, He can and has manifested Himself.</p>

<p>Jesus said in John 6:46 that no one has seen the Father, and Paul said in 1Ti 6:16 that no one can see the Father. However, Ex 33:20-23 shows that this must be speaking of seeing the Lord face to face because Moses did see God's "back parts." Taken in context, Ex 33:11 must be using "face to face" as a way of saying God talked to Moses openly or directly without having to use visions or dreams (compare with Num 12:4-8).<dr class='alt5'> <br>"There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body" (1Cor 15:44).</dr class='alt5'></p>
