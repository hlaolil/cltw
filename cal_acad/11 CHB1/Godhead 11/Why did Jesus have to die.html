<h1>Why did Jesus have to die</h1>
<p>
Over the years I've been asked, "Why did 

Jesus have to die?" Once an earnest 

seeker followed the question with these 

comments, "As a Christian I should know 

the answer, but I can’t think of any 

convincing explanation. No exemplar of 

any other religion that I can think of ended 

up getting killed because of his beliefs. 

Why wouldn't it have been possible for 

Jesus to spread his message and gain 

adherents like Mohamed, Moses and 

Buddha? Does Christianity only make 

sense by God deciding that Jesus had to 

be crucified?"</p>
<h2>Why Did Jesus Have to Die?</h2>
<p>
This incredibly important question 

involves a matter central to Christianity, 

yet effectively answering it is often difficult 

for Christians. We will take a careful look 

at the question and lay out the answers 

offered in Scripture.
However, before we answer the question, 

"Why did Jesus have to die?" it's also 

important to understand that Jesus clearly 

understood His mission on earth, and that 

it involved laying down His life as a 

sacrifice. In other words, Jesus knew it 

was His Father's will for Him to die.</p>
<p>
He proves His foreknowledge and 

understanding of His death in these 

passages from Scripture:
<p>
Mark 8 <dr class="alt5">And He began to teach 

them that the Son of Man must suffer 

many things, and be rejected by the 

elders and chief priests and scribes, and 

be killed, and after three days rise again. (Mark 8:31) 

(Also see Mark 9:31)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p><dr class="alt5">
<p>
Mark 10 <dr class="alt5">Taking the twelve 

disciples aside, Jesus once more began 

to describe everything that was about to 

happen to Him in Jerusalem. "Now 

they were on the road, going up to 

Jerusalem, and Jesus was going before 

them; and they were amazed. And as 

they followed they were afraid. Then He 

took the twelve aside again and began to 

tell them the things that would happen to 

Him: “Behold, we are going up to 

Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be 

betrayed to the chief priests and to the 

scribes; and they will condemn Him to 

death and deliver Him to the Gentiles; 

and they will mock Him, and scourge 

Him, and spit on Him, and kill Him. And 

the third day He will rise again.” (Mark 10:32-34)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Mark 10 <dr class="alt5">But Jesus said to them, 

“You do not know what you ask. Are you 

able to drink the cup that I drink, and be 

baptised with the baptism that I am 

baptised with?" (Mark 10:38)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Mark 10 <dr class="alt5">Yet it shall not be so 

among you; but whoever desires to 

become great among you shall be your 

servant. And whoever of you desires to 

be first shall be slave of all. For even 

the Son of Man did not come to be 

served, but to serve, and to give His life a 

ransom for many.” (Mark 10:43-45)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Mark 14 <dr class="alt5">As they were eating, 

Jesus took a loaf of bread and asked 

God's blessing on it. Then he broke it in 

pieces and gave it to the disciples, 

saying, " And as they were eating, 

Jesus took bread, blessed and broke it, 

and gave it to them and said, “Take, eat; 

this is My body.” Then He took the cup, 

and when He had given thanks He gave it 

to them, and they all drank from it. And 

He said to them, “This is My blood of the 

new covenant, which is shed for many. 

 Assuredly, I say to you, I will no longer 

drink of the fruit of the vine until that day 

when I drink it new in the kingdom of 

God.” (Mark 14:22-25)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
John 10<dr class="alt5"> "Therefore My Father 

loves Me, because I lay down My life that I 

may take it again. No one takes it from 

Me, but I lay it down of Myself. I have 

power to lay it down, and I have power to 

take it again. This command I have 

received from My Father."</li></p>
<p> 
This last verse also explains why it is 

pointless to blame the Jews or the 

Romans—or anyone else for that matter, 

for "killing" Jesus. Jesus, having the 

power to "lay it down" or "take it again," 

freely gave up His life. It truly doesn't 

matter who "killed" Jesus. The ones who 

nailed the nails only helped carry out the 

destiny He came to fulfil by laying down 

His life on the cross.<br> (John 10:17-18)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Now, on to answering the question, "Why 

did Jesus have to die?" </p>
<h2>God is Holy</h2>
<p>
Although God is all merciful, all powerful 

and all forgiving, God is also holy, 

righteous and just.</p>
<p>
Isaiah 5 <dr class="alt5">But the Lord of hosts shall 

be exalted in judgement, And God who is 

holy shall be hallowed in 

righteousness. (Isaiah 5:16)</dr class="alt5"></p>
</p>
<h3>Sin and Holiness are 

Incompatible</h3>
<p>
Sin entered the world through one man's 

disobedience - Adam, and now all of us 

are born into this "sin nature."
</p>
<p>Romans 5 <dr class="alt5">Therefore, just as 

through one man sin entered the world, 

and death through sin, and thus death 

spread to all men, because all 

sinned— <br>(Rom 5:12)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Romans 3 <dr class="alt5">for all have sinned and 

fall short of the glory of God, (Rom 3:23) </dr class="alt5">
</p>
<h3>Sin Separates Us from God</h3>
<p>
Isaiah 35 <dr class="alt5">A highway shall be there, 

and a road, And it shall be called the 

Highway of Holiness. The unclean shall 

not pass over it, But it shall be for others. 

Whoever walks the road, although a fool, 

Shall not go astray. (Isa 35:8)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
Isaiah 59 <dr class="alt5">But your iniquities have 

separated you from your God; And your 

sins have hidden His face from you, So 

that He will not hear. (Isa 59:2)</dr class="alt5">
</p>
<h3>Sin's Punishment is Eternal 

Death</h3>
<p>
God's holiness and justice demand that 

sin and rebellion be punished. The only 

penalty or payment for sin is eternal 

death.
<p>
Romans 6 <dr class="alt5">For the wages of sin is 

death, but the gift of God is eternal life in 

Christ Jesus our Lord. (Rom 6:23)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>Romans 5 <dr class="alt5">so that as sin reigned in 

death, even so grace might reign through 

righteousness to eternal life through 

Jesus Christ our Lord. (Romans 5:21)</dr class="alt5"></li></ul>
</p>
<h3>Atoning Sacrifice</h3>
<p>
Our death is not sufficient to atone for sin 

because atonement requires a perfect, 

spotless sacrifice, offered in just the right 

way. Jesus, the one perfect God-man, 

came to offer the pure, complete and 

everlasting sacrifice to remove, atone, 

and make eternal payment for our sin.
</p>
<p>1 Peter 1 <dr class="alt5">knowing that you 

were not redeemed with corruptible 

things, like silver or gold, from your 

aimless conduct received by tradition 

from your fathers, but with the 

precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb 

without blemish and without spot. (1 Peter 1:18-19 18)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>Hebrews 2 <dr class="alt5">Inasmuch then 

as the children have partaken of flesh and 

blood, He Himself likewise shared in the 

same, that through death He might 

destroy him who had the power of death, 

that is, the devil, and release those 

who through fear of death were all their 

lifetime subject to bondage. For indeed 

He does not give aid to angels, but He 

does give aid to the seed of Abraham.

Therefore, in all things He had to be made 

like His brethren, that He might be a 

merciful and faithful High Priest in things 

pertaining to God, to make propitiation for 

the sins of the people. (Heb 2:14-17)</dr class="alt5">
</p>
<h3>Only Through Jesus Christ</h3>
<p>
Only through Jesus Christ can our sins 

be forgiven, thus restoring our relationship 

with God and removing the separation 

caused by sin.
</p>
<p>2 Corinthians 5 <dr class="alt5">For He made Him 

who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we 

might become the righteousness of God 

in Him. (2 Cor 5:21)</dr class="alt5"></p>
<p>
1 Corinthians 1  <dr class="alt5">But of Him you are in 

Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom 

from God—and righteousness and 

sanctification and redemption (1 Cor 1:30)</dr class="alt5">
</p>
<h3>The Messiah - Saviour</h3>
<p>
The suffering and the glory of the coming 

Messiah was foretold in Isaiah chapters 

52 and 53. God's people in the Old 

Testament looked forward to the Messiah 

that would save them from their sin. 

Although He did not come in the form they 

expected, still, their faith, which looked 

forward to his salvation, saved them. Our 

faith, which looks backward to his act of 

salvation, saves us. When we accept 

Jesus' payment for our sin, his perfect 

sacrifice washes away our sin and 

restores our right standing with God. 

God's mercy and grace provided a way 

for our salvation.
</p>
<p>Romans 5 <dr class="alt5">For if when we were 

enemies we were reconciled to God 

through the death of His Son, much more, 

having been reconciled, we shall be 

saved by His life. (Rom 5:10)</dr class="alt5"></li></ul></p>
<p>
<p class='crb'>
In Summary, when we are "in Christ 

Jesus" we are covered by His blood 

through His sacrificial death, our sins are 

paid for, and we no longer have to die an 

eternal death. We receive eternal life 

though Jesus Christ. And this is why 

Jesus had to die.</p>
