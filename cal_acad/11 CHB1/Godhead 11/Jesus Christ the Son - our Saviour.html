   <h1>
Jesus Christ the Son - our Saviour
</h1>
<p>
The central figure of the Christian faith is our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</p>
<p class="block"><dr class='alt3'>
Christ Jesus is the Messiah prophesied in Hebrew Scripture, our Old Testament of the Bible. All four Gospels record Jesus calling Himself the "Son of Man," which reminds us that He fulfils the destiny of the Messianic figure in Chapter Seven of the Book of the Prophet Daniel.</dr class='alt3'> </p>
<p>
He was conceived by the Holy Spirit (Luke 1:35), born of the Virgin Mary (Luke 2:7), suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried (John 19). He descended to the dead (1 Peter 3:19). On the third day He rose from the dead (Mark 16:6), ascended into heaven, and sat at the right hand of God (Mark 16:19, Hebrews 12:2). From there He will come again to judge the living and the dead (Matthew 25:31-46). </p>
<p>
Jesus Christ is the Son of God, the Word made flesh. He is the Authority on Scripture (Luke 24:25-27, Galatians 1:11-12, 2 Timothy 3:15-17, 2 Peter 1:21). </p>
<p>
The New Testament writers each offer a unique picture of Christ Jesus. The Evangelists Matthew, Mark, and Luke record the earthly life and teachings of Jesus. </p>
<h3>
Matthew
</h3>
<p>
The Gospel of Matthew stresses that Jesus is the Messiah foretold in Hebrew Scripture, the fulfilment of the Old Testament prophecies, for example, the Messiah will be born of a virgin (Isaiah 7:14), and that He would be born in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2). There are elements to Matthew's Gospel that are unique to it alone, such as the Star of Bethlehem, the complete Sermon on the Mount, and the Last Judgement ("As you did it to one of the least of my brethren, you did it to me"). The Gospel ends with a reference to the Trinity, when Jesus commissioned His Apostles to "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the holy Spirit," reassuring us He will be with us to the end of the age. </p>
<h3>
Mark
</h3>
<p>
The Gospel of Mark opens with a declaration that Jesus is the Son of God, and God the Father and the Holy Spirit appear during His Baptism in the River Jordan, an early reference to the mystery of the Trinity. Jesus declares His mission in Mark 1:15, that "the Kingdom of God is at hand, to repent and believe in the Gospel." Discipleship in Mark is described as self-denial (8:34-35) and service (10:43-44). The human emotional side of Jesus is perhaps best portrayed in the Gospel of Mark. </p>
<h3>
Luke
</h3>
<p>
The physician Luke was the only Gentile of the New Testament writers. Luke, one of Paul's companions on his journeys, began his Gospel with the birth of Jesus, conceived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary. Parables unique to Luke reveal the mercy of God through the Parables of the Good Samaritan and the Prodigal Son, His justice through the Parable of Lazarus and the rich man, and His praise of humility in the Parable of the Pharisee and the Tax Collector. The Gospel of Luke is the only Gospel with a sequel, The Acts of the Apostles. Acts details the fulfilling of Christ's mission through the Apostles, who are to be His witnesses to the ends of the earth (Luke 24:45-48, Acts 1:8) following their reception of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost (Acts 2:1-4). </p>
<h3>
John
</h3>
<p>
The Apostle and Evangelist John concerned himself with the spirit in his Gospel, three Letters, and the Book of Revelation. For John it was the mystery of the Incarnation, who Christ was. Jesus, whom the Apostles had known and followed for three years, was at the same time the Son of God and the Word made Flesh, a human as the rest of us. This principle of the Incarnation introduced in the Prologue became the guiding theme for John's entire Gospel, so that we must distinguish throughout the life of Jesus His human aspect and the mystery of "the Son who comes from the Father," a mystery that reveals itself in the man Jesus. </p>
<h3>
Paul
</h3>
<p>
Paul knew only the risen Christ. Struck down as Saul (Acts 9:3-7), the Pharisee who had been so passionate in his persecution of Christians, Paul was saved by Christ Himself! He then became just as passionate in spreading Christianity, with his fourteen letters and four missionary journeys from Antioch and the East to the European world of the time. It was thus natural for Paul, the man saved by Jesus, to write of Christ as Lord, Redeemer and Saviour, to see the Cross and Resurrection as salvation for mankind. </p>
<h3>
Peter
</h3>
<p>
Peter and his brother Andrew were the first two Apostles to follow Jesus. Peter was the first to recogniSe Jesus as the Christ, the long-awaited Messiah. Peter was made the "rock" upon which Jesus built His Church (Matthew 16:18-19). Peter also denied Jesus three times, then broke down and wept; but he later reaffirmed his loyalty three times following the Resurrection of Christ (John 21:15-19). Inspired by the Holy Spirit at Pentecost, he became a dynamic evangelist, as described in the Acts of the Apostles. After preaching in Jerusalem, he established the Church in Antioch, before he became the first Bishop of Rome. Peter sees Jesus as the model for all Christians in his two letters. </p>
<h3>
James and Jude Thaddeus 
</h3>
<p>
The Apostles James and Jude Thaddeus were the two final New Testament writers, each contributing one letter each to the catholic (universal) letters. Their letters are pastoral in nature, calling upon early Christians to be faithful followers of Christ through their conduct and performance of good works. </p>
