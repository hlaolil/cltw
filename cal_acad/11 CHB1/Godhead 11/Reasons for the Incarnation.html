   <h1>Reasons for the Incarnation</h1> 
<p>   
You'd be hard-pressed to come up with a greater and more glorious mystery than the incarnation. That God took on human flesh is a truth worthy of our deepest gratitude, wonder, and adoration. However, as we reflect on this mystery, my guess is that most of us haven't spent much time thinking about why God took on flesh. Sure, He was demonstrating His infinite love, but why did He do it this way?</p>
<p>
The Bible answers this 'why' question from different angles, but I want to point you to four reasons for the incarnation from Hebrews. The author of Hebrews tells us that Jesus shared in our <dr class='alt5'>"flesh and blood" (Heb 2:14),</dr class='alt5'> and it gives us four purposes for this glorious reality in Hebrews 2:</p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>"Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil, and release those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage. For indeed He does not give aid to angels, but He does give aid to the seed of Abraham. Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. For in that He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able to aid those who are tempted." (Hebrews 2:14-18)</dr class='alt5'><br>
The Son of God came in the flesh to do the following:</p>
<h3>Destroy the Devil </h3>
<p>
Ever since the Fall, the devil has tempted men to sin and led them down a road of destruction. But Christ broke the devil's stranglehold on death by dying. This sinless man took the punishment for sin that only a man could take (Heb 2:14). He destroyed the devil, and the cross was His weapon. One day that destruction will be evident to all (Rev 20:10).</p>
<h3>To Deliver Lifelong Slaves </h3>
<p>
We are enslaved by the fear of death and the coming judgement. Whether we admit it or not, we know our sin will find us out.(Heb 2:15) But Jesus removed that enslaving fear by tasting death for us (Heb 2:9). Because He has absorbed God's wrath, the devil can no longer hold this harrowing fate over our heads. For those who belong to Christ, the tables have turned: death is gain (Phil 1:21). We are free.</p>
<h3>To Be a Merciful and Faithful High Priest </h3>
<p>
By being made like us, Jesus can sympathise with our weaknesses (Heb 4:15). He knows what it is like to be tempted and to suffer as a man. He was also able to demonstrate His faithfulness by His unswerving and glad obedience to the Father while on earth (Heb 3:2). As His people, we have every reason to trust such a high priest.(Heb 2:17)</p>
<h3>To Make Propitiation for the Sins of His People  </h3>
<p>
A propitiation is an atoning sacrifice, and that's exactly what Jesus offered when He died on the cross. He removed our sin and the wrath we had incurred. Making sacrifices is what all priests do, but this high priest gave His own life for the sins of His people. Christ's death provides for us the forgiveness of sins and the promise of eternal life. (Heb 2:17)</p>
<p class='crb'>
Much more could be said from Hebrews and from other places in God's Word about why Jesus came in the flesh. But for now, these four reasons from Hebrews 2:14-18 should give us enough to be thankful for to last a good while. Understanding not only that Jesus came in the flesh but also why He did gives us all the more reason to love and worship Him.</p>
