<h1>
Father God
</h1>
To call God “Father” means, then, 

that He is near to us, intimately 

concerned with us, fond of us, even 

crazy about us.  He is not the 

distant, clockmaker God of Thomas 

Jefferson and the Deists.   This 

aloof God of the philosophers 

created the world to run by virtue 

of its own natural laws so that He 

could withdraw and occupy Himself 

with more interesting pursuits. 
</p>
<h3>
The Father who cares 
</h3>
<p>
No, the God whom Jesus calls Father 

cares about us and knows us 

intimately. <dr class='alt5'> “Every hair on your 

head is numbered (Matthew 10:30).”</dr class='alt5'> 

He loves us more than we love 

ourselves and knows us better than 

we know ourselves.
</p>
<p> 
Now, this does not mean that He 

makes all things go smoothly for 

us.  He loves us so much that He 

made us in His image and likeness, 

which means He made us free.  And 

through the free choice of the 

first man, evil and death were 

invited into our world.  He does 

not shield us from all the 

troublesome consequences of this 

“original sin” which each of us, 

sadly, has ratified with our own 

personal sin.  But He sent us 

prophets, like Jeremiah, to wake us 

up and warn us of the horrible 

consequences of disobedience.  And 

finally He sent His first born Son 

to be a new Adam, to pay the price 

of that disobedience and give the 

human race an undeserved new start.
</p>
<h3>
Consequence of sin
</h3>
<p> 
The most horrible consequence of 

sin, eternal death (Gehenna), has 

been graciously removed for all who 

accept the free gift of salvation 

that comes by way of the cross of 

Christ.  But evil is still at large 

in the world, and evil brings 

trials and tribulations.  Our 

Father will not shelter us from 

these any more than He sheltered 

Jeremiah (Jer 20:10-13) or Jesus.  

A good father doesn’t protect his 

children forever from the harsh 

realities of life, but helps them 

as they progress through various 

stages of development to face the 

challenges and grow through the 

difficulties.  Scripture says that 

even Jesus learned obedience 

through what He suffered (Heb 5:8-

9).  How much more do we need to 

learn and mature, and some learning 

can only take place through 

suffering.
</p>
<p class='crb'>
So as a true Father, He loves us 

too much to take us out of the 

fray.  But there’s one thing we can 

be sure of--He’ll never leave us to 

fight our battles alone.
