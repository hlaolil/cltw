 	<h1>I Am who I Am</h1>
<h2>
Exodus 3:14
</h2>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>And God said to Moses, “I Am who I Am.” And He said, “Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, I Am has sent me to you".</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
And God said - Two names God would now be known by. A name that speaks what He is in Himself, I Am that I Am - This explains His name Jehovah, and signifies:<br><br> 
<b>First,</b> That He is self existent; He has His being of Himself, and has no dependence upon any other. And being self existent He cannot but be self sufficient, and therefore all - sufficient, and the inexhaustible fountain of being and bliss.<br><br>  
<b>Secondly,</b> That He is eternal and unchangeable, always the same, yesterday today, and for ever: He will be what He will be, and what He is.
<br><br>  
<b>Thirdly.</b> That He is faithful and true to all His promises, unchangeable in His word as well as in His nature, and not a man that He should lie. Let Israel know this, I Am has sent me to you. A name that speaks what He is to His people. Lest that name I Am should puzzle them, He is further directed to make use of another name of God, more familiar, The Lord God of your fathers.
