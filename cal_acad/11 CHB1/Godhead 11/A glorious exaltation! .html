 <h1>
A Glorious Exaltation! 
</h1>
<p>
God has highly exalted Jesus. 
To be highly exalted is a relative term. It suggests high exaltation but leaves room for others to be exalted even higher. The term used in the original is not relative but superlative. God has exalted Jesus to the highest possible position. First Jesus humbled Himself to the lowest degree. Then God exalted Him to a position no one else could ever occupy.
</p>
<h3>
God gave Jesus a Name 
</h3> 
<p>
In keeping with that, God gave Jesus a name that is above every name. 
We are not talking about a personal name that God gave to Jesus, such as the name that He gave to Jesus at His birth by divine revelation to Mary and Joseph.
</p> 
<p>
Rather "name" refers here to a title given to one reflecting the rank or position he occupies. Matthew 10:41 speaks of receiving a prophet in the name of a prophet. The idea is that one receives a prophet because he holds the position and title of a prophet.
</p>
<p>
God gave to Jesus a name that is above every name. Many occupy great positions and have titles to reflect that fact. To Jesus was given the highest position possible in the universe and a title that matched it. 
The name God gave Him is "Lord." This is indicated in that God highly exalted Jesus, so that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
</p>
<h3>
His exalted Lordship
</h3> 
<p>
The exalted Lordship of Jesus is recognised in many different passages of Scripture. According to I Timothy 6:15 Jesus <dr class='alt5'>"is the blessed and only Potentate, the King of kings and Lord of lords,"</dr class='alt5'> According to Romans 10:12 Jesus is lord over all and is rich to all them that call on Him. 
<br><br>
Ephesians 1:21-22 gives content to His great name. There we learn that God the Father set Jesus <dr class='alt5'>"far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come. And He put all things under His feet, and gave Him to be head over all things to the church,"</dr class='alt5'> 
</p>
<p><p class= "block"><dr class='alt3'>
That God exalted Jesus to be Lord over all means therefore that God gave to Jesus the entire universe as His own to possess. In addition, God gave Jesus both the power and the authority to rule over the universe on His behalf.</p> 
<p>
God elevated Jesus to such a high and lofty position, first, through His resurrection. On the third day after His crucifixion God raised Jesus from the dead. This was a most glorious resurrection. It was not a return to this life, as was the resurrection of Lazarus and others. It was an advancement forward. Through His resurrection, Jesus' body was made heavenly and spiritual, adapted to live forever in heaven.
</p> 
<p>
In keeping with the nature of Jesus' resurrection, God exalted Him to heaven forty days later. Jesus ascended to heaven in His glorified human body in the sight of His disciples from the Mount of Olives. This was a change of place for Jesus. According to His human nature He is no more on the earth but in heaven. 
</p>
<p>
At His ascension God seated Jesus at His own right hand. To be seated at the right hand of the king was to have a position second only to the king himself, and thus to be clothed with power and authority to rule the entire kingdom on behalf of the king. This was the position that Joseph occupied in Egypt. It was to this position that God the Father elevated Jesus upon His ascension, so that He became the King of all kings to rule the universe on behalf of the living God.

He who humbled Himself as no one else ever can or will has been exalted to a position higher than anyone else ever can or will attain.
