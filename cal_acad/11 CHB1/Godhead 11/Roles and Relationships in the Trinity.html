 	<h1>Roles and Relationships in the Trinity</h1>
<p>
The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are each fully God. They are each equally God. They each fully possess one undivided divine nature. Yet each Person of the Godhead is different in role and relationship with respect to the others. To distinguish the roles and relationships that exist in and among the triune Persons, we might say this: 
<ul>
<li>The Father is supreme in authority among the Persons of the Godhead, and he is responsible for devising the grand purposes and plans that take place through all of creation and redemption (see, for example, Eph 1:3, 9-11).</li>
<li>The Son is under the Father’s authority and seeks always to do the Father’s will. Although the Son is fully God, He nonetheless takes His lead from the Father and seeks to glorify the Father in all that He does (see, for example, John 8:28-29, 42).</li> 
<li>The Spirit is under both the Father and the Son. As the Son sought to glorify the Father in all he did, the Spirit seeks to glorify the Son, to the ultimate praise of the Father (see, for example, John 16:14; 1 Cor 12:3; Phil 2:11).</li></ul>
<p>
To understand how these roles are expressed, consider some of the works that God accomplishes. Often we think of these as the works of “God,” and rightly they are. Yet these are the works of the triune God, with the Father, Son, and Spirit each contributing to the whole of the work and together accomplishing all that God brings to pass.</p>
