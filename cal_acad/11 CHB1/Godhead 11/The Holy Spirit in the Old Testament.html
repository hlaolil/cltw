The Holy Spirit in the Old Testament
</h1>
<p>
The Holy Spirit was active during the Old Testament. At creation, we find that the Spirit of God was hovering above the waters. During the exodus from Egypt, the time of the first kings, and most notably during the ministry of the prophets, the Holy Spirit was active. But despite the wide ministry of the Holy Spirit during all of this period, what the Old Testament believers saw was just a small deposit of what was to come.
</p>
<p>
For example, in Num 11 we read that <dr class='alt5'>“I will take of the Spirit that is upon you and will put the same upon them ” (Num 11:17)</dr class='alt5'> (The “them” are Israel’s elders.) God did exactly what He promised, and <dr class='alt5'>“when the Spirit rested upon them, that they prophesied, although they never did so again.” (Num. 11:25)</dr class='alt5'> The narrator goes on to tell us that two elders, Eldad and Medad, were not with the others. <dr class='alt5'>“the Spirit rested upon them. ... yet they prophesied in the camp.” (Num. 11:26)</dr class='alt5'> Moses, brushing aside Joshua’s concerns, exclaimed, <dr class='alt5'>“... Oh, that all the Lord’s people were prophets and that the Lord would put His Spirit upon them!” (Num 11:29)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
This vignette from the Pentateuch illustrates perfectly the nature of the Holy Spirit’s presence in the Old Testament.
</p>
<p>
The event is exceptional: the Holy Spirit came on little more than a few hundred men in the thousands of years that encompass the Old Testament.
</p>
<p>
The event is transitory: the Holy Spirit came, then went.
</p><p>
And yet there was a hope (you might say a prophecy), that one day all of the Lord’s people would be prophets and the Lord would put His Spirit on them.
</p>
<h3>
Here today, gone tomorrow
</h3>
<p>
The historical books continue these themes. We read of the Spirit of the Lord coming up on selected leaders of God’s people, such as Othniel (Judges 3:10), Gideon (Judges 6:34), Jephthah (Judges 11:29), and others. Each time the spirit came, it came on just one man who immediately went on to complete a mighty act requiring power or wisdom, or to speak a prophetic word.<br> Occasionally the spirit would come on the same individual on more than one occasion. Samson had such an experience on at least three occasions <br>(Judges 14:6, 14:19, 15:14), as did Saul (1 Samuel 10:10, 11:6, 19:23).<br>
In the Psalms, the Holy Spirit is just fleetingly described. But we learn that the Spirit is synonymous with the presence of God (Psa 51:11, 139:7), and His work involves re-creation (Psa 104:30) and guidance (Psa 143:10).
</p>
<p>
It’s not until we get to the major prophets that we start to discover more. Isaiah speaks of the Spirit resting on the Messiah<dr class='alt5'> The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him, (Isa 11:2)</dr class='alt5'>. God confirms<dr class='alt5'> “I have put My Spirit upon Him;” (Isa 42:1)</dr class='alt5'>,<br> and later <dr class='alt5'>“My Spirit who is upon you, and My words which I have put in your mouth, shall not depart from your mouth,  ... ” (Isa 59:21).</dr class='alt5'> The Spirit also linked to the end of judgement and the beginning of blessing, as Isaiah prophesies of judgement which will continue <dr class='alt5'>“Until the Spirit is poured upon us from on high,” (Isa 32:15, cf. 44:3)</dr class='alt5'>. All this is a far cry from what’s gone before. Just look at the terrifically powerful verbs Isaiah uses. The Spirit who came and went from a handful of Israel’s leaders will rest on The Messiah, and be poured out on God’s people.
Ezekiel tells us that under the new covenant God’s people will have a new spirit (11:19, 36:26). We soon find out this is actually God’s Spirit (Ezek 36:27) who will bring holiness, and even life itself (Ezek 37:14).<br> Again God promises that <dr class='alt5'>“I shall have poured out My Spirit on the house of Israel”  (Ezek 39:29).</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
This cry is taken up by Joel (2:28-9) who adds more detail. This pouring out will produce prophecy, and will impact young and old, and even both male and female. Again, this is a long way from what has been experienced until then – tiny drops of the Spirit’s blessing impacting men (no women are explicitly said to have experienced the Spirit in the Old Testament), and only elders and leaders.
</p>
<p>
Clearly, God is going to do something big. But not yet. We must not rush into the New Testament without reminding ourselves that there is a four hundred year gap between Malachi and Matthew. Four hundred years characterised by one thing above all others: the complete absence of the Spirit. In the words of the Jewish Midrash ("commentary") “With the death of the last prophets Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi, the Holy Spirit departed from Israel”.
