   <h1>
Wrong Responses to the Holy Spirit
</h1>
<p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><dr class="alt5">
You always resist the Holy Spirit  (Acts 7:51).</dr class="alt5"> <br>  <dr class="alt5"> Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God  (Eph. 4:30)</dr class="alt5"> <dr class="alt5"> <br>Do not quench the Spirit. (1 Thess. 5:19)</dr class="alt5">
</dr class="alt5">
</p>
<p>
It is the will of God that we walk in daily dependence upon the Holy Spirit. It is God's desire that we seek Him for the fullness of the Spirit's work in and through our lives. Three wrong responses that undermine the will of God in our lives are resisting, grieving, and quenching the Spirit of the Lord.
</p>
<h2>
Resisting the Holy Spirit
</h2>
<p>
When Stephen was on trial before the religious leaders of Israel, he preached a powerful sermon declaring the faithfulness of God toward His consistently unfaithful nation. He concluded his message with a pointed, radical, accurate evaluation.<dr class="alt5"> "You stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears! You always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, so do you" (Acts 7:51)</dr class="alt5">. <br>Here we are given the kind of attitudes that oppose the work of the Spirit. These people were "stiff necked." They were stubborn and self-willed. They wanted their will, not the will of God. They also were "uncircumcised in heart and ears." They did not allow God to cut away the carnality of their inner being. They would not allow God to speak to them through His messengers. They were self-righteous and self-sufficient. When we conduct ourselves in this same manner, we also are "resisting the Holy Spirit."
</p>
<h2>
Grieving the Holy Spirit
</h2>
<p>
When Paul was writing to the church at Ephesus, he commanded them: <dr class="alt5"><br>"do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamour, and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice." (Ephesians 4:30-31)</dr class="alt5">. <br>Yes, the Holy Spirit is a person, not a mere power or influence. He can be saddened by our behaviour. When we, God's people, harbour bitterness in our hearts and malicious words in our mouths, then we are "grieving the Holy Spirit of God."
</p>
<h2>
Quenching the Holy Spirit
</h2>
<p>
When Paul wrote to the saints at Thessalonica, he instructed them: <dr class="alt5">"Do not quench the Spirit." (1 Thess 5:19)</dr class="alt5"> Just as a fire can be quenched, the promptings of the Holy Spirit can be stifled. As we read the word of God, the Spirit can be stirring a spiritual fire of conviction within us. Will we respond to that heavenly influence, or will we suppress it? When the Lord is igniting a vision of service unto Him, will we yield or will we extinguish it? When the Lord is calling us to intercessory prayer, will we cry out to Him or will we suppress that desire He is kindling? Will we allow the Spirit to blaze within our hearts, or will we "quench the Spirit?"
