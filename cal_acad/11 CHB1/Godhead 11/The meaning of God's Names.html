	<h1>The meaning of God's Names</h1>
	
	<p class='block'><dr class='alt2'>Each of the many names of God describes a different aspect of His many-faceted character. </p>
<h3>
Some of the better-known names of God in the Bible:</h3>
	
	<p><strong>EL, ELOAH</strong>: God "mighty, strong, prominent" (Gen 7:1; Isa 9:6) – etymologically, El appears to mean “power,” as in “I have the power to harm you” (Gen 31:29). El is associated with other qualities, such as integrity <br>(Num 23:19), jealousy (Deut 5:9), and compassion (Neh 9:31), but the root idea of might remains.</p>
	
	<p><strong>ELOHIM</strong>: God “Creator, Mighty and Strong” (Gen 17:7; Jer 31:33) – the plural form of Eloah, which accommodates the doctrine of the Trinity. From the Bible’s first sentence, the superlative nature of God’s power is evident as God (Elohim) speaks the world into existence (Gen 1:1).</p>
	
	<p><strong>EL SHADDAI</strong>: “God Almighty,” “The Mighty One of Jacob” <br>(Gen 49:24; Psa 132:2,5) – speaks to God’s ultimate power over all.</p>
	
	<p><strong>ADONAI</strong>: “Lord” (Gen 15:2; Judg 6:15) – used in place of YHWH, which was thought by the Jews to be too sacred to be uttered by sinful men. In the Old Testament, YHWH is more often used in God’s dealings with His people, while Adonai is used more when He deals with the Gentiles.</p>
	
	<p><strong>YHWH / YAHWEH / JEHOVAH</strong>: “LORD” (Deut 6:4; Dan 9:14) – strictly speaking, the only proper name for God. Translated in English Bibles “LORD” (all capitals) to distinguish it from Adonai, “Lord.” The revelation of the name is first given to Moses “I Am who I Am” (Ex 3:14). This name specifies an immediacy, a presence. Yahweh is present, accessible, near to those who call on Him for deliverance (Psa 107:13), forgiveness (Psa 25:11) and guidance (Psa 31:3).</p>
	
	<p><strong>YAHWEH-JIREH</strong>: "The Lord Will Provide" (Gen 22:14) – the name memorialised by Abraham when God provided the ram to be sacrificed in place of Isaac.</p>
	
	<p><strong>YAHWEH-RAPHA</strong>: "The Lord Who Heals" (Ex 15:26) – “I am Jehovah who heals you” both in body and soul. In body, by preserving from and curing diseases, and in soul, by pardoning iniquities.</p>
	
	<p><strong>YAHWEH-NISSI</strong>: "The Lord Our Banner" (Ex 17:15), where banner is understood to be a rallying place. This name commemorates the desert victory over the Amalekites in Ex 17.</p>
	
	<p><strong>YAHWEH-M'KADDESH</strong>: "The Lord Who Sanctifies, Makes Holy" <br>(Lev 20:8; Ezek 37:28) – God makes it clear that He alone, not the law, can cleanse His people and make them holy.</p>
	
	<p><strong>YAHWEH-SHALOM</strong>: "The Lord Our Peace" (Judg 6:24) – the name given by Gideon to the altar he built after the Angel of the Lord assured him he would not die as he thought he would after seeing Him.</p>
	
	<p><strong>YAHWEH-ELOHIM</strong>: "LORD God" (Gen 2:4; Psa 59:5) – a combination of God’s unique name YHWH and the generic “Lord,” signifying that He is the Lord of Lords.</p>
	
	<p><strong>YAHWEH-TSIDKENU</strong>: "The Lord Our Righteousness” (Jer 33:16) – As with YHWH-M’Kaddesh, it is God alone who provides righteousness to man, ultimately in the person of His Son, Jesus Christ, who became sin for us “that we might become the Righteousness of God in Him” (2 Cor 5:21).</p>
	
	<p><strong>YAHWEH-ROHI</strong>: "The Lord Our Shepherd" (Psa 23:1) – After David pondered his relationship as a shepherd to his sheep, he realised that was exactly the relationship God had with him, and so he declares, “Yahweh-Rohi is my Shepherd. I shall not want” (Psa 23:1).</p>
	
	<p><strong>YAHWEH-SHAMMAH</strong>: "The Lord Is There” (Ezek 48:35) – the name ascribed to Jerusalem and the Temple there, indicating that the once-departed glory of the Lord (Ezek 8 - 11) had returned (Ezek 44:1-4).</p>
	
	<p><strong>YAHWEH-SABAOTH</strong>: "The Lord of Hosts" (Isa 1:24; Psa 46:7) – Hosts means “hordes,” both of angels and of men. He is Lord of the host of heaven and of the inhabitants of the earth, of Jews and Gentiles, of rich and poor, master and slave. The name is expressive of the majesty, power, and authority of God and shows that He is able to accomplish what He determines to do.</p>
	
	<p><strong>EL ELYON</strong>: “Most High" (Deut 26:19) – derived from the Hebrew root for “go up” or “ascend,” so the implication is of that which is the very highest. El Elyon denotes exaltation and speaks of absolute right to Lordship.</p>
	
	<p><strong>EL ROI</strong>: "God of Seeing" (Gen 16:13) – the name ascribed to God by Hagar, alone and desperate in the wilderness after being driven out by Sarah (Gen 16:1-14). When Hagar met the Angel of the Lord, she realised she had seen God Himself in a theophany. She also realised that El Roi saw her in her distress and testified that He is a God who lives and sees all.</p>
	
	<p><strong>EL-OLAM</strong>: "Everlasting God" (Psa 90:1-3) – God’s nature is without beginning or end, free from all constraints of time, and He contains within Himself the very cause of time itself. “From everlasting to everlasting, You are God.”</p>
	
	<p><strong>EL-GIBHOR</strong>: “Mighty God” (Isa 9:6) – the name describing the Messiah, Christ Jesus, in this prophetic portion of Isaiah. As a powerful and mighty warrior, the Messiah, the Mighty God, will accomplish the destruction of God’s enemies and rule with a rod of iron (Rev 19:15).</p>
