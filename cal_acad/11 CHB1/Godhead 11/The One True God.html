   <h1>
The One True God
</h1>
<h3>
God and the gods of the world
</h3>
<p>
People are bowing down to many gods today, just as they did in the ancient pagan world. It was these idolaters to whom Paul proclaimed,<dr class='alt5'> "and that there is no other God but one. For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth (as there are many gods and many lords), yet for us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and through whom we live." (1 Cor 8:4-6).<dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
In the modern world, the atheistic evolutionist worships the great god Chance in the shrine of Darwinism, while New Age pantheistic evolutionists attribute everything to Father Time and Mother Earth. The materialistic social Darwinists pay homage to the god Mammon and modern feminists adore the goddess Sophia. Animists sacrifice to demonic spirits and Hindu worshippers honour a thousand divinities. Popular celebrities speak patronizingly of the Man Upstairs and Muslims fight in the name of Allah. There are "gods many and lords many." So how is one to know which "god" is the true God, the Creator, Sustainer, and Judge of the whole creation? Which "god" is the God who is real, the one able to provide eternal salvation and everlasting life?
</p>
<h3>
The God who is Real
</h3>
<p>
There is one infallible way to know—one sure test, and no other. The one God who can defeat death is the only God who can give life!<br>
This was Paul's message to the intellectuals of antiquity, and it must be our uncompromising message today. "<dr class='alt5'>and gives life to all things?
He has not left us to wander about in ignorance of this all-important truth.</dr class='alt5'> "because He has appointed a day on which He will judge the world in righteousness by the Man whom He has ordained. He has given assurance of this to all by raising Him from the dead" (Acts 17:31).
</p>
<h3>
Resurrection from the dead
</h3>
<p>
There is one Man—only one Man—in all human history who has defeated death, has died and then risen again, never to die again. Since only the Creator of life could ever defeat death, He must be both God and man, the God-man, eternal God and perfect man, "declared to be the Son of God with power . . . by the resurrection from the dead" (Romans 1:4)<br><br>
It is unfortunate that Easter has become so encumbered with many pagan notions (bunnies, eggs, spring festivals, etc.) and materialistic practices (Easter parades of spring fashions) that most people in western nations forget or ignore the grand truth that our Lord Jesus Christ is "risen from the dead, and has become the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep."<br> (I Corinthians 15:20).<br><br>
The death and resurrection of our Creator is no mere religious dogma requiring perfunctory attendance at church once a year, as many seem to think, but the most vital of all living realities. "I am He who lives, and was dead, and behold, I am alive for evermore. Amen. And I have the keys of Hades and of Death." (Revelation 1:18). Furthermore, the bodily resurrection of Christ can be shown to be the best-proved fact of history.
</p>
<p class='crb'>
The Lord Jesus Christ, whose resurrection we acknowledge, remembering the completion of both His work of creation and also His greater work of redemption, He is our great Creator, Saviour, risen Lord, and soon-coming King. "Blessed are all those who put their trust in Him." (Psalm 2:12).
