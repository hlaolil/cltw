<h1>
God the Father and Jesus
</h1>
<h3>
The Ultimate Father-Son Relationship?
</h3>
<p>
God is called by a variety of names in the Bible, and each one sheds light on an aspect of His nature. Jesus’ favourite title for Him was Father. Surprisingly, this name for God is used only 15 times in the Old Testament, but in the New Testament, it’s recorded 245 times!</p>
<p>
Many of God’s names speak of His majestic and lofty attributes that separate Him from mankind, but Father conveys intimacy. Jesus used this name not only because He was God’s Son, but also to help people realise that Jehovah isn’t some unapproachable Deity gazing down on them from a distance. Rather, He is their loving heavenly Father, who cares about them and wants to be involved in their everyday lives.</p>
<p>
Throughout His time on earth, Christ revealed by example what this kind of love relationship was like. He depended completely on His Father for daily direction, power, and provision and obediently carried out every instruction. He often left the demands of ministry just to find a secluded place to be alone with Jehovah. We know Jesus successfully conveyed the riches of this relationship to His disciples, because Philip said, <dr class='alt5'>“Lord, show us the Father” (John 14:8, )</dr class='alt5'>— he wanted to know Him the way Christ did.</p>
<p>
Do you long for that kind of intimacy with God? He wants to relate to you as a Father to His child, and He’s given you the privilege of drawing near to Him. In fact, He chose you before the foundation of the world and waits with open arms for you to enter His loving embrace.</p>
