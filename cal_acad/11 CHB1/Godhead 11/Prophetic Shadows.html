   <h1>Prophetic Shadows</h1>
<h3>
OT prophecy fulfilment and NT fulfilment
</h3>
<p>
From our vantage point today, we can also see how the Old Testament corresponds to the New Testament through miraculous Messianic prophecy fulfilment. Distinct aspects of the ancestry, birth, life, ministry, death and resurrection of the Messiah were all prophesied in the Old Testament and their historical fulfilment was recorded in the New Testament, primarily the four Gospels. The Old Testament points toward “the anointed one,” which was translated Christos in Greek, the language of the inspired New Testament Scripture and much of the Roman world. Therefore, Christ was the term used by Christians to refer to the Messiah.</p>
<h3>
Prophecy fulfilment
</h3>
<p>
Prophecy fulfilment is powerful evidence that validates the credibility and supernatural inspiration of the Old Testament, where human beings are told specific predictions by God to be fulfilled many hundreds of years in the future. While Christian apologists do not arrive at the same number of messianic prophecies, most agree they are numerous. Jewish biblical scholar Alfred Edersheim (1825-1889), a convert to Christianity, wrote a classic work affirming there are 456 passages in the Old Testament that refer to the Messiah. His work The Life and Times of Jesus The Messiah is accessible for free on-line at CCEL. Edersheim also stated that there are 558 Messianic references in Jewish rabbinic writings. Popular apologist Josh McDowell inspired a generation of Christians to become interested in prophecy fulfilment by detailing numerous prophecies in his best-seller Evidence That Demands A Verdict (first printing 1972).</p>
<p>
One of the better known prophecies says that <dr class='alt5'>“The One to be Ruler in Israel, whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting” (Micah 5:2)</dr class='alt5'> would be born in Bethlehem. In the New Testament, King Herod asked his chief priests and teachers of the law where the Messiah (or Christ) was to be born. They replied, “In Bethlehem of Judea,” specifically quoting Micah 5:2 (see Matthew 2:1-6).</p>
<p>
The Old Testament points toward Jesus as the Messiah or there will never be one – in other words, Jesus fits the “fingerprint” of the prophecies in a manner that nobody else ever did or will be able to do in the future, given the necessary time frame for the appearance of the Messiah.</p>
<p>
Keep in mind that Jesus Himself claimed He was fulfilling prophecy. In the Sermon on the Mount, He said He has not come to abolish the Law and the Prophets, a designation for the Old Testament Scriptures, but to fulfil them (Matthew 5:17). After His resurrection Jesus expounded to the disciples that, <dr class='alt5'>“These are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms concerning Me (Luke 24:44)”</dr class='alt5'></p>
<h3>
Foreshadowing
</h3>
<p>
While prophecy fulfilment is stunning, foreshadowing is a literary device that anticipates important future events. It demonstrates the beauty and drama of a sophisticated narrative. The world’s great writers use foreshadowing in their masterpieces. This is another captivating way that the Old Testament corresponds to the New Testament.<br> Hebrews states <dr class='alt5'>“For the law, having a shadow of the good things to come, and not the very image of the things.” (Hebrews 10:1)</dr class='alt5'>The fulfilment of these “types” occurs in the “good things” of the person and work of Jesus Christ, the “anti type (corresponding to something prior)” (Hebrews 10:5-14).</p>
<p>
One example an Old Testament “type” or shadow is Abraham, who initially was commanded to sacrifice his only legitimate son Isaac until God saw Abraham’s faithfulness and intervened with a substitutionary sacrifice (Genesis 22). The fulfilment or “anti type” is demonstrated when God the Father, who so loved the world, that He gave His one and only Son as a sacrifice for the sins of the world (e.g. John 3:16; Romans 3:22-25).</p>
<p>
Another “type” or foreshadowing of Christ is found in the Passover lamb (see Exodus 11-12). God was to deliver the tenth and final plague upon the land of Egypt, which was to strike the first born son of everyone in Egypt as well as livestock. However, God had a way of escape for the persecuted Israelites. They were to take the blood of a one-year-old lamb without defect and place it above and on both sides of the door frame of their home. God was to bring judgement upon Egypt for their worship of false gods, but when the Lord saw the blood on the door frame of the Israelites He would pass over and spare the lives of those inside.</p>
<p>
We see the New Testament “anti type” in 1 Corinthians which says <dr class='alt5'>“For indeed Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed for us” (1 Corinthians 5:7)</dr class='alt5'> for our deliverance by His atoning blood shed for our sins.</p>
