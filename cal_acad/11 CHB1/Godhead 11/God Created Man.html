   <h1> God created man</h1>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>
So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.(Genesis 1:27)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>
Created in the image of God
</h3> 
<p>
Which consisted both in the form of his body, and the erect stature of it, different from all other creatures; in agreement with the idea of that body, prepared in covenant for the Son of God, and which it was therein agreed He should assume in the fullness of time; and in the immortality of his soul, and in his intellectual powers, and in that purity, holiness, and righteousness in which he was created; as well as in his dominion, power, and authority over the creatures, in which he was as God's vice regent, and resembled Him. The Jerusalem Targum is,"the Word of the Lord created man in His likeness;"</p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>
 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through Him, and without Him nothing was made that was made. ( John 1:1-3 John 1:14 ) </dr class='alt5'>
</p>

<p>
<dr class='alt5'>in the image of God created He him;</dr class='alt5'>
which is repeated for the certainty of it, and that it might be taken notice of, as showing man's superior glory and dignity to the rest of the creatures,</p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>For a man indeed ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man.( 1 Cor 11:7 ) </dr class='alt5'></p>
<h3>
God created man and woman
</h3>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>male and female He created  them;</dr class='alt5'>
not that man was created an hermaphrodite, or with two bodies, back to back united together, and afterwards cleaved asunder, as the Jews fabulously say; but first God made man, or the male, out of the dust of the earth, and infused a rational soul into him; and then out of one of his ribs made a female, or woman, who was presented to him as his wife, that so their species might be propagated; and only one male and one female were created, to show that hereafter a man was to have at a time no more wives than one; see ( Malachi 2:15 ) ( Matthew 19:4 ) for all that is said in the following chapter, concerning the formation of man out of the dust of the earth, and the making of woman out of his rib, and presenting her to him, and his taking her to be his wife, were all done on this sixth day, and at this time.</p>
<p><p class='block'><dr class='alt'>  The Jews give these reasons why man was made on the evening of the Sabbath, to show that he did not assist in the work of creation; and that if he was elated in his mind, it might be told to him that a fly was created before him.</p>
