   <h1>
The Fivefold Ministry Gifts
</h1>
<p>
In Ephesians 4:11-13, Paul shifts from teaching about gifts given to individuals (see 1 Corinthians 12 and Romans 12) to gifted individuals given to the church, namely, apostles, prophets, 

evangelists, pastors, and teachers.
</p>
<p>
The Fivefold Ministry, as God designed it to work, was not having one person functioning in five offices or capacities, rather, it is five people working together, each of whom has a specific anointing 

to serve in one of the offices listed in Ephesians 4:11-13.  When the right people with right hearts are in the right offices, the container is ready for Jesus to fill it with the oil of the Holy Spirit.  The 

outcome is that the church moves toward spiritual maturity (Ephesians 4:13-16).
</p>
<p>
Let’s say a bit more about each of the five offices with an extended emphasis on the office of apostle.
</p>
<h2>
Apostles
</h2>
<p>
Biblical examples of Apostles / apostles:
<ul>
<li>Jesus (Hebrews 3:1)
</li>
<li>The twelve (Luke 6:13)
</li>
<li>Paul (1 Cor. 1:1; Ephesians 1:1)
</li>
<li>Messengers (lit.: apostles) of the churches (2 Cor. 8:23)
</ul>
</li>
</p>
<p>
The word apostle signifies “someone who is sent forth by another person often with a special commission to represent that person and to accomplish his work.” 
<ul>
<li>An apostle is like a delegate, commissioner, or ambassador who is sent out on a mission with the authority of the one who sent him or her.
</li>
<li>
An apostle is a “person who is sent out by a king or ruler to his subjects, or, more often, to a foreign power, as his personal representative bearing his full powers.”
</li>
Strong parallels exist between the spiritual gift of leadership and apostleship.
</p></ul>
<h3>
Protest
</h3>
<p>
As soon as we begin to talk about apostles, someone protests saying, "Apostles no longer exist in our day because no one in our day has personally seen the risen Christ and no one is writing 

documents that are on a par with Scripture, i.e., documents that must be added to the 66 books of the Canon.  Scripture is complete.  Hence, we look to it, not to apostles and prophets".
</p>
<p>
Yes, the canon of Scripture is complete.  Nevertheless, we must ask, “In our day is God calling / equipping / gifting / appointing / anointing men and women to serve as apostles?”
<ul>
<li>Technically, “No.”
The original 12 Apostles were unique in that they witnessed Christ’s resurrection (Acts 1:22) and wrote the very words of God (see Luke 10:16).
</li>
<li>
Functionally, “Yes.”
In our day Jesus continues to call / anoint / appoint / commission men and women to function in roles parallel to NT apostles.  Men and women cannot appoint themselves to this role. Neither can a 

congregation by democratic process vote them into this anointing.  Rather, apostles must be called, appointed, and anointed by God Himself to wear this mantle.  Alert congregations will affirm 

God’s anointing.
</li>
<p></ul>
<p>
I find it helpful to delineate three tiers of apostles:
<ul>
<li>
Jesus – in a class all by Himself
</li>
<li>
The Twelve Apostles plus Paul
</li>
<li>
Historic and modern-day apostles – called by God and anointed to function in roles and capacities similar to the original Twelve
</li>
</p></ul>
<h3>
New Church Plants
</h3>
<p>
Modern day apostles function with a high degree of spiritual authority.  In addition to evangelising, preaching, and teaching, they exercise significant authority in matters pertaining to church planting, 

church order, church discipline, church government, and mission advancement locally and globally.  Along with prophets, they initiate (launch) new ministries (Eph. 2:18-22) and set-in-order existing 

ministries (Titus 1:5).  Their powerful words are backed by powerful deeds including miracles and deliverances (Romans 15:18-19).
</p>
<p>
Even though the average denomination sends out teachers and worship leaders to plant churches, by God’s design we would be wiser to send anointed apostles and prophets to launch new works 

(Eph. 2:18-22).
</p>
<h3>
Hierarchy of Leadership
</h3>
<p>
God appoints apostles to serve as key leaders of ministries, churches, and denominations.  Every ministry must take seriously the hierarchy of leadership prescribed by God in 1 Cor 12 <dr class='alt5'>

“God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers …,” (1 Cor. 12:28) </dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>
Practically, how might this work in a local church?
</h3>
<p>
Apostles tweak job descriptions, establish priorities, discipline erring members, and appoint qualified co-workers to lead particular ministries.  In short, they set things in order.
</p>
<h3>
Council of Elders
</h3>
<p>
We suggest that each local church be governed by a Council of Elders and that the Council includes an apostle, prophet, evangelist, pastor, and teacher.  Most of the time the Council functions by 

consensus: they prayerfully discuss issues and agree together on plans and procedures.  Every once in a while they will reach an impasse and a decision must be made.  But who is to make the 

final call?  According to 1 Cor. 12:28, not the congregation; rather, the apostle.  The buck stops with the apostle.  If the Council of Elders does not include a true apostle – and unfortunately, false 

apostles exist, 2 Cor. 11:13; Rev. 2:2 – a prophet makes the final call.  If neither an apostle nor a prophet is properly positioned on the church’s leadership team, the ministry’s primary teacher 

makes the final decision.
</p>
<p>
Another approach is this: Many congregations may not have an apostle in their midst but may be connected to an individual who serves in an apostolic role over several congregations.  This, too, is 

a workable arrangement.  Some of the best denominational leaders have an apostolic anointing.
</p>
<p>
The Biblical assumption is this:  When a godly apostle is in place, he or she will properly order the remainder of the church.  In cooperation with the prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers – 

and the Body – apostles manage resources in a manner that honours God, builds-up the church, and advances the gospel.
</p>
<h3>
Accountability
</h3>
<p>
Apostles are not to serve as lone rangers. Jesus expects apostles to work together with prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers – like five fingers on a hand – to equip people in the 

congregation for the work of service.  The Holy Spirit orchestrates the synergism.
</p>
<p>
Because the role of the apostle is neither understood nor appreciated by the average parishioner, we have devoted more time to describing it.   We now turn to the remaining four offices. These 

descriptions are brief – embarrassingly brief.  Nevertheless, this overview will be helpful.
</p>
<h2>
Prophets
</h2>
<p>
Prophets are the Body’s eyes and ears.  Under the guidance of the Holy Spirit they see and hear what God has done, is doing, and will do.  According to 1 Cor. 14:3, prophets speak to:
<ul>
<li>
Build up
</li>
<li>
Stir up
</li>
<li>
Cheer up
</li></ul>
<p>
Prophets speak an immediate word from the Lord.  Often God uses them to call sinners to repentance; to communicate vision and direction; and to exhort people to follow Jesus.
</p>
<h2>
Evangelists
</h2>
<p>
Evangelists love sharing the gospel!  … and when they do, people get saved!  Evangelists see Jesus Christ as the solution to every person’s problems.  Frequently signs and wonders accompany 

their ministries, authenticating their message about Jesus Christ.
</p>
<h2>
Pastors
</h2>
<p>
Good pastors are like Golden Retrievers: they love everybody!  They form friendships that last a lifetime.  Pastors [a.k.a., shepherds] love, feed, encourage, protect, and care for the flock.
</p>
<h2>
Teachers
</h2>
<p>
Teachers explain and clarify truth.  They have an amazing capacity to take complex subjects and make them simple resulting in a strong foundation and deep roots in the Word of God.  Long live 

godly teachers!
</p>
<p>
Frequently the person who serves as a church’s pastor is actually better suited for one of the other offices.  For example, often the pastor of a Baptist church is really an evangelist; the pastor of a 

Bible church is a teacher; and, the pastor of a charismatic church is a prophet.
</p>
<h3>
Summary
</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Apostles represent God’s authority.  They plant new churches and set existing churches in order.
</li>
<li>
Prophets share God’s vision.
</li>
<li>
Evangelists release God’s power to save.
</li>
<li>
Pastors provide godly care.
</li>
<li>
Teachers present truth.
</li></ul>
</p>
<p> 
Peter Wagner presents a somewhat humorous perspective regarding what might happen if any one of the people in these offices is left to work alone.
<ul>
<li>
A pure evangelist left to him or herself will build a large but shallow church, the classic mile wide but inch-deep.
</li>
<li>
A pure pastor left to him or herself will produce a church of people with deep relationships but who don’t have enough vision to find their way out the door.
</li>
<li>
A pure apostle will produce a chaotic church because he or she is never there; he or she is always travelling about, being in transit-local.
</li>
<li>
A pure teacher will turn the church into a lecture hall or academy.
</li>
<li>
And the prophet?  The prophet’s church is usually a small group of well-beaten sheep.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
But!  When the five work together in unity under the authority of Jesus Christ, empowered by the Holy Spirit, remarkable growth happens for the glory of God.  They build the containers into which 

Jesus may pour the oil of the Holy Spirit, and the oil continues to flow as long as the container remains essentially whole and holy.
</p>
<p>
Here is a picture of how the Fivefold Ministry might look in real life in a local church.  Picture a series of concentric circles.
<ul>
<li>
Centre Circle:  Jesus Christ
</li>
<li>
Holy Spirit, fivefold ministry, five fold ministry, church structure, church leadership, church government
</li>
<li>
Circle Two:  Council of Elders which includes at least one Elder serving in each of the five offices.  Depending on the size of the congregation some Elders may be part-time or full-time paid staff.
</li>
<li>
Circle Three:  Deacons.  The Deacons are Ministry Teams and Ministry Teams are Deacons  – people who do the work of ministry.  For example, the Worship Ministry Team; the Building and 

Grounds Ministry Team; the Children’s Ministry Team; etc.  All serve together with humility and joy empowered by the Holy Spirit for the glory of God to advance the gospel.  Depending on the size of 

the congregation some Ministry Teams may be led by part-time or full-time paid staff.
</li>
<li>
Circle Four: The Congregation
</li>
<li>
Circle Five:  The Community
</li>
<li>
Circle Six:  The Nation
</li>
<li>
Circle Seven:  The World
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Please recognise that this is an outline that leaves many questions unanswered such as:
What is the relationship between the Council of Elders and the Deacons?
What is the congregation’s role?
Does this church have a senior pastor?
Who selects new Elders and hires staff?
How does discipleship and spiritual formation happen?
