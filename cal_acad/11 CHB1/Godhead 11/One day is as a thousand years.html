   <h1>  One day is as a thousand years</h1>

<p>
<dr class='alt5'>
But, beloved, do not forget this one thing, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. (2 Peter 3:8)
</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>
Answering the objection of scoffers 
</h3>
<p>
 This 2 Peter 3:8 is the second consideration by which the apostle meets the objection of scoffers against the doctrine of the second coming of the Saviour. The objection was, that much time, and perhaps the time which had been supposed to be set for His coming, had passed away, and still all things remained as they were. <br>The reply of the apostle is, that no argument could be drawn from this, for that which may seem to be a long time to us is a brief period with God. In the infinity of His own duration there is abundant time to accomplish His designs, and it can make no difference with Him whether they are accomplished in one day or extended to one thousand years.</p>
<h3>
Man's time and God's time 
</h3>
<p> Man has but a short time to live, and if he does not accomplish his purposes in a very brief period, he never will. But it is not so with God. He always lives; and we cannot therefore infer, because the execution of His purposes seem to be delayed, that they are abandoned. With Him who always lives it will be as easy to accomplish them at a far distant period from now.<br> If it is His pleasure to accomplish them in a single day, He can do it; if He chooses that the execution shall be deferred to one thousand years, or that one thousand years shall be consumed in executing them, He has power to carry them onward through what seems, to us, to be so vast a duration. The wicked, therefore, cannot infer that they will escape because their punishment is delayed; nor should the righteous fear that the divine promises will fail because ages pass away before they are accomplished. The expression here used, that <dr class='alt5'>"one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, etc.,"</dr class='alt5'> is common in the Rabbinical writings.</p>
<p> 

A similar thought occurs in Psalms 90:4; <dr class='alt5'>"For a thousand years in Your sight are like yesterday when it is past, and like a watch in the night."</dr class='alt5'></p>
