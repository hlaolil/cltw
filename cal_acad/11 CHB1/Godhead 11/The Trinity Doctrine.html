 	<h1>The Trinity Doctrine</h1>  
<p>
The Doctrine of the Trinity teaches that within the unity of the one Godhead there are three separate persons who are coequal in power, nature, and eternity. This doctrine is derived from the clear teaching of Scripture, and is not a man-made doctrine as some (such as the Jehovah's Witnesses) have claimed. Let us briefly examine some of the New Testament evidences for this important doctrine.</p>
<p>
<h3>The Incarnation</h3>
<p>
The birth of the Lord Jesus Christ as described in the accounts in Matthew and Luke show that the doctrine of the Trinity was not a later invention of theologians. Luke records what an angel said to Mary:<dr class='alt5'> "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God" (Luke 1:35).</dr class='alt5'>
Since other passages of Scripture reveal that the term "Most High" refers to God the Father, we have in Luke a concrete instance of the Holy Spirit, the Father, and the Son all being mentioned together in the supernatural event of the Incarnation.</p>
<p>
<h3>The Baptism of Our Lord.</h3>
<p> 
When Jesus Christ was baptised, the heavens opened and the Holy Spirit <dr class='alt5'>"descended in bodily form like a dove upon Him, and a voice came from heaven which said, “You are My beloved Son; in You I am well pleased" (Luke 3:21-22).</dr class='alt5'> <br>In these verses we see the Son being baptised, the Spirit descending upon Him, and the Father bearing testimony.</p>
<p>
<h3>Discourses of Christ.</h3>
<p>
In John 14 Christ speaks of the persons of the Trinity in His Upper Room Discourse. Jesus declared to the disciples, <dr class='alt5'>"And I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may abide with you forever — the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He dwells with you and will be in you"<br> (John 14:16-17).</dr class='alt5'></p> <p>Our Lord here prays to the Father for the Spirit, and His emphasis on triunity is quite apparent. In John 14:26 and 15:26 Christ uses the same formula, mentioning the three persons of the Deity and indicating their unity, not only of purpose and will but of basic nature.</p>
<p>
<h3>Paul's Letters.</h3>
<p> 
The apostle Paul definitely taught the triune nature of God. He wrote: <dr class='alt5'><br>"The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all" (2 Cor. 13:14).</dr class='alt5'> It would have been difficult for Paul to give this benediction if the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were not equal persons within the Godhead.</p>
<p>
<h3>The Great Commission.</h3>
<p>
In Matthew 28 the Lord Jesus commissions the disciples to go out and preach the gospel and to make disciples of all nations. He commands them also to baptise <dr class='alt5'>"in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit." <br>(Matt 28:19)</dr class='alt5'> <br>Taken with the other passages bearing on the subject, this becomes an extremely powerful argument for the Christian doctrine of the Trinity.</p>
<p>
<h3>Creation.</h3>
<p>  
Although the Bible does not explain to us how the three persons are the one God, it tells us most emphatically that the Spirit of God created the world (Gen. 1:2), the Father created the world (Heb. 1:2), and the Son created the world (Col. 1:16). If you check the creation references in the New Testament, you will see that these particular references are bolstered by several others teaching the same things.</p>
<p>
The apostle Paul declared in Acts 17, <dr class='alt5'>"God, who made the world and everything in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands" (Acts 17:24)</dr class='alt5'> This forces us to an irresistible conclusion. As creation has been attributed to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit singly and collectively, they are the one God. There cannot be three gods. The Scripture declares: <dr class='alt5'>"Look to Me, and be saved, all you ends of the earth! For I am God, and there is no other" (Isa. 45:22).</dr class='alt5'> <br>Hence there is unity in trinity and trinity in unity.</p>
<p>
<h3>The Resurrection of Christ.</h3>
<p> 
A final instance of Trinitarian emphasis is that of the resurrection of our Lord. In John 2 Christ declared to the Jews, <dr class='alt5'>"Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up" (John 2:19)</dr class='alt5'>. John tells us that Jesus was speaking of the resurrection of His earthly body - <dr class='alt5'>He was speaking of the temple of His body. (John 2:21).</dr class='alt5'> Other Scriptures, however, state that Christ was raised by the agency of the Holy Spirit (e.g., Rom. 8:11). And Peter explicitly states that the Father raised the Son (Acts 3:26). So, again, God's Word affirms the triune nature of God.</p>
<p>
We may not fully understand the great truth of the Trinity. However, we can see the rays of light which emanate from God's Word and which teach us that, in a mysterious sense beyond the comprehension of man's finite mind, God is one in nature but three in person.</p>
