 <h1> Am I a God near at hand</h1>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>“Am I a God near at hand,” says the Lord, “and not a God afar off? Jeremiah 23:23</dr class='alt5'></p>
<h2>
Where is God
</h2>
<p>
Is God near at hand; that is, in heaven; and only sees, and hears, and observes persons and things there, being near to Him and not a God far away? who sees, and hears, and takes notice of persons and things at a distance, even on earth.</p>
<p>
The meaning is, that He certainly is; and that persons and things on earth are as much under His eye and notice, as persons and things in heaven; which was quite contrary to the notions of these atheistic prophets and people; who, like Heathens, thought that God did not concern Himself about persons and things on earth.</p>
<p> 
God is as near in one place as He is in another; which is a very great truth; and a very comfortable one it is to the people of God, to whom He is near in all places, and at all times; He is a present help in time of trouble; He is near them, to hear their cries, and grant their requests; He is near to give them assistance in a time of need, and to deliver them out of all their troubles; to afford them His gracious presence, and to indulge them with communion with Himself; to communicate all good things to them; to speak comfortably to them; to take them by the hand, and lead them in the way everlasting.</p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>
“For what great nation is there that has God so near to it, as the Lord our God is to us, for whatever reason we may call upon Him?" ( Deuteronomy 4:7 )</dr class='alt5'><br>
Though He may seem at times to be afar off, and stand at a distance from them; when He hides His face; withdraws His gracious influences; and does not appear at once for their relief in distress; but suffers them to be afflicted in one way or another. <BR>Yet in reality He is not; but is near them when they call upon Him: and this truth is as uncomfortable and dreadful to wicked men, who cannot go from His spirit, or flee from His presence; which is everywhere, in heaven and hell, in the earth and seas, even in the uttermost parts of them; there His eye is upon them, and His right hand can reach them:<p class='block'><dr class='alt3'>He is omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipotent. </p>
