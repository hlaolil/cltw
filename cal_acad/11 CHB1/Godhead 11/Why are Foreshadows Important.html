   <h1>Why are Foreshadows Important</h1> 
<p>
<h3>Foreshadows Link the whole Bible into a Big Picture of God.</h3>
<p>
A continuity of biblical principals (precepts) and spiritual dynamics exists from one book of the Bible to the other books of the Bible. A continuity that forms an important big picture and makes one thing certain - although the Word of God is divinely inspired and documented by many men over many years, there was only one Author.</p>
<p>
As one reads and increases Biblical knowledge, this continuity of scripture concerning the redemptive work of God through Christ is revealed. This continuity is amplified through revelations from Old Testament foreshadows. Therefore, all of God's work recorded in the Old Testament will metaphorically reflect "us in Christ" and form scripture continuity.</p>
<p>
For instance, when one reads the book of Isaiah, a prophet who died around 680 BC, he wrote about the Messiah in Isa 53 <br> <dr class='alt5'> ... He was wounded for our transgressions, (Isa 53:5) </dr class='alt5'> and <dr class='alt5'>... He was cut off from the land of the living.(Isa 53:8)</dr class='alt5'></p> <p>Then in the book of Daniel, which was written around 530 BC (150 years later), Daniel also saw the Messiah being cut off. Isaiah prophesied about the crucifixion event, and 150 years later Daniel added prophetic time allocated for the crucifixion in Dan 9.
<br>
<dr class='alt5'> “Seventy weeks are determined for your people and for your holy city, to finish the transgression, to make an end of sins,
to make reconciliation for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness,to seal up vision and prophecy, and to anoint the Most Holy.
“Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the command to restore and build Jerusalem until Messiah the Prince, there shall be seven weeks and sixty-two weeks; The street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublesome times. “And after the sixty-two weeks Messiah shall be cut off, but not for Himself;... (Dan 9:24-26)</p>
<p>
Daniel prophesied in verse 25 and 26 From the date of the issuing of the decree to rebuild Jerusalem the Anointed One (the Messiah) would come and be cut off (die) after seven sevens (49 years) and sixty-two sevens (434 years). We know for certain that this prophecy of 483 years was fulfilled on the date Christ was crucified.</p>
<p>
Daniel's prophecy builds on Isaiah's prophecy by providing a time when the Messiah would be crucified (cut off) - at the end of the sixty-ninth week.</p>
<p>
In the book of John, which was written around 85 AD (765 years after the book of Isaiah), John saw the prophecy of Isaiah 53:5 fulfilled as the Messiah was pierced for our transgressions in John 19 -<br> <dr class='alt5'> ... one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.(John 19:34)</p> <p>Additionally, John records the crucifixion as a fulfilment of another prophesy from the book of Zechariah...<br><dr class='alt5'> For these things were done that the Scripture should be fulfilled, (John 19:36) <br> <dr class='alt5'> "then they will look on Me whom they pierced." - Zech 12:10.</p>
<p>
The continuity of these prophesies from Isaiah to Daniel to Zechariah to John makes the continuity of scripture far more important than the identity of those who wrote the books. These scriptures reveal the hand of God at work inspiring men of God with words to record, so that in generations to come believers would know two things for certain -</p><p> 
<font size="+1"><font color="firebrick"> Jesus is Israel's Messiah</p></font></font> 
<p>
<font color="firebrick"> The Bible is the Word of God, authored by God, Himself. Only God could have orchestrated these events to occur on a specific time table. Man is not capable of authoring prophecy and fulfilling prophesy when fulfilment is required many hundreds of years later.</font></font>
<p> 
<h3>Foreshadows</h3> 
<p>
Old Testament historical events are another way the Old Testament foreshadows events taking place in the time of the New Testament.</p>
<p>
One of the Greatest Foreshadows in the Bible is Another Historical Event.<br>
One of the more meaningful foreshadows is seen in Ex 12:1-14. These scriptures are concerned with God's command to prepare the sacrificial lamb to be eaten on the day of the Lord's Passover (Ex 12:11). The Passover meal is a part of the Feast of Unleavened Bread (Ex 12:17) which is celebrated to commemorate the time God brought (saved) Israel out of bondage to slavery in Egypt. <br>This ordinance of celebration was for the generations to come (Ex 12:14). Is this is a foreshadow of Messiah who would come and save Israel from bondage to sin in a land of darkness ruled by the prince of darkness? The scripture does not say this is a foreshadow, but in hindsight we can see it is a shadow of Christ's death, shedding His blood for the forgiveness of sin which breaks bondage to death.</p>
<p>
<h3>Validation of the foreshadow</h3>
<p>
Moses applied the blood of the Passover lamb to the entry of the house. This blood caused the death angel to passover this man's home and his family. For this man and his family, life overcame death through faith in God's command. The blood of the lamb saved this man and his family.</p> 
<p>
This event, commemorated for the generations to come, was a foreshadow of an event to transpire in a future time. This foreshadow was fulfilled on the very same day, approximately 1475 years later (Luke 22:7). Jesus finished praying and the Passover meal was complete. Jesus left the upper room with His disciples and crossed the Kidron Valley and entered the Garden of Gethsemane to pray (John 18:1). It was on the night of the Passover meal that Jesus was arrested and He surrendered Himself into the hands of darkness to be the Sacrificial Lamb of God -</p>
