<h1>
Jesus Christ<br> Humiliation and Exaltation
</h1>
<p>
Though the human nature of Christ was at all times the same essentially, Christ was not at all times in the same state.  According to His human nature He lived up to His human nature. He was for a certain period of time in the state of humiliation, and from a certain time in the state of exaltation.<br><dr class='alt5'>Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bond servant, and coming in the likeness of men. Philippians 2:5-7.</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h4>
What was Christ's state of humiliation?
</h4>
<p>
Christ's state of humiliation includes the time from His conception to His resurrection from the dead, during which He refrained from the full and constant use of His divine power, majesty, glory and other attributes.
<br><dr class='alt5'>"For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet for your sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich."  (2 Cor 8:9).</dr class='alt5'>
</p> 
<h3>
Why didn't Christ use His full divine majesty?
</h3>
<p>
In order to complete the work of redemption through His suffering and death in our behalf. 
If He had always and fully used His divine majesty, He could not have become our Substitute and have suffered and died in our behalf.
</p>
<h4>
What are the stages of Christ's humiliation? 
</h4>
<p>
The stages of Christ's humiliation were His conception, birth, suffering, death, and burial.
</p>
<h3> 
The Conception of Christ
</h3>
<p>
Jesus' conception occurred in a miraculous, non-sexual manner. The Holy Spirit caused Mary to conceive God Incarnate without the help of a man. She also gave birth to Him miraculously; He passed through her without wounding her or spoiling her physical virginity.<br>
<dr class='alt5'>"And the angel answered and said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God. (Luke 1:35)</dr class='alt5'> <br><dr class='alt5'>Then Mary said, “Behold the maidservant of the Lord! Let it be to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her" - (Luke 1:38).</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>
The Birth of Christ
</h3>
<p>
The birth of Christ, the God-man, was a truly natural birth in great poverty.  It occurred at a time and place predicted by the prophets.  Christ, true God and man, was made under the law in the form of a servant and in the likeness of man, that men might be made the children of God.
<dr class='alt5'>"And she brought forth her first born Son, and wrapped Him in swaddling cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the inn." (Luke 2:7).<dr class='alt5'> 
</p>
<h3>
The Suffering of Christ
</h3>
<p>
The suffering of Christ, the God-man, was a real suffering of body and soul, in obedience to the Father's will, that He might make atonement for our sins and earn for us eternal joy.
<dr class='alt5'>"For Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit, "  (1 Peter 3:18)</dr class='alt5'>.<br> 
<dr class='alt5'>"Surely He has borne our griefs And carried our sorrows; Yet we esteemed Him stricken, Smitten by God, and afflicted."  (Isaiah 53:4).</dr class='alt5'> 
</p>
<h3>
The Death of Christ
</h3>
<p>
The death of Christ, the God-man, a shameful death on the cross, was a violent separation of body and soul.  However, the personal union of God and man in Christ remained.  His body and soul continued the personal union with the divine nature of the Son of God.
<dr class='alt5'>"He was taken from prison and from judgement, And who will declare His generation? For He was cut off from the land of the living; For the transgressions of My people He was stricken.And they made His grave with the wicked— But with the rich at His death, Because He had done no violence, Nor was any deceit in His mouth."  (Isaiah 53:8-9).</dr class='alt5'> <br>
<dr class='alt5'>And when Jesus had cried out with a loud voice, He said, “Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit.” Having said this, He breathed His last.   (Luke 23:46).</dr class='alt5'> 
</p>
<h3> 
The Burial of Christ
</h3>
<p>
Christ's body was laid in Joseph's sepulchre, while His soul was in Paradise.  This confirmed the fact of His death and its continuance to the third day.  During this time, however, corruption did not touch His body.
</p>
<h4>
What is the state of Christ's exaltation?
</h4>
<p>
The state of Christ's exaltation is that state in which Christ according to His human nature laid aside the weakness of His flesh and took up full and constant use of His divine attributes.
<dr class='alt5'>"Him God has exalted to His right hand to be Prince and Saviour,"  (Acts 5:31).</dr class='alt5'> 
<br><dr class='alt5'>"Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name,"  (Philippians 2:9).</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h4>
What are the stages of Christ's exaltation?
</h4>
 <p>
They are His descent into hell; His resurrection; His ascent into heaven ; His sitting at the right hand of God, and His coming again to judge the quick and the dead.
</p>
<h3>
Christ's descent into hell
</h3>
<p>
The Scriptures teach that Christ, having been made alive, descended into hell, not to suffer, but to proclaim His victory over His enemies.
<dr class='alt5'>"For Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive by the Spirit, 19 by whom also He went and preached to the spirits in prison,"  (1 Peter 3:18-19).</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3> 
Christ's Resurrection
</h3>
<p>
On the third day, Christ victoriously arose from the grave and showed Himself alive to His disciples.
<dr class='alt5'>"He is risen; He is not here: behold the place where they laid Him."  (Mark 16:6).</dr class='alt5'><br> 
<dr class='alt5'>"And if Christ is not risen, then our preaching is empty and your faith is also empty. Yes, and we are found false witnesses of God, because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ, whom He did not raise up—if in fact the dead do not rise. For if the dead do not rise, then Christ is not risen. And if Christ is not risen, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins!"  (1 Corinthians 15:14-17).</dr class='alt5'> 
</p>
<h3> 
Christ's Ascension into heaven
</h3>
<p>
The Scriptures teach that Christ, according to His human nature, withdrew His visible presence from His disciples and entered into the glory of His father as our forerunner.
<dr class='alt5'>"Now it came to pass, while He blessed them, that He was parted from them and carried up into heaven."  (Luke 24:51).</dr class='alt5'><br> 
<dr class='alt5'>"Now when He had spoken these things, while they watched, He was taken up, and a cloud received Him out of their sight." - (Acts 1:9).</dr class='alt5'> 
</p>
<h3> 
Christ's sitting at the right hand of God
</h3>
<p>
Christ received honour and glory and praise, that continues forever, that had not been His before as the God-man but also His seating at God's right hand indicated that He had been enthroned as ruler of the universe. The right hand of God is a position of authority and rule. It is the top position of authority in the universe. "The right hand of God is metaphorical language for divine omnipotence and omnipresence, and it affirms that Christ is reigning everywhere as king and Lord, wielding the power of divine authority." 
<dr class='alt5'>"which He worked in Christ when He raised Him from the dead and seated Him at His right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality and power and might and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this age but also in that which is to come. And He put all things under His feet, and gave Him to be head over all things to the church," (Ephesians 1:20-22).</dr class='alt5'> 
</p>
<h3> 
Christ's coming to judgement
</h3>
<p>
On the last day, which is appointed by God, but unknown to men, Christ will return visibly and in glory, and judge the world in righteousness by His Word. Essentially the future kingdom will consist, like that of the present, in the rule of God established and acknowledge in the hearts of men," however at that time all of the opposition will be destroyed. No more will there be rebel forces opposing the kingdom.<dr class='alt5'>The Lord said to my Lord,“Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies Your footstool.” (Psalm 110:1).</dr class='alt5'><br> Thus, while all things, wicked and good, are now subject to Christ ("Sit at my right hand") one day God and Christ will have fully eliminated everything that does not gladly submit to Christ's spiritual kingship ("until I make Thine enemies a footstool for Thy feet"). The universal kingship and spiritual kingship of Christ will thus be one, for all of Christ's enemies will have been judged and consigned to hell, and everybody who passes the judgement through faith in Him will then live forever in perfect obedience to Christ's moral will -- which is the same as saying that Christ's universal kingship will then be the same as His spiritual kingship. His sovereign will and His moral will, will be the same. 
</p>
<h4> 
The importance of Christ's Resurrection from the dead
</h4>
<p>
It proves definitely and beyond doubt that Christ in the Son of God. 
<dr class='alt5'>"and declared to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead." (Romans 1:4).</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3> 
His doctrine is the truth.
</h3>
<p> 
The doctrine of Christ is the sum total of all His teaching and it is given to us in the New Testament. When we act without any sanction or approval from Christ and His apostles, we "go beyond the doctrine of Christ" and lose our fellowship with God. God drew that line around the doctrine and prescribed the area within the doctrine as the ground on which fellowship with Him is established and held. Sometimes we must recognise that line and have no association with those who are not careful enough in what they teach and practice to stay within the boundary lines of the "doctrine of Christ."
<dr class='alt5'>Jesus answered and said to them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” Then the Jews said, “It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will You raise it up in three days?” But He was speaking of the temple of His body. Therefore, when He had risen from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this to them; and they believed the Scripture and the word which Jesus had said." - John 2:19-22.</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3> 
He has accomplished our salvation. 
</h3>
<p>
All the benefits of our salvation are communicated to us through union with Christ. Outside of this union there is no salvation. Paul’s favourite phrase to describe salvation is in Christ. Salvation is a person, the Lord Jesus Christ. And an individual is saved when he comes into a right relation with Christ as a person. If a man is in Christ he will experience salvation: justification, sanctification, adoption, regeneration, reconciliation, redemption, forgiveness, conversion and glorification
<dr class='alt5'>"He was delivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification."  (Romans 4, 25)<dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3> 
All believers shall rise again to eternal life. 
</h3>
<p>
To be a Christian is not to be the most pitiable person in all the earth. Because of Christ's resurrection and His guarantee that He will resurrect all who believe in Him we are the most fortunate, the most blest people on the planet! Our faith is effective, we are not in our sins, our departed loved ones are with the Lord, and the labour we do for Him is not in vain. 
<dr class='alt5'>"Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live. And whoever lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?”  (John 11:25-26).</dr class='alt5'>
