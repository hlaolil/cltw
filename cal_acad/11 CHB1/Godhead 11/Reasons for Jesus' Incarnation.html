 	<h1>Reasons for Jesus' Incarnation</h1>
<p class='crb'>
Every true believer knows that the Babe Who was born of the Virgin Mary in Bethlehem of Judea over 2000 years ago was the Eternal God become flesh. There can be no question about this among us who have been redeemed from our sins by His precious blood. Assuredly, it is a mystery which we can only faintly comprehend with our finite minds, but faith knows that God became Man.</p>
<p>
Why did the Son of God become the Son of Man? Why the Incarnation? All who know Him will immediately answer: "He became man in order to die on the Cross for our sins." This is blessedly true. But there are also other reasons given in the Word of God as to why it was necessary for Christ to take a human body, why it was necessary for the Son of God to become the Son of Man. Let us observe from the Word the various reasons for the Incarnation of the Son of God.</p>
<h3>Christ became Man in order to die for our redemption.</h3>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>"This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners ..." (I Tim 1: 15).</dr class='alt5'>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>"just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many." (Matt 20:28).</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>Christ became Man to break sin's power over the believer.</h3>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>"For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh, God did by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, on account of sin: He condemned sin in the flesh, that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit." (Rom. 8:2-4).</dr class='alt5'>
<p> 
<dr class='alt5'>"I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me." (Gal. 2:20).</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>Christ became Man in order to defeat Satan.</h3>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>"For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil." (I John 3:8).</dr class='alt5'>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>"Inasmuch then as the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil,and release those who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage." (Heb. 2:14, 15).</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>Christ became Man in order to manifest God to man.</h3>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>"No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him." (John 1:18).</dr class='alt5'> 
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>"Jesus said to him, “Have I been with you so long, and yet you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; so how can you say, Show us the Father?" (John 14:9).</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>Christ became Man to be the believer's example.</h3>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>"He who says he abides in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked." <br>(I John 2:6).</dr class='alt5'> 

<p>
<dr class='alt5'>"if you take it patiently, this is commendable before God. For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps:" (I Pet. 2:20,21).</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>Christ became Man in order to become our High Priest.</h3>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>"For indeed He does not give aid to angels, but He does give aid to the seed of Abraham. Therefore, in all things He had to be made like His brethren, that He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people. For in that He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able to aid those who are tempted." (Heb. 2: 16-18).</dr class='alt5'>

</p>
<h3>Christ became Man to be Israel's King.</h3>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>"Then the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favour with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and shall call His name Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David. And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.”" (Luke 1:30-33). </dr class='alt5'>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>"Behold, the days are coming,” says the Lord, “That I will raise to David a Branch of righteousness; A King shall reign and prosper, And execute judgement and righteousness in the earth. In His days Judah will be saved, And Israel will dwell safely; Now this is His name by which He will be called: THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS" (Jer. 23:5,6).</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>
To prepare us for Christ's Second Coming 
</h3>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>All these glorious purposes of the Incarnation will be consummated at the Second Coming of Christ. Then will our redemption be completed, when our bodies are redeemed (Rom. 8:23; Eph. 4:30). </dr class='alt5'>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>Sin will then have no more power at all over us, for we shall be like Him <br>(I John 3:2).</dr class='alt5'>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>And though Satan was defeated at the Cross, God still permits him to reign over this world as an usurper. But his power will be completely broken at the return of the Lord Jesus (Rev. 20:1-3). </dr class='alt5'>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>At His return, our Lord shall manifest God as the God of Judgement, even as He manifested Him as the God of love at His First Coming (Isa. 30:18; Psa. 96:13). </dr class='alt5'>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>Christ is now the believer's example, but we so often fall short of following Him. Then we shall be able to follow Him perfectly, for we shall be like Him <br>(I John 3:2).</dr class='alt5'>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>Then too, His Priesthood will be fully consummated, for He reigns, it shall be as a Priest upon His throne (Zech 6:12, 13).</dr class='alt5'> 
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>then He will sit on the throne of His glory. (Matt. 25:31).</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
Wonderful coming day. Joy to the world! The Lord is coming back again. <dr class='alt5'><br>"Even so, come Lord Jesus" (Rev. 22:20).</dr class='alt5'><br>
HE HAS COME! HE IS COMING!</p>
<p><p class='block'><dr class='alt1'>
Do you know this wonderful Son of God Who became the Son of Man in order to redeem sinners?</dr class='alt1'> <dr class='alt5'><br>"But as many as received Him, to them He gave the right to become children of God, to those who believe in His name:" (John 1:12).</dr class='alt5'></p>
