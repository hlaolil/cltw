<h1>The Offspring of God
</h1>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>Therefore, since we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Divine Nature is like gold or silver or stone, something shaped by art and man’s devising. (Acts 17:29)<dr class='alt5'>  
<p>
If we are the offspring of God, He cannot be like those images of gold, silver, and stone, which are formed by the art and device of man; for the parent must resemble His offspring. Seeing, therefore, that we are living and intelligent beings, He from whom we have derived that being must be living and intelligent. It is necessary, also, that the object of religious worship should be much more excellent than the worshipper; but a man is, by innumerable degrees, more excellent than an image made out of gold, silver, or stone; and yet it would be impious to worship a man: how much more so to worship these images as gods! </p>
<p>
<strong>We ought not to think</strong> - It is absurd to suppose. The argument of the apostle is this: "Since we are formed by God; since we are like him, living and intelligent beings; since we are more excellent in our nature than the most precious and ingenious works of art, it is absurd to suppose that the original source of our existence can be like gold, and silver, and stone. Man himself is far more excellent than an image of wood and stone; how much more excellent still must be the great Fountain and Source of all our wisdom and intelligence." See this thought pursued at length in Isaiah 40:18-23.</p>
<p class="block">
Paul's argument was that since man is the offspring of God, it is inexcusable to liken God to an idol of gold or wood or stone. The parent would resemble the offspring.</p>
<p>
<strong>The Godhead</strong> - The divinity, the divine nature, or essence. The word used here is an adjective employed as a noun, and does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament.</p>
<p>
<strong>Is like unto gold</strong> ... - All these things were used in making images or statues of the gods. It is absurd to think that the source of all life and intelligence resembles a lifeless block of wood or stone. Even degraded pagan, one would think, might see the force of an argument like this.
