 	<h1>The Trinity and <br> Progressive Revelation</h1>
<p>
The Old Testament proclaimed the Father openly, and the Son more obscurely; the New Testament manifested the Son, and suggested the deity of the Spirit; now the Spirit Himself dwells among us, and supplies us with a clearer demonstration of Himself.</p> 
<p>
God has revealed Himself progressively, beginning with His oneness clearly and His threeness more subtly.First, the New Testament itself gives ample revelation for discerning the Spirit as the third member of the Trinity (cf. Matt. 28:19-20; Acts 5:3-4; and all references that designate the “Spirit of God” or the “spirit of Christ”).  We are not left seeking later revelation, the Scripture’s is sufficient.  Even if the early church required many years and disagreements to approximate this doctrinal formulation, Pneumatology is derived from the Bible and not later experience.</p> 
<p>
The Bible also teaches us that the Spirit does not “demonstrate Himself”.  Rather, the Spirit testifies of Christ and reveals to us the Father and the Son (cf. John 15:26; 16:13); amazingly, He does not glorify himself through self-revelation.  Thus, it is not appropriate to say that the Spirit has been showing Himself off during the church age.  His operations in the church age are to exalt Christ, who in turn glorifies the Father.</p>
<p>
[God] having been seen in bygone days through the Spirit prophetically, and then seen through the Son adoptively, shall be seen in the kingdom paternally, the Spirit preparing man for the Son of God, the Son leading to the Father, and the Father giving Him the incorruptibility and eternal life that come from the vision of God.</p>
<h3>
Knowing God...
</h3>
<p>
To know God prophetically, adoptively, and paternally… now that's something!! Consider the wisdom and benevolence of God to send the Spirit to inspire men to prophesy and prepare us for the Son, then the Son to come and manifest Himself in the flesh in order to make provision for redemption and access to the Father, so that in the age to come we might enter into the presence of the Father, through the Son, in the power and purity of the Spirit.  (By the way this should not deny the complementary truth that the Father and Son also prepared the way for the Son; just as the Spirit, sent from Father and Son, prepares us to encounter God at the Day of Judgement).</p>
<p>
Jonah 2:9 says, <dr class='alt5'>“salvation belongs to our God,”</dr class='alt5'> and considering the biblical storyline shows us without a doubt, that our salvation is a Trinitarian work.  He has coordinated His redemptive acts and faith-producing revelation in such a way that when we come to understand salvation truly we  realise that we encounter the Triune God (cf. Eph. 1:1-4; Rom. 8:28ff).  The Father architects.  The Son accomplishes.  The Holy Spirit applies.  There is no other salvation; there is no God: true salvation is Trinitarian and the true God in perfect unison to save.</p>
<dr class='alt'><center>What an amazing God!  What an amazing salvation!</center></p>
