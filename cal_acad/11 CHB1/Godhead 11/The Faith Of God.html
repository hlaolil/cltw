   <h1>The Faith Of God</h1>
<h3>
About Faith
</h3>
 <p>
<dr class='alt5'>"Without faith it's impossible to please God" (Heb. 11:6),</dr class='alt5'> so our relationship with the Lord is dependent on it.<br> Faith is what brings the things God has provided for us from the spiritual realm into the physical realm <dr class='alt5'>"faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen" (Heb. 11:1).</dr class='alt5'><br> <dr class='alt5'>"And this is the victory that has overcome the world—our faith". (1 John 5:4).</dr class='alt5'> Everything the Lord does for us is accessed through faith.</p>
<p>
Yet there is much confusion about faith today just as there has always been. It's like having a computer and knowing its potential but not having a clue how to use it. Many of us know how frustrating that is. The Bible is our manual with detailed instructions, but just like in the natural, few people take the time to really study it. They are impatient and want to do it on their own. They may reach some level of success, but to really be proficient, they have to read the book.
</p>
<p>
One of the areas about faith that gives people the most trouble is the concept that we have to acquire more faith and that some people have much faith, while others have virtually none. We spend a lot of effort, like a dog chasing its tail, trying to get something we already have. Every born-again Christian already has the same quality and quantity of faith that Jesus has. That's awesome!
</p>
<p>
In Ephesians, Paul says, <dr class='alt5'>"For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God," (Eph 2:8)</dr class='alt5'> <br>It's God's grace that saves us, but not His grace alone. If that were so, then everyone would be saved<dr class='alt5'> "For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men," (Tit. 2:11).</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
We have to put faith in God's grace, but the faith that we use isn't our own human faith. This verse says that faith is the gift of God.
</p>
<p>
There is a human faith that is inherent within every human being, and there is a supernatural faith of God that only comes to those who receive the good news.
</p>
<p>
Human faith can only believe what it can see, taste, hear, smell, or feel; it's limited to the five senses. Using natural human faith, we can sit in a chair we've never sat in and believe it will hold us up. We fly in aeroplanes when we don't fully understand how they work, and we don't know the pilot, but we trust that everything will be okay. That takes human faith, which God gave to every person.
</p>
<p>
What if I asked you to sit in a chair you couldn't see? Or what if the chair was missing one of its legs and was falling over? You wouldn't sit in a chair like that with human faith. Would you fly in a plane if you could see that the engine was falling off or the tires were flat? Your senses would forbid it.
</p>
<p>
Yet when it comes to God, we have to believe things that we cannot see. You haven't seen God or the devil. You haven't seen heaven or hell. You haven't seen sin; therefore, you wouldn't know what you would look like if your sins were taken away. However, you have to believe in all these things to be born again. How can you believe in things you can't see? The answer is that you can't believe in invisible things with human faith. You need God's supernatural faith.
</p>
<p>
In Romans Paul says, <dr class='alt5'>"God, who gives life to the dead and calls those things which do not exist as though they did;" (Rom 4:17)</dr class='alt5'> <br>God's faith goes beyond sight. God's faith operates supernaturally, beyond the limitations of our natural faith.
</p>
<p>
The context of this verse from Romans speaks about how God supernaturally blessed Abram and Sarai with a child in their old age. Abram was 100 and Sarai was 91 when Isaac was born. The year before Isaac's birth, when Abram still did not have a child by his wife, God told them the child was coming, and He changed Abram's name to Abraham and Sarai's name to Sarah. Abram meant "high father," but Abraham means, "to be populous, father of a multitude." God changed Abram's name and called him the father of a multitude before it came to pass.<br> Rom 4 explains this action by saying that <dr class='alt5'>"God ... calls those things which do not exist as though they did;" (Rom 4:17)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
When the Lord created the universe, He said<dr class='alt5'> “Let there be light”; and there was light (Gen 1:3).</dr class='alt5'> He created light on the first day but didn't create the sun, moon, and stars until the fourth day of creation (see Gen. 1:14-19).<br> The Lord called light into being first and four days later created a source for the light to come from. That's not the way natural man does things. We are limited, but God calls things that are not as though they were. That's supernatural.
</p>
<p>
That's the kind of faith we have to use to receive salvation. We have to believe in God, whom we have not seen, and believe that our sins are forgiven, which we cannot prove by natural means. It takes God's supernatural faith to receive salvation. Where do we get it from? We get it from God's Word.
</p>
<h3>
Hearing God's Word
</h3>
<p>
In Romans Paul says, <dr class='alt5'>"So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God." (Rom 10:17)</dr class='alt5'> We access God's faith through His Word.
</p>
<p>
When we hear God's Word, the Holy Spirit empowers it, and if we receive the truth, God's supernatural faith enters us. We were so destitute that we couldn't even believe the good news on our own. God had to make His kind of faith available to us so that we could believe in Him and receive His salvation. We were saved by using God's supernatural faith to receive His grace.
</p>
<p>
Once we receive God's supernatural faith at salvation, it doesn't leave us. <br>In Galatians Paul says, <dr class='alt5'>" But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control. Against such there is no law." (Gal 5:22-23).</dr class='alt5'><br> Faith becomes a permanent part of our born-again spirits. We sometimes use the God kind of faith that's present in our spirits and other times we don't.The truth is, it is always present. There is no lack of faith within any true Christian. There is just a lack of knowing and using what God has already given us.
</p>
<h3>
Everyone's measure of Faith
</h3>
<p>
In Romans Paul says, <dr class='alt5'>"as God has dealt to each one a measure of faith." <br>(Rom 12:3) </dr class='alt5'>.<br> God didn't give us different measures of faith; we all received THE measure of faith. If I were serving soup to a lot of people, and if I used the same ladle to dish it out, then that ladle would be THE measure. Everyone would get the same amount of soup because I would use the same measure. That's the way it is with God's faith. He only used one measure. All born-again Christians received the same amount of faith.
</p>
<p>
That's what the Apostle Peter said; <dr class='alt5'>" Simon Peter, a bond servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who have obtained like precious faith with us by the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ:" (2 Peter 1:1.)</dr class='alt5'><br> The Greek word that was translated "like precious" in this verse is "isotimos," which means "of equal value or honour." We have the same faith that Peter used when he raised Dorcas from the dead (Acts 9:36-42) and when he made people whole by touching them with just his shadow (Acts 5:15).
</p>
<p>
We also have the same faith that Paul had. Paul said in Galatians, <dr class='alt5'>"I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me." (Gal 2:20) </dr class='alt5'><br> Paul did not say that he lived by faith IN the Son of God but by the faith OF the Son of God. The measure of faith that Paul had was the same measure that Jesus had. It was Jesus' faith. If there is only one measure of faith (Rom. 12:3), then we also have the faith of Jesus.
</p>
<p>
We have the same quantity and quality of faith that Jesus has; therefore, we can do the same works that Jesus did, if we receive this truth and begin to use what we have <dr class='alt5'> “Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; (John 14:12).</dr class='alt5'><br> Because many Christians have not understood this, they have spent their time asking for faith or for more faith. How is God going to answer a prayer like that?
</p>
<p>
If I gave you my Bible and then you turned around and asked me for my Bible, what could I do? I would probably stand there in silence while I tried to figure out what was wrong with you. That's the reason there isn't an answer when we beseech the Lord for more faith. We already have the same faith Jesus has.
</p>
<h3>
Manifesting Faith
</h3>
<p>
Our Lord did say that He had never seen such great faith as the centurion manifested (Matt. 8:10), and He also spoke of His disciple's little faith (Matt. 8:26), but He was speaking about how much faith He saw. None of us use all the faith we've been given.
</p>
<p>
In that sense, some do have more faith than others, but technically, it is more faith that is being exhibited or that is functional. We all have been given THE measure of faith.
</p>
<p>
This is a major truth that will totally change your attitude and the results that your faith produces. Most people don't doubt that faith works. They just doubt that they have enough faith to get the job done. If Satan can blind you to this truth, then he can keep you from using the faith you have. Understanding this truth will radically change things.</p>
<p>
In Philemon Paul writes, <dr class='alt5'>" that the sharing of your faith may become effective by the acknowledgement of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus." (Philemon 1:6). </dr class='alt5'><br> Notice that Paul isn't praying that Philemon will get something more from the Lord. He was praying that his faith would begin to work as he acknowledged what he already had. The word "acknowledge" means, "to admit, recognise, or report the receipt of." You can only acknowledge something that you already have. We already have the faith of God, and it will begin to work when we acknowledge this.</p>
<p>
The more you know about faith and how it works, the better it will work for you. If all you knew was that you have the same faith Jesus has, then that would remove hopelessness and motivate you. People would eventually see results if they just kept trying, but they give up easily because they believe they don't have what it takes. That is not true. The Lord has given us everything we need, including all the faith we need. We just need to acknowledge what we have and begin to learn the laws that govern the operation of God's faith.</p>
