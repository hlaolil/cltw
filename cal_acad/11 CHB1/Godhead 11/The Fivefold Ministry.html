 <h1>
The Fivefold Ministry
</h1>
<p>
The term “fivefold ministry” comes from 

Ephesians 4:11-12: “And He Himself gave 

some to be apostles, some prophets, 

some evangelists, and some pastors and 

teachers, for the equipping of the saints 

for the work of ministry, for the edifying of 

the body of Christ.”
Jesus has given various ministry gifts to 

the church: apostles, prophets, 

evangelists, pastors, and teachers.  If the 

church is to be healthy it needs the 

influence of all five of these gifts.  

Unfortunately, it is very rare to see this 

happening today.  We need a resurrection 

of team ministry and a healthy balance of 

ministry gifts.
Below is a brief description of my 

understanding of the fivefold ministry gifts. 

Keep in mind that these gifts refer to a 

person.  With the nine manifestation gifts 

in 1 Corinthians 12 a person may have a 

gift or operate in a gift; with the fivefold 

ministry gifts the person is the gift.
</p>
<h2>
Apostle
</h2>
<p>
The apostle, more than the others, is 

focused on the kingdom of God 

advancing in the earth.  An apostle is “one 

who is sent” in order to extend the 

borders of God’s kingdom and establish it 

in a region or sphere.  Apostles operate in 

great spiritual authority, move in signs 

and wonders, establish church order, 

build according to the pattern of heaven, 

impart spiritual gifts, father others into 

ministry, and bring the church into 

maturity. An apostle will probably have 

first been one of the other ministry gifts, 

and will be able to flow in various roles.
</p>
<h2>
Prophet
</h2>
<p>
The prophet, more than the others, is 

focused on the immediate voice of God 

(or the rhema word). Prophets have great 

ability to receive the heart and mind of 

God and declare it to people, churches, 

cities, and nations.  Prophets receive 

revelation from the Lord in various ways 

but I would say that the most common is 

through hearing and seeing.  They equip 

the church to hear the voice of God for 

themselves, and to move in the 

supernatural gifts of the Spirit.
</p>
<h2>
Evangelist
</h2>
<p>
The evangelist, more than the others, is 

focused on the lost.  Evangelists burn 

with a passion to see the lost come to the 

saving knowledge of Jesus and make this 

the primary aim of their ministry.  They 

are gifted in reaching the lost in various 

ways, whether by preaching or personal 

connection. They also equip the church to 

evangelise.
</p>
<h2>
Pastor
</h2>
<p>
The pastor, more than the others, is 

focused on the flock.  The pastor builds 

long term relationships with a group of 

believers and provides oversight, spiritual 

nourishment, care, healing, and 

correction when needed. Pastors are true 

shepherds – they love the people of God 

and want to see them healthy and whole, 

and living in the destiny that God has for 

them.  I have observed that many people 

who carry the title “pastor” are not really 

pastors, but one of the other ministry 

gifts.  If this is the case, the congregation 

will not flourish unless someone else in 

leadership is fulfilling the pastoral role.
</p>
<h2>
Teacher
</h2>
<p>
The teacher, more than the others, is 

focused on the written Word of God (or 

the logos).  Teachers have a great love 

for the Scriptures and are concerned that 

the people of God become grounded in 

the Word.  They have the ability to 

communicate the Word in ways that 

people understand and they cause others 

to hunger for the Word. The teacher and 

the prophet bring a great balance to each 

other, as we need to be both grounded in 

the Bible and open to the voice of the Holy 

Spirit.

<h3>
The Properly functioning Fivefold ministry
</h3>
<p>
Here are some results of a fivefold ministries' gifts functioning properly in the church:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
by equipping of the saints for the work of ministry, 
</li>
<li>
for the edifying of the body of Christ, till we all come to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ; 
</li>
<li>
that we should no longer be children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every 
wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting, 
</li>
<li>
but, speaking the truth in love, may grow up in all things into Him who is the head—Christ — from whom the whole body, joined and knit together by what every joint supplies, according to the effective working by which every part does its share, causes growth of the body for the edifying of itself in love” (Ephesians 4:12-16). 
</li>
</ul>

<p class='crb'>
Let’s ask the Lord for a true restoration of all five of the ministry gifts and for team 
ministry to once again be the norm in the church. The result will be glorious!
