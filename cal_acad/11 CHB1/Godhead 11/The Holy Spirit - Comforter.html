   <h1>
The Holy Spirit - Comforter
</h1>
<p>
As Believers, we have to know about the 

important ministry of the Holy Spirit in our 

lives.  He is our Divine Partner and in this 

teaching we will look at a few aspects of 

His ministry in us.
</p>
<p class='block'> Jesus said in John 14, <dr class='alt5'>“And I will pray 

the Father, and He will give you another 

Helper (Comforter, Counsellor, Intercessor, Advocate, 

Strengthener, and Standby) that He may 

abide with you forever—” <br>(John 14:16)
</dr class='alt5'> <br>This is an 

amazing statement by Jesus about the 

ministry of the Holy Spirit.
</p>
<p>
First, Jesus established the importance of 

the Holy Spirit by naming Him “another” 

Helper. Jesus was the primary Helper

(Comforter) of the disciples up to that point. 

He was their “all in all”, but He said that 

even though He was going to His Father, 

He would not leave them alone. In some 

sense Jesus was going to ask the Father 

to send a “replacement” Helper to be 

with them forever. Think about it, who can 

really be a fitting replacement for Jesus? 

There is only One! The Holy Spirit! Jesus 

was saying that the Holy Spirit who would 

come after Him would be worthy to step 

into their lives to represent Him. The Holy 

Spirit has the same credentials, 

experience, attitude, love and power as 

Jesus! He is not beneath Jesus in Divine 

stature. Everything Jesus can do, the 

Holy Spirit can do too! That was what 

Jesus was saying!
</p>
<h2>
Holy Spirit Interceder
</h2>
<p>
Helper or Comforter in this context means 

“summoned or called to one’s side or aid” 

and was used to describe two powerful 

functions:
<p>

For one who pleads your case before a 

judge. The Holy Spirit is your Divine 

Attorney. He is your legal counsel in the 

spiritual realm. The Bible describes the 

enemy of our souls as “the accuser of the 

brethren”. He would come before the Lord 

to bring accusations against the elect of 

God. What an amazing thought that in 

such cases we are not destitute and 

without representation. The Holy Spirit 

pleads our case on our behalf! In addition 

to that, Jesus, Who is at the right hand of 

the Father already, joins the Holy Spirit 

and also pleads on our behalf because of 

the price He paid on the Cross for our 

sins.<p/>
<p>Think of it this way: <dr class='alt1'>The Holy Spirit is 

on retainer to represent you before God.</dr class='alt1'> 


</p>
<p>
It is also used for someone who pleads 

another’s cause. The Holy Spirit is a 

Divine Intercessor. We already know that 

Jesus intercedes on behalf of the saints 

in heaven, but now Jesus also describes 

the Holy Spirit as an Intercessor. We read 

in Romans 8: <dr class='alt5'>“Likewise the Spirit also 

helps in our weaknesses. For we do not 

know what we should pray for as we 

ought, but the Spirit Himself makes 

intercession for us with groanings which 

cannot be uttered.” The Holy Spirit 

“comes to our aid” (Romans 8:26)</dr class='alt5'> which means “to lay 

hold along with, to strive to obtain with 

others, to take hold with another”.
</p> 
<h2>
The Holy Spirit’s ministry
</h2>
<p>
The Holy Spirit’s ministry in your life is to 

help you wrap your hands around what 

the Lord wants you to have. The Holy 

Spirit will help you take hold of the 

blessings and power of God! He helps 

you with things you are unable to carry or 

take hold of yourself. <br> Next He <dr class='alt5'>“helps in our weaknesses”.</dr class='alt5'> This phrase covers both 

physical and emotional sickness and 

weakness and literally means “lack of 

strength or understanding”. Remember 

that the Holy Spirit resides in you. That 

means you have a Divine Diagnostician 

and Healer in you. When you are sick, 

you pray for healing. You might mention a 

list of symptoms or names of sicknesses 

in your prayer, but the Holy Spirit has 

access to your body up to the atomic 

level! He can intercede for you on a level 

you would never be able to. He can say: 

“Cell number 2,537,567 in the right side of 

his chest needs healing because. . .”<br> The 

Holy Spirit’s intercession brings a divine 

perspective to your life. When you have a 

lack of strength to understand, He comes 

to your aid. Or when you lack strength to 

do great things, He steps in and partners 

with you. When you are too weak to 

restrain from corrupt desires, the Holy 

Spirit provides aid to see you through to 

victory.  
</p>
<h2>
Holy Spirit Intercession
</h2>
<p>
This verse mentions a specific type of 

intercession. The Holy Spirit pleads on 

our behalf with unutterable groaning and 

yearnings. Within the context of Romans 

8 the meaning becomes obvious.<br> Paul 

writes in Romans 8 that <dr class='alt5'>“For we know 

that the whole creation groans and 

labours with birth pangs together until 

now.” (Romans 8:22).</dr class='alt5'>  He is speaking of contractions in 

labour and how the whole earth was in 

labour for the life which is to come.<br> The 

Holy Spirit intercedes through travail on 

our behalf. He is in a “birthing process” 

when He prays for us. How can this be? 

Well, He labours on our behalf for new 

life. He is ready to birth the answers to 

your questions, the healing for your 

sickness, the provision for your lack, the 

power for your lack of strength, etc. Isn’t 

this wonderful! Not only does the Holy 

Spirit identify and diagnose what you 

need, but He also meets your every need 

by “birthing it” into your spirit. He is the 

initiator of new life in you. He says things 

you cannot find word for.</p>
