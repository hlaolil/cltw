 <h1>
The Ascension of Jesus Christ
</h1>
<p>
After Jesus rose from the dead, He <dr class='alt5'>"presented Himself alive"</dr class='alt5'> (Acts 1:3) to the women near the tomb (Matthew 28:9-10), to His disciples (Luke 24:36-43), and to more than 500 others (1 Corinthians 15:6). In the days following His resurrection, Jesus taught His disciples about the Kingdom of God (Acts 1:3).
</p>
<p>
Forty days after the resurrection, Jesus and His disciples went to Mount Olivet, near Jerusalem. There, Jesus promised His followers that they would soon receive the Holy Spirit, and He instructed them to remain in Jerusalem until the Spirit had come. Then Jesus blessed them, and as He gave the blessing, He began to ascend into heaven. The account of Jesus' ascension is found in Luke 24:50-51 and Acts 1:9-11.
</p>
<p>
It is plain from Scripture that Jesus' ascension was a literal, bodily return to heaven. He rose from the ground gradually and visibly, observed by many intent onlookers. As the disciples strained to catch a last glimpse of Jesus, a cloud hid Him from their view, and two angels appeared and promised Christ's return. </p>

<p> 
<dr class='alt5'>"This same Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will so come in like manner as you saw Him go into heaven." (Acts 1:11).</dr class='alt5'
</p>
<h3>
Why the Ascension of Jesus Christ is meaningful 
</h3>
<p>
This was the end of His earthly ministry. God the Father had lovingly sent His Son into the world at Bethlehem, and now the Son was returning to the Father. The period of human limitation was at an end.
<br>
It signified success in His earthly work. All that He had come to do, He had accomplished.
</p>
<p>
This marked His return to heavenly glory. Jesus' glory had been veiled during His sojourn on earth, with one brief exception at the Transfiguration <br>(Matt 17:1-9).
</p>
<p>
It symbolised His exaltation by the Father (Eph 1:20-23). The One with whom the Father is well pleased (Matt 17:5) was received up in honour and given a name above all names (Phil 2:9).
</p>
<p>
He went to prepare a place for us (John 14:2).
</p>
<p>
He went to begin His new work as High Priest (Heb 4:14-16) and Mediator of the New Covenant (Heb 9:15).
</p>
<p>
This set the pattern for His return. When Jesus comes to set up the Kingdom, He will return just as He left-literally, bodily, and visibly in the clouds (Acts 1:11; Dan 7:13-14; Matt 24:30; Rev 1:7).
</p>
<p class='block'>
Currently, the Lord Jesus is in heaven. The Scriptures frequently picture Him at the right hand of the Father-a position of honour and authority (Psa 110:1; Eph 1:20; Heb 8:1). Christ is the Head of the Church (Col 1:18), the giver of spiritual gifts (Eph 4:7-8), and the One who fills all in all (Eph 4:9-10).</p>
