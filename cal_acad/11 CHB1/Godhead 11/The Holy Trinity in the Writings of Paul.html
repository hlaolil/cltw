   <h1>The Holy Trinity <br>in the Writings of Paul</h1>
<p>
Apart from the teachings of Christ reported especially in the gospels of Matthew and John, a number of apostolic writings in the New Testament indicate that the first-century Church clearly understood and professed Christ’s teachings about the Trinity. Among these, the writings of Paul to various faith communities during his missionary travels stand out because they were written before the gospels and they include many profound insights into Christ’s teachings related to the persons of the Trinity.
</p>
<h3>
Trinitarian communion
</h3>
<p>
In his letter to the Romans, Paul wrote, <dr class='alt5'>“Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom also we have access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and rejoice in hope of the glory of God ... because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us.”(Rom 5:1-2,5)</dr class='alt5'> See how Paul describes in this passage the everlasting circle of Trinitarian communion, in which the Father’s peace and love come to us through our Lord Jesus Christ, poured into us through the Holy Spirit whom He has given to us.
</p>
<h3>
The Holy Spirit-Romans
</h3>
<p>
In Romans 8 Paul explains the doctrine of the indwelling of the Spirit of God: <br><dr class='alt5'>“But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Now if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His. And if Christ is in you, the body is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is life because of righteousness. But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you.<br> For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father.” The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, and if children, then heirs—heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer with Him, that we may also be glorified together. (Rom 8:9-11, 14-17).</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>
Baptism
</h3>
<p>
At baptism, Paul is telling us, our new life in Christ makes us a new being, a new self, governed by the Holy Spirit under whose direction we are enabled to fulfil the Father’s will for us. This same Spirit who enlivens us for holiness will resurrect our bodies at Christ’s return on the last day. The Holy Spirit’s presence within us gives us not only a new life, but also a new relationship to God as adopted children and heirs of God through Christ’s actions on our behalf. So much so, that we are emboldened to call the Father “Abba!” [“daddy”, “papa”] with the same child-like familiarity as Jesus Himself did (see Mark 14:36). <br> In Romans 9 Paul wrote,<dr class='alt5'> “... from them [the Jews], according to the flesh, comes the Messiah, who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen,”(Rom 9:5)</dr class='alt5'> clearly stating his belief that Jesus the Christ is God.
</p>
<h3>
The Holy Spirit-Corinthians
</h3>
<p>
Paul’s first letter to the Corinthians speaks often about the Holy Spirit. Writing to address a number of excesses in that community, he admonished in 1 Cor 3 the guilty ones to abandon their sexual excesses by reiterating the doctrine of the indwelling of the Holy Spirit in the soul of the baptised Christian: <dr class='alt5'><br>“Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?If anyone defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which temple you are” (1 Cor 3:16-17)</dr class='alt5'><br> He repeats this again in 1 Cor 6<dr class='alt5'> “Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?” (1 Cor 6:19)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
Alluding to revelations of God’s wisdom, Paul wrote in 1 Cor 2, <dr class='alt5'>“But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God. For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.” The implication is clear: it is the Spirit of God, who is within God, who searches the very depths of God and reveals God’s wisdom, which is Jesus Christ, to us. (1 Cor 2:10-11)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
Paul reminds the Corinthians that they used to be dissolute,<dr class='alt5'> “And such were some of you. But you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the Spirit of our God” <br>(1 Cor 6:11).<dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>
Paul confirms the Trinity
</h3>
<p>
In 1 Cor 8 Paul confirms the Christian belief in the equality of God the Father and Jesus the Christ:<dr class='alt5'> “... yet for us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and through whom we live.” (1 Cor 8:6)</dr class='alt5'> </p>
<p>
In 1 Cor 12:3-11, Paul writes eloquently about the gifts and services given by the Holy Spirit to Christians in the sacrament of Confirmation. Though diverse and many, they always are given by the one Spirit.</p>
<p>
In 2 Cor 13 Paul gives this Trinitarian blessing to that Church: <dr class='alt5'><br>“The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.” (2 Cor 13:14)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>
Trinity in Ephesians 
</h3>
<p>
Paul relates the unity of the Body of Christ to the unity of the persons in the Trinity in Eph 4: <dr class='alt5'>“There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.” (Eph 4:4-6)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
So, before the appearance of the gospels, Paul already was instructing Gentile Christians in the Christian faith in the Holy Trinity, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, giving us, among other truths, that of the indwelling, through God’s grace, of God’s Holy Spirit and, therefore of God the Father and of Jesus Christ, God the Son. He was telling us the good news that, through baptism in Jesus Christ, the inner life of God — the eternally loving relationship of God the Father to God the Son, of God the Son to God the Father, and of God the Father and God the Son to God the Holy Spirit, and of God the Holy Spirit to both God the Father and God the Son — is at work deep within our souls.</p>
