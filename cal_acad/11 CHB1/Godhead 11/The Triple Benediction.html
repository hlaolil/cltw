 	<h1>The Triple Benediction</h1>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>"May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all." 2 Cor. 13:14</dr class='alt5'>
<p>
<h2>This benediction contains rich and incalculable blessings.</h2>
<h3>
God the Father
</h3>
<p>May The Love of God, that is, the Father, be yours. Yours not only in that general sense in which He loves the world—but in the special favour which He bears to His people—in all its rich, immense, infinite, and eternal benefits. Admire, as you well may, this love of God to His people—that He should not satisfy Himself with bestowing upon them little things, and temporal blessings— but should confer upon His people all spiritual and eternal blessings in heavenly things in Christ Jesus—that He should love them not only for a while—but forever and ever—that He should put forth for them the uttermost of His love. Oh, this is wonderful! Yes, He has gone to the uttermost in nothing but His love— He has never showed so much of His wisdom and power—but He could show more; He could go on creating and multiplying worlds to eternity—but His love cannot do more or greater things than it has done in giving us Christ, heaven, and Himself. He has left His love no greater work to do, no richer development to make. His love is inconceivable by all but Himself. It has heights not to be scaled, depths not to be fathomed, breadths not to be measured, and lengths not to be traced—it passes knowledge. Oh the greatness of God's love! Admire it, I say, and may you possess it, in itself, and in all its operations and provisions, in time, and through eternity.</p>
<p>
May the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be yours— that grace of which the apostle so beautifully writes, where he says, <br>
 <dr class="alt5">"You know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, though He was rich, yet for our sakes He became poor, that you through His poverty might be rich,"<br> 2 Cor. 8:9.</dr class="alt5"> </p> 
<p>That grace of which he speaks in another place by itself, as if it were of itself; the sum of all spiritual blessings,<p> 
<dr class='alt5'>"The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you," 1 Cor. 16:23.</dr class='alt5'> <br><br> Who can imagine what this grace is in its spring and fountain in the heart of Jesus, and in all its streams in the work of redemption; how unsearchable, how free, how abundant, even to exceeding riches? Who can imagine what that grace must be, of which the stable and manger of Bethlehem, the life of humiliation and sorrow, the endurance of ceaseless contradiction and persecution, the agony and bloody sweat in the garden, the degradation and insults in the hall of Pilate, and the tormenting and accursed death of the cross—were but the fruits, expressions, and operations? What must be the grace itself, when these are only its outward workings? May this grace be yours. May you live in the heart of Jesus. May His favour encompass you like a shield. May all the blessed, and untold, and inconceivable results of His mediation be your portion. And then you are rich amid the deepest poverty; safe amid the most pressing danger; happy in the heaviest sorrow; great and honourable amid the lowest obscurity.</p>

<p>May The Fellowship of the Holy Spirit be yours. By this we are to understand, the participation and fruition of His all-enlightening, renewing, sanctifying, preserving influences. May you live in the Spirit by regeneration, and walk in the Spirit by sanctification. May you be habitually led by Him. May He be your Counsellor and Comforter. May He dwell in you, as in His temple, and actuate you as the pervading soul of His body the church. May He help your infirmities, indite your prayers, and make intercession within you, according to the will of God. May He fill your minds with light, your consciences with peace, your hearts with love, your lives with holiness. May He so shine upon His work in your souls, and so enable you to compare it with the description of His work in the word, as to witness to you in this manner clearly and assuredly that you are the children of God. May He, by His heavenly light, and love, and purity, and peace which He shall impart, be to you, and in you, as the pledge of heavenly bliss, and at the same time mould and shape you as vessels which He is preparing for glory.</li></p></ol>

Thus is the whole Trinity concerned in the great work of your salvation. All originating in the love of the Father, executed by the grace of the Son, and applied by the power of the Spirit. Each Person performing His own part according to the arrangements in the eternal covenant of redemption, yet all concurring in the work of each.</p>
