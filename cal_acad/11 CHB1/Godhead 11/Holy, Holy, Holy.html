   <h1>Holy, Holy, Holy</h1>
<p>
Isaiah had a vision of the unsearchable glory of God. He saw the Lord seated on His throne, high and lifted up with His glory filling the temple. Around the Lord were massive angels, who, because of God’s great glory, covered their faces with their wings and cried out,<p>
<dr class='alt5'>Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of hosts; the whole earth is full of His glory.” – Isaiah 6:3</drclass='alt5'>
<p>
These angels do not sing these words as we often do … hands in pockets, eyes wandering around the sanctuary, yawning, thinking about how many times we’ve sung this song and wishing we could do a new song. No! These mighty, awesome angels are not merely singing a song. They are shouting to one another in response to what they see. They are continually overwhelmed, moment after moment, with the glory of God that they are realising. In fact, their shouts are so loud that the posts of the door shake! They are experiencing a perpetual revelation of God’s power and wisdom and greatness! They can do nothing but shout and worship!
</p>
<h3>
Do we really know Him
</h3>
<p>
Are we pursuing the knowledge of the greatness of His glory? Are we seeking to know Him for who He really is … who His Word says He is? Or do we know Him in the image of corruptible man? Have we created Him in our own image? Do we worship Him according to the teachings or commandments of men?</p>
<p>
His glory demands fear and reverence. No one can see God and live. No one can stand in His presence. We sing about worshipping face down on the ground, but have we done it? Do we enter the presence of God in our assemblies and hit the floor because our hearts say we must? Do we respect and honour Him the way our lips say we do?<p>
<dr class='alt5'>…these people draw near with their mouths and honour Me with their lips, but have removed their hearts far from Me… – Isaiah 29:13</dr class='alt5'> </p>
<p>
Do we only know Him as the Son of Man, as friend and Saviour, but not as the Most Holy, the Mighty God, the One who holds the stars in the span of His hand, the Glorious King of Heaven? The heavens declare the glory of God! And we catch a glimpse of His glory in His Word. We are invited to behold His greatness.<p>
<dr class='alt5'>For who in the heavens can be compared to the Lord? Who among the sons of the mighty can be likened to the Lord? God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and to be held in reverence by all those around Him. – Psalm 89:6-7<dr class='<drclass='alt5'> </p>
<p class='crb'>
As we write our worship songs, let’s write them in most holy reverence and fear. Let’s write them from experience. Let’s remember who we worship and why He is worthy to be worshipped. Let’s truly worship the Lord for who He really is.</p>
