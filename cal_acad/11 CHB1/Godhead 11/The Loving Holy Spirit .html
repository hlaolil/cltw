   <h1>
The Loving Holy Spirit 
</h1>
<p>
Many people today are scared of the Holy Spirit. They fear that they've done the unpardonable sin and are forever enemies of the this third person of the Godhead. This is a lie from the pits of hell, and the devil knows it! The Holy Spirit cares for us and loves us dearly. We are precious to Him, and there are many scriptures to give us an insight into the loving nature of the Holy Spirit.
</p>
<p>
The Holy Spirit spoke to me and prompted me to write this teaching about how much He loves us and about His loving nature towards us. I believe it will be a rich blessing to anybody who's struggled with fears of the unpardonable sin.
</p>
<h3>
The Holy Spirit wanted to make us in God's image
</h3>
<p>
Let's start at the beginning. When God made man in His image, they (the Father, Son and Holy Spirit) said, <dr class='alt5'>"Let Us make man in Our image!"</dr class='alt5'> The Holy Spirit (along with the Father and Son) wanted to make you and me in His image and give us dominion over all other creation here on earth! You'll find this passage in the first chapter of Genesis:
</p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'> "Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness; let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth. (Gen 1:26)"</dr class='alt5'>
</ul>
</li>
</p>
<h3>
It was the Holy Spirit who sent Jesus to heal and restore us!
</h3>
<p>
If you turn to Luke chapter 4, you'll find that it was the precious Holy Spirit who send Jesus forth to minister healing, deliverance and restoration to us. Let's look at this passage in the Bible:
</p>
<p><dr class='alt5'>
“The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, Because He has anointed Me To preach the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the broken hearted, To proclaim liberty to the captives And recovery of sight to the blind, To set at liberty those who are oppressed; To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord." <br>(Luke 4:18-19)</dr class='alt5'>
</ul>
</li>
</p>
<p>
Those wonderful things listed in the verse above were the desire of the Holy Spirit for us, and He sent us Jesus to minister that healing, freedom and restoration unto us.
It was the Holy Spirit who empowered Jesus to go about healing all who were oppressed of the devil, raise the dead, and heal the sick. It is that same Holy Spirit who empowers us today to go forth and do the same!
</p>
<p><dr class='alt5'>
"how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him." (Acts 10:38)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>
The Holy Spirit is our advocate and intercedes for us
</h3>
<p>
Jesus referred to the Holy Spirit as our Helper. Look at this passage in the Bible:
<dr class='alt5'>"But the Helper, the Holy Spirit,..." (John 14:26)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
The word Helper in this verse comes out of the Greek word parakletos which means, "An intercessor, consoler: - advocate, Helper." The Holy Spirit is not only our Helper, but also an intercessor, consoler and advocate. Let's take a brief look at each one of these properties:
</p>
<p>
An intercessor is somebody who intercedes on our behalf. Take a look at this passage in your Bible: <dr class='alt5'>"Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered. Now He who searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He makes intercession for the saints according to the will of God. And we know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are the called according to His purpose" (Rom 8:26-28)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
A consoler is somebody who is there to talk to and share your burden with. Merriam-Webster tells us that to console somebody means to help soothe their grief or to comfort them. The Holy Spirit is concerned about what is going on in our lives and wants to help us make it through the difficult times. He is there as a shoulder that we can cry upon and understands us.
</p>
<p>
An advocate is somebody who pleads our case before the Father. Just as Abraham pleaded with God not to destroy the city of Sodom, so also the Holy Spirit pleads on our behalf before the Father.
</p>
<p>
A Helper is somebody who understands our struggles and is here to comfort and help us. The Holy Spirit understands what you and I are going through, and is here to help us in our weaknesses and our times of need.
</p>
<p class='block'><dr class='alt3'>
The Holy Spirit is working on our behalf behind the scenes in the spirit realm!
</p>
<h3>
The Holy Spirit wants us to know what has been given to us
</h3>
<p>
The Holy Spirit wants to tell us all about the good things that God has given us. He wants to make known these things unto us, so that we can take advantage of them.
</p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>"But as it is written: “Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man
The things which God has prepared for those who love Him.”<br> But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God. For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God. Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might know the things that have been freely given to us by God." (1 Cor 2:9-12)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
The Holy Spirit wants to show us the things which have been given to us by Christ, so that we can reach out in faith and receive them. The Holy Spirit wants us to take advantage of what Christ has done for us and take hold of the many blessings (healing, deliverance, peace, joy, spiritual authority, etc.) that have been given to us!
</p>
<h3>
The Holy Spirit of adoption
</h3>
<p>
The Holy Spirit loved us long before we came to Christ, and desired to adopt us as children into the family of God. He testifies with our spirits, telling us that we are children of God. 
</p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>"For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father.” The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God," (Rom 8:15-16)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>
The Holy Spirit is a Spirit of compassion and love for the needy 
</h3>
<p>
Going back into the Old Testament, we find this passage: </p>
<p><dr class='alt5'>
"As for your nativity, on the day you were born your navel cord was not cut, nor were you washed in water to cleanse you; you were not rubbed with salt nor wrapped in swaddling cloths. No eye pitied you, to do any of these things for you, to have compassion on you; but you were thrown out into the open field, when you yourself were loathed on the day you were born. “And when I passed by you and saw you struggling in your own blood, I said to you in your blood, Live! Yes, I said to you in your blood, Live!" (Ezek 16:4-6)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>
The Holy Spirit wants to make known to us the things of God
</h3>
<p>
The Holy Spirit is here to teach us about the good things of God and lead us into all truth. 
</p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>"But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you." (John 14:26)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>"However, when He, the Spirit of truth, has come, He will guide you into all truth; for He will not speak on His own authority, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will tell you things to come. He will glorify Me, for He will take of what is Mine and declare it to you. All things that the Father has are Mine. Therefore I said that He will take of Mine and declare it to you." (John 16:13-15)<dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>
The Holy Spirit chose to make us His dwelling place
</h3>
<p>
The Holy Spirit has chosen to make our bodies His indwelling temple or habitation. Take a look at these passages in 1 Corinthians: 
</p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>"Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?" (1 Cor 6:19)</dr class='alt5'> </p>
<p><dr class='alt5'>"Or do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and you are not your own?" (1 Cor 3:16,)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>
The Holy Spirit wants to sanctify us
</h3>
<p>
The Holy Spirit is here to take us higher in our walk with God and bring us closer in our relationship with Him. He is here to help us become more Christ-like and be sanctified, that is made pure and holy in our walk with God. 
</p>
<p><dr class='alt5'>
"But we are bound to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved by the Lord, because God from the beginning chose you for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth, to which He called you by our gospel, for the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ." <br>(2 Thess 2:13-14)<dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>
Where the Spirit is, there is freedom!
</h3>
<p><dr class='alt5'>
"Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord." (2 Cor 3:17-18)</dr class='alt5'
</p>
<h3>
He has come to set us free from the law of sin and death.
</h3>
<p><dr class='alt5'>
"For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death." (Rom 8:2) </dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>
It is the Holy Spirit who calls us to eternal life 
</h3>
<p>
It is the Holy Spirit who leads us to Christ. It is the Holy Spirit who calls people into the kingdom of God! 
</p>
<p><dr class='alt5'>
"And the Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And let him who hears say, “Come!” And let him who thirsts come. Whoever desires, let him take the water of life freely." (Rev 22:17)<dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p class='block'><dr class='alt1'>
Holy Spirit is the one who woos us to the love of Jesus, and makes the love of Christ real to us... He gives us revelation, understanding and wisdom and teaches us as a personal tutor would.
