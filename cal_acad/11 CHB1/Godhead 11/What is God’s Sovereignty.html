   <h1>What is God’s Sovereignty</h1>
<p>
God's sovereignty is beyond human 
understanding.
Sovereignty means that God, as the 

ruler of the Universe, has the right 

to do whatever He wants. Further, He 

is in complete control over everything 

that happens.</p>
<p>
The sovereignty of God is supported by 

many verses in the Bible, among them:

<dr class='alt5'><br><br>Psalm 115:3 But 

our God is in heaven; He does whatever 

He pleases.</dr class='alt5'>
<dr class='alt5'><br><br>Daniel 4:35 All the inhabitants of 

the earth are reputed as nothing; He 

does according to His will in the army 

of heaven And among the inhabitants of 

the earth. No one can restrain His 

hand Or say to Him, “What have You 

done?”</dr class='alt5'>
<dr class='alt5'><br><br>Romans 9:20 But indeed, O 

man, who are you to reply against God? 

Will the thing formed say to Him who 

formed it, “Why have you made me like 

this?” </dr class='alt5'></p>
<p?
God's sovereignty is a stumbling block 

for atheists and unbelievers, who 

demand that if God is in total 

control, that He eliminate all evil 

and suffering from the world. The 

Christian's answer is that the human 

mind cannot grasp why God allows evil; 

instead, we are called to have faith 

in God's goodness and love.</p>
<p>
A theological puzzle is also raised by 

the sovereignty of God. If God truly 

controls everything, how can humans 

have free will? It is obvious from 

Scripture and from life that people do 

have free will. We are not robots. We 

make both good and bad choices. 

However, the Holy Spirit prompts the 

human heart to choose God, a good 

choice. In the examples of King David 

and the Apostle Paul, God also works 

with man's bad choices to turn lives 

around.</p>
<p>
The ugly truth is that sinful human 

beings deserve nothing from a holy 

God. We cannot manipulate God in 

prayer. We cannot expect a rich, 

pain-free life, as touted by the 

prosperity gospel. Neither can we 

expect to reach heaven because we are 

a "good person." Jesus Christ has been 

provided to us as the way to heaven. 

(John 14:6)</p>
<p>
Part of God's sovereignty is that 

despite our unworthiness, He chooses 

to love and save us anyway. He gives 

everyone the freedom to accept or 

reject His love.</p>
