<h1>
Hindering the Holy Spirit
</h1>
<p class="blockin"><dr class='alt1'>
"And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God,"--Eph. 4:30 <br>
"You always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, "--Acts7:51.<br>
"Do not quench the Spirit."-1 Thess.5:19.
</p class="blockin">
<p>
It is very touching and solemn that while 

the Holy Spirit might, in the exercise of 

His omnipotence, coerce our will, and 

compel us to submit to His authority, yet 

He approaches us with the most 

deferential regard for our feelings and 

independence, even suffering us to resist 

and disobey Him, and bearing long with 

our wilfulness and waywardness.
</p>
<p>
There are several terms used in the 

Scriptures to denote the manner in which 

we may sin against the Holy Spirit.
</p>
<h2>
We May Quench the Spirit.
</h2>
<p>
This has reference, perhaps, mainly to 

the hindrance we offer to His work in 

others, rather than to our resistance of 

His personal dealings with our own souls.
</p>
<p>
Among the various hindrances which we 

may offer to the Holy Spirit may be 

mentioned such as these:</p>
<ul>
<li>
We may refuse to obey His impulses in 

us when He bids us speak or act for Him. 

We may be conscious of a distinct 

impression of the Spirit of God bidding us 

to testify for Christ, and by disobedience, 

or timidity, or procrastination, we may 

quench His working, both in our own soul 

and in the heart of another</li>
<li>
We must suppress His voice in others, 

either by using our authority to restrain 

His messages, when He speaks through 

His servants or refusing to allow the 

liberty of testimony. Many hold the reins of 

ecclesiastical authority unduly, and thus 

lose the free and effectual working of the 

Holy Ghost in their churches and in their 

work.</li>
<li>
There is a less direct way, however, of 

politely silencing Him by forcing Him out, 

and so filling the atmosphere with the 

spirit of stiffness, criticism, and a certain 

air of respectability and rigidness that He 

gently withdraws from the uncongenial 

scene, and refuses to thrust His 

messages upon unwilling hearts.</li>
<li>
The Spirit may be grieved by the method 

of public worship in a congregation.
It may be either so stiff and formal that 

there is no room for His spontaneous 

working, or so full of worldly and 

unscriptural elements as to repel and 

offend Him from taking any part in a 

pompous ritual. An operatic choir and a 

ritualistic service will effectually quench all 

the fire of God's altar, and send the gentle 

dove to seek a simpler nest.</li>
<li>
The Spirit may be quenched by the 

preacher, and his spirit and method.
His own manner may be so intellectual 

and self-conscious, and his own spirit so 

thoroughly cold and vain that the Holy 

Ghost is neither recognised nor known in 

his work. His sermons may be on themes 

in which the Spirit has no interest, for He 

only witnesses to the Holy Scriptures and 

the person of Christ, and wearily turns 

away from the discussion of philosophy, 

and the stale show of critical brilliancy 

over the questions of the day or the 

speculations of man's own vain reason.
Perhaps his address is so rigidly written 

down that the Holy Spirit could not find a 

opportunity for even a suggestion, if He so 

desired, and His promptings and leading 

so coolly set aside by a course of 

elaborate preparation which leaves no 

room for God.</li>
<li>
The spirit of error in the teachings of the 

pulpit will always quench the Holy Spirit.
He is jealous for His own inspired Word 

and when vain man attempts to set it 

aside He looks on with indignation, and 

expose such teachers to humiliation and 

failure.
The spirit of self-assertion and self 

-consciousness is always fatal to the free 

working of the Holy Ghost.
When a man stands up in the sacred 

desk to air his eloquence and call 

attention to his intellectual brilliancy, or to 

preach himself in any sense, he will 

always be deserted by the Holy Spirit. He 

uses the things "that are not to bring to 

naught the things that are." And before we 

can expect to become the instruments of 

His power, we must wholly cease from 

self and be lost in the person and glory of 

Jesus.</li>
<li>
The spirit of pride, fashion and worldly 

display in the pews, is just as fatal as 

ambition in the pulpit.
Such an atmosphere seems to freeze out 

the spirit of devotion, and erect on the 

throne of the lowly Nazarene a goddess 

of carnal pride and pleasure, like the foul 

Venus that the Parisian mob set up in the 

Madeleine at Paris in the days of the 

revolution, as an object of worship. From 

such an atmosphere the Holy Ghost turns 

away grieved and disgusted.</li>
<li>
The quickening and reviving influences of 

the Holy Ghost are often quenched in the 

very hour of promise by wrong methods 

in the work of Christ's church.
How often, on the eve of a real revival, the 

minds of the people have been led away 

by some public entertainment in 

connection with the house of God, or its 

after-fruits withered by a series of unholy 

fairs and secular bids for money, and the 

introduction of the broker and the 

cattle-vendor into the cleansed temple of 

Jehovah, as in the days of Christ.</li>
<li>
The spirit of criticism and controversy is 

fatal to the working of the Holy Ghost.
The gentle dove will not remain in an 

atmosphere of strife. If we would cherish 

His power we must possess His love, 

and frown down all wrangling gossip, evil 

speaking, malice, envy, and public 

controversy in the preaching of the Word.
Sometimes a single word of criticism 

after an impressive service will dispel all 

its blessed influence upon the heart of 

some interested hearer, and counteract 

the gracious work that would have 

resulted in the salvation of the soul.
And so, public controversy is as fatal to 

the Spirit's working as personal criticism.
It is when the children of God unite at the 

feet of Jesus, and together seek His 

blessing, that He comes in all the fullness 

of His life-power.
</li>
<li>
The Spirit may be quenched in the hearts 

of our friends by unwise counsel, or 

ungodly influence.
The little child may be discouraged from 

seeking Christ by a worldly parent, or the 

ignorant assumption that it is too young to 

be a Christian, or too busy with its 

studies, or its social enjoyments, for such 

things.
The attractions of the world and claims 

and pressures of business, may be 

interposed in the way of some seeking 

heart, and we find in eternity that we put a 

stumbling-block in our friend's way, from 

which he fell into perdition.
Let us be very careful lest, in our 

wilfulness and pride, we not only miss 

ourselves the inner chambers of the 

kingdom of heaven, but hinder those that 

would enter from going in.
Oh! if we would cherish the faintest 

breath of life in the rescued waif that has 

been snatched from a watery grave, if we 

could fan the expiring flame of life in a 

friend's bosom, let us be careful lest we 

quench the spark of everlasting life in a 

human soul, and stand at the last, 

responsible for the murder of immortal 

beings, and crimson with the blood of 

souls. "Quench not the Spirit."</li></ul>
</p>
<h2>
We May Grieve the Spirit.
</h2>
<p>
This is a very tender expression; it 

suggests His gentleness and patience; 

grieved rather than angry with His 

unfaithful and distrustful children.</p>
<ul>
<li>
We may grieve Him by our doubts and 

distrust of His love and promises. Thus 

Moses grieved Him when he struck the 

rock instead of gently speaking.
Many are afraid of the Holy Ghost and 

think Him a despot and a terror; shrinking 

even from His too close approach, as 

though He would consume us by His 

holiness. He wants us to love Him, and 

come near to Him as the gentle mother; 

to believe in His promises, to count Him 

faithful, and to treat Him as one who does 

come to us and dwell within us.
</li>
<li>
We grieve the Holy Spirit when we refuse 

to wholly yield ourselves to Him, and hold 

back from entire abandonment and 

surrender, or when, having so 

surrendered ourselves, we shrink back 

from His actual leading and refuse to 

meet the tests He brings, and lie upon the 

wheel in stillness while He moulds the 

plaster in clay.
He is grieved at our wilfulness and 

rebellion and resistance. He knows we 

are losing a blessing, and that we must 

again go through the same discipline if we 

are to have our blessings from Him.
He sees in it the spirit of distrust and 

unbelief, and He feels wounded and 

slighted by our shrinking.
</li>
<li>
We grieve the Holy Spirit when we fail to 

enter into the fullness of His grace, and 

receive the Lord Jesus Christ as our 

complete Saviour.
He has not written one word that we can 

afford to allow to become of none effect. It 

is an insult to His wisdom and love to 

treat the higher visions of His grace as if 

they were not binding upon our life.
They should fully honour Him, press 

forward into all His will, and feel they owe 

to Him as well as themselves that they 

should lose nothing of all that He has 

wrought, nor seem to come short of 

entering into His rest.
Oh, how many of His children are grieving 

Him as a mother would be grieved, if after 

having, at great cost and toil, provided 

bountifully for her children, they should 

refuse her bounty or despise her rich 

provision!
</li>
<li>
We grieve the Holy Spirit when we fail to 

hearken to His voice.
He is constantly calling upon us to listen, 

and He never speaks in vain, nor can we 

ever afford to miss the slightest whisper. 

When, therefore, we fail to hearken, and 

dash along with heedless impulsiveness, 

He is deeply grieved, and has to call in the 

loud and painful tones of trial and 

chastening.
How He bewails His ancient people for 

their refusing to listen to His living voice: 

"Oh, that my people had hearkened to my 

commandments, then had their peace 

been like a river, and their righteousness 

as the waves of the sea."
</li>
<li>
We grieve the Holy Spirit when, having 

heard, we presume to disobey His voice.
This is very serious, and full of terrible 

danger. It is an awful thing wilfully to 

neglect or defy the distinct command of 

the Holy Ghost. We cannot do it without 

losing the sense of His presence, and 

being conscious that He has withdrawn 

the manifestation of His love, until we 

deeply and penitently recognize our sin, 

and step into the path of obedience where 

we separated from His companionship.
</li>
<li>
Nothing grieves the Holy Spirit more than 

a divided heart and the cherishing of any 

idols in our affections which separate our 

supreme love from Christ.
There is a remarkable passage in the 

book of James which declares that "the 

Spirit which dwells in us loves us to 

jealousy" (marginal reading), and in the 

same connection it is added, "Ye 

adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not 

that the friendship of the world is enmity 

with God? that is, a heart set upon earthly 

things is guilty of spiritual adultery, the 

Holy Ghost looks upon it with jealous love, 

grieved and insulted by the dishonour 

done to our divine husband by our 

unfaithful affections.
</li>
<li>
We grieve the Holy Spirit whenever we 

neglect, pervert, or dishonour the Holy 

Scriptures.
This is His word, and not one utterance or 

one jot shall fall to the ground. How we 

grieve Him when we explain its precious 

promises, and make of none effect its 

exact commands; and how He loves the 

heart that feeds upon the truth and 

honours the Bible in its least promise and 

command!
</li>
<li>
Especially do we grieve the Holy Ghost 

when we dishonour Jesus, or let anything 

separate us from Him, or cloud our 

conception of Him, and interrupt our 

devotion to Him.
He is jealous for the honour of Christ; 

therefore, whenever self, or any human 

being comes between us and Christ, 

whenever the glory of the Master is 

obscured by the glory of the servant, 

whenever even truth or work becomes 

more distinct than Christ Himself, the 

Holy Ghost is grieved; and He is pleased 

when we exalt the Saviour, and give Him 

all the glory.
</li>
<li>
The Holy Spirit is grieved when we ignore 

Him. He longs after our love and trust.
</li>
<li>
The Holy Spirit is especially grieved by a 

spirit of bitterness toward any human 

being, and therefore the apostle says, 

"Let all bitternesses, and wrath, and 

anger, and clamour, and evil speaking be 

put away from you with all malice. And 

grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby 

we are sealed unto the day of 

redemption."
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>
We May Resist the Holy Spirit.
</h2>
<p>
This has special reference to the attitude 

of the unbeliever, with whom the Holy 

Ghost is striving with a view to convict 

him of sin and lead Him to the Saviour.
<ul>
<li>The sinner resists the Holy Spirit 

when he tries to shake off religious 

impressions.
This may be done in many ways. 

Sometimes the soul, under the Spirit's 

striving, tries to quench its impressions in 

pleasure, excitement or business. 

Sometimes it treats them as nervous 

depression, low spirits or ill-health, and 

seeks a remedy in change of scene or 

thought; very often it resorts to light 

reading, worldly amusements, frivolous 

society, perhaps indulgence in sin, and 

the devil always has plenty of auxiliaries 

to suggest distracting thoughts, and help 

to dispel the sacred influences that God is 

gathering around the heart.
Very often it will become provoked and 

offended with some acts on the part of 

Christians, sometimes perhaps 

connected with the religious services, and 

will resolve to give up attending, or find 

some petty excuse for getting out of the 

way of the influences that are troubling its 

content. All these efforts to escape are 

but the stronger evidence of the Spirit's 

striving, and He patiently and lovingly 

continues to press the arrow still more 

keenly into the wounded heart, until it is 

laid prostrate at the feet of love.
</li>
<li>
The sinner resists the influences of the 

Holy Spirit in leading him to conviction of 

sin.
It is not enough to awaken concern in the 

soul, and even alarm-there must be a 

distinct working of Scriptural conviction in 

order to secure lasting peace and sound 

conversion; and, therefore, the Holy 

Ghost has promised to convict the world 

of sin.
He does this by bringing before the 

conscience the memory of actual 

transgressions-the recollection of any 

forgotten sins, the iniquities of youth and 

childhood, the secret sins known to God 

only, the aggravations of sin, the warnings 

and light against which it has been 

committed, the love that has been 

resisted, the threatening of the divine law, 

the unchangeable holiness of the divine 

character, the tremendous sentence 

against all iniquity, the deep inward 

consciousness of guilt, the still more 

terrible sense of the wickedness of the 

sinner's heart, the hopeless depravity, the 

consciousness of wilfulness and unbelief, 

and the dreadful fear of its hopelessness, 

the impossibility of its salvation.
Thus the Great Advocate sets in array our 

transgressions, until the heart seeks 

some escape from itself, and Satan is 

ready to suggest a thousand excuses, 

palliations and false hopes, through which 

the guilty spirit seeks to evade the force of 

its conviction.
It thinks of the faults of others, and 

plausibly reasons that it is no worse than 

they; it eagerly seizes upon the 

inconsistencies of Christians, and tries to 

excuse itself by their failure; it recalls its 

own miserable attempts at goodness, 

and tries to find some comfort in its own 

righteousness; it seeks false refuge in the 

mercy of God, and eagerly tries to 

persuade itself that the picture of Christ's 

anger against sin, and the stories of 

judgement and perdition, are fictions of 

obsolete theology.
It says peace, peace, when there is no 

peace, and heals slightly its hurt, resisting 

with all its might the blessed Spirit, who 

wounds only that He may heal.
Happy they who fail in the foolish attempt, 

and in whose hearts the arrows of the 

King are so sharp and keen that the 

wound can never be staunched save by 

the blood of Calvary.
</li>
<li>
The sinner resists the work of the Holy 

Ghost in leading him to decision.
Even after he has been driven from his 

previous refuges, and has been 

awakened to his profound concern, and 

thoroughly convicted of his sin, and fully 

admits the claims of religion and the 

justness of his condemnation, he seeks 

another door of escape in procrastination.
He will surrender, he will resist no more, 

he will accept the Saviour, but not now, 

he is not quite ready yet.
Perhaps he argues that he does not feel 

strongly enough, that he wants a deeper 

conviction, more light, a little more 

deliberate consideration, perhaps a little 

more time to alter his circumstances and 

change his life; but really what he is 

pleading for is a reprieve for his sinful 

heart, a little longer in the indulgence of 

his self-will, and disobedience to the 

gospel.
And his course is just as dangerous and 

just as truly a rejection of Christ as if he 

did it deliberately and directly; while at the 

same time it has the self-deceiving 

aspect of being a sort of yielding, at least 

a nominal consent, to all the pleadings of 

the Holy Ghost. He is resisting the Spirit, 

and his to-morrow often means, as the 

eyes of heaven read the words, NEVER.
</li>
<li>
The sinner resists the Holy Spirit in His 

gracious attempts to convict the soul of 

righteousness and lead it to believe on the 

Son of God.
The Spirit's object is not merely to 

produce concern, alarm, and even the 

profoundest repentance, but the blessed 

goal of all His gracious movements is the 

trust trustful acceptance of Jesus, and 

the believing assurance of His 

forgiveness and salvation.
It is here that Satan and self-will fight their 

hardest battle. The soul will consent to 

live a better life, will be willing to weep and 

mourn, will do anything rather than accept 

the very gift of salvation and believe the 

naked word of God, that its sins are 

forgiven for His name's sake, and that it is 

accepted in Jesus Christ, as He is 

accepted.
How desperately it fights against this 

simple act, clothing its unbelief in the 

guise of humanity and modesty, and 

thinking it presumption to dare to make 

such a claim!
Many souls hold back at this point for 

months and years, and know not that in 

all their doubts and fears, their hard 

thoughts of themselves and of God, they 

are simply resisting the Holy Ghost, who 

is striving with them to lay their sins 

forever at the feet of Jesus, and go forth 

into His everlasting peace.
</li>
<li>
It is possible for the soul to resist the Holy 

Ghost openly, directly, wilfully, and 

presumptuously, until it drives Him from 

its door and commits the fatal sin of 

wilfully rejecting the offered Saviour in the 

full light of the Holy Spirit's revealing, and 

perhaps with the full consciousness that it 

is defiantly refusing God.
There is such a thing referred to in the 

Scriptures, "If ye refuse and rebel ye shall 

be destroyed;" "I called and ye refused." 

"If we sin wilfully after that we have 

received the knowledge of the truth, there 

remains no more sacrifice for sins, but a 

certain fearful looking for of judgement 

and fiery indignation, which shall devour 

the adversaries. He that despised Moses' 

law died without mercy under two or three 

witnesses. Of how much sorer 

punishment. suppose ye, shall he be 

thought worthy who has trodden under 

foot the Son of God, and has counted the 

blood of the covenant, wherewith he was 

sanctified, an unholy thing, and has done 

despite unto the Spirit of grace? For we 

know Him that has said, Vengeance 

belongs unto me, I will recompense, says 

the Lord. And again, The Lord shall judge 

His people. It is a fearful thing to fall into 

the hands of the living God."
The blasphemy of the Pharisees against 

the Holy Ghost seems to have consisted 

in rejecting Jesus after they had sufficient 

light to know that He was the Son of God.
It was, therefore, not only the rejection of 

Jesus, but the deliberate rejection of the 

Holy Ghost and His witness to Jesus, 

when they knew it to be His witness.
Essentially, therefore, it is the same sin 

as any soul may now commit, when in 

the full light of God, and conscious that 

He has directly called it to accept the 

Saviour, it defiantly refuses.
The effect of such an act may be, and 

perhaps usually is, the withdrawal of the 

Spirit from the soul until it is left, past 

feeling, to a hardened heart, and a doom 

on which the voice of divine appeal and 

the light of mercy will never fall again.
This is, perhaps, what is meant by the 

blasphemy against the Holy Ghost which 

never has forgiveness.
Let no one think he has committed this 

sin if still in the heart there is a willingness 

to yield to God and accept the Saviour.
If there is even a fear that any reader may 

have committed this sin, and a great 

longing that it may not be so, rejoice 

exceedingly, and yield this moment even 

to His faint touch of heavenly influence, 

lest it should be withdrawn, and the soul 

left under the sad sentence, "He is joined 

to his idols, let him alone." 
Oh! let us be fearful and careful lest we 

sin against the Holy Ghost by quenching 

the Spirit, by grieving the Holy One, by 

resisting our best Friend, or by 

blaspheming His mighty name.
