 	<h1>The Holy One</h1>
<p>
Isaiah caught a dramatic vision of the Lord’s holiness in the year King Uzziah died. The good king Uzziah had died and vacated the throne but the Lord God was reigning and seated on his throne. Kingdoms and governments rise and fall, come and go, but God’s throne is unshakable, high and exalted. Uzziah’s entombment was powerfully contrasted with God’s enthronement. The earthly king was buried in his regal robes but the fringe of the heavenly king’s robe blanketed the whole temple.</p>
<h3>
Holy, holy, holy
</h3> 
<p>
The mere mention of God and presence of His holiness caused a huge commotion and a choir outbreak among angels in heavens and on earth. According to the orthodox view, the seraphs stand at the head of the nine choirs of angels. Surrounding the seat of the enthroned Lord, they ranked ahead of cherubim that carried the chariot of the divine throne. The radiance of God’s holiness was too luminous for the seraphs to bear and too wondrous to behold, so much so that they covered their faces, eyes and feet, breaking out in chorus, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory.” Holiness is the very essence, foundation and core of His Being.</p>
<h3>
Encountering God’s Holy presence
</h3> 
<p>
How should men response to God’s holiness? Is His holiness for show? What should our attitude be in the presence of the Holy One? 
Confession is Required of the Sinner.</p>
<p>
How do you behave encountering God’s holy presence? Do you say “wow” or “woe” before Him? Unlike the gods of the nations, the God of Israel is holy. 
The right response to His holiness is not joy, celebration, ecstasy, applause or approval, but alarm, terror, fright, horror, unease, submission, even dismay. Holiness is intrinsic to God and inseparable from God. There is no sin, impurity or blemish in Him – not even a spot or a speck. His thoughts, acts and decisions are 100% righteous and wholesome. There is not the least shortcoming or deficiency or weakness in Him. God is opposed to and cannot be associated with uncleanness, defilement and sin. The seraphs could not find a way to describe or express God’s holiness, except to repeat it three times – “holy, holy, holy,” the first continuous three-fold repetition of the word in the Bible. Praising His holiness and singing His praise are never tiresome, tedious or terrifying to them. The Bible says there is a beauty or splendour to His holiness (1 Chron 16:29, Ps 29:2, 96:9).</p>
