<h1>   
Who created God?</h1>
<p><img src="../../../images/content/cloudwithlightrays.jpg" width="220" height="150" alt="" hspace="50" border="0" align="right" />
A number of skeptics ask this question. But God by definition is the uncreated creator of the universe, so the question Who created God? is illogical, just like To whom is the bachelor married?</p>
<p>
So a more sophisticated questioner might ask: If the universe needs a cause, then why doesn't God need a cause? And if God doesn't need a cause, why should the universe need a cause? In reply, Christians should use the following reasoning:</p>

<p>
	1. Everything which has a beginning has a <font size="+1">cause.</font></p>
	<p>2. The universe has a <font size="+1">beginning.</font> </p>
	<p>3. <font size="+1">Therefore the universe has a cause.</font></p>

<p>
Its important to stress the words in bold type. The universe requires a cause because it had a beginning, as will be shown below. God, unlike the universe, had no beginning, so doesn't need a cause. In addition, Einstein's general relativity, which has much experimental support, shows that time is linked to matter and space. So time itself would have begun along with matter and space.<img src="../../../images/content/clockdistortion.jpg" width="140" height="141" alt="" hspace="50" border="0" align="right" /></p>
<p>
Since God, by definition, is the creator of the whole universe, he is the creator of time. Therefore He is not limited by the time dimension He created, so has no beginning in time God is <dr class="alt5">... the High and Lofty One Who inhabits eternity, <br>(Isa 57:15)</dr class="alt5">. Therefore He doesn't have a cause.</p>
<p>
In contrast, there is good evidence that the universe had a beginning. This can be shown from the Laws of Thermodynamics, the most fundamental laws of the physical sciences.</p>
<p class="block"><font color="firebrick">
1st Law: The<i><font size="+1"> total amount</font></i> of mass-energy in the universe is <i><font size="+1">constant</font></i>.<br /><br />

2nd Law: The amount of energy<i><font size="+1"> available for work</font></i> is running out, or entropy is increasing to a maximum.</font></p>
<p>
If the total amount of mass-energy is limited, and the amount of usable energy is decreasing, then the universe cannot have existed forever, otherwise it would already have exhausted all usable energy the heat death of the universe. For example, all radioactive atoms would have decayed, every part of the universe would be the same temperature, and no further work would be possible.</p>
<p>
So the obvious corollary is that the universe began a finite time ago with a lot of usable energy, and is now running down.</p>
<p>
Now, what if the questioner accepts that the universe had a beginning, but not that it needs a cause? But it is self-evident that things that begin have a cause no-one really denies it in his heart. All science and history would collapse if this law of cause and effect were denied. So would all law enforcement, if the police didn't think they needed to find a cause for a stabbed body or a burgled house.</p>
<p>
Also, the universe cannot be self-caused nothing can create itself, because that would mean that it existed before it came into existence, which is a logical absurdity.</p>
<h4>
In Summary</h4>

<ul>
	<li>The universe (including time itself) can be shown to have had a beginning.</li>
	<li>It is unreasonable to believe something could begin to exist without a cause.</li>
	<li>The universe therefore requires a cause, just as Genesis 1:1 and Romans 1:20 teach.</li>
	<li>God, as creator of time, is outside of time. Since therefore He has no beginning in time, He has always existed, so doesn't need a cause.</li>
</ul>
