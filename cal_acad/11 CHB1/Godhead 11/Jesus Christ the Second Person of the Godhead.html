 	<h1>Jesus Christ -<br> Second Person of the Godhead </h1>
<p>
Now that we are beginning to understand that the One God, whose name is unknown, exists as Three Persons, we can begin to get a grasp The Second Person of the Godhead, Jesus Christ. What makes knowing Jesus so critical? He is the only One who has come from God, literally!</p>
<p>
First, Jesus is the Second Person of the One God. In calling Him the Second Person, we don’t mean order of authority, but in order of revelation. We see glimpses of Jesus in Genesis 1:26, when God speaks and says, Let Us make man in our own image. It is clear that the One God is referring to Himself when He says Us. That peek into God’s creation shows us that He was talking to the Son of God and the Holy Spirit. He could not be referring to the angels, read Hebrews 1:13-14.</p>
<p>
Second, Jesus existed before He came to the earth. John the Baptist mentions this when he is proclaiming to those he was baptising, the man coming after to me is superior to me because He was before me (my paraphrase)(John 1:30) . John the Baptist was referring to Jesus’ pre-existence since John was born before Jesus was born. There are more than a few verses that reinforce that Jesus existed before His earthly birth (John 1:1 etc).</p>
<p>
Here are some more things you can learn about The Person of the Son of God:
