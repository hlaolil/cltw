   <h1>The Name of God Almighty</h1>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty, but by My name LORD I was not known to them. (Ex 6:3 )</dr class='alt5'><p>
<p>
The revelation of this name to Abram <dr class='alt5'>the Lord appeared to Abram and said to him, “I am Almighty God; walk before Me and be blameless. (Gen 17:1) </dr class='alt5'>  and  for its repetition to Jacob <dr class='alt5'> God said to him: “I am God Almighty. (Gen 35:11)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p> 
We do not find the full name used by God in any appearance to Isaac; but Isaac himself uses it <dr class='alt5'>" May God Almighty bless you (Gen 28:3.)</dr class='alt5'> </p>
<p><dr class='alt5'>
"By My name Lord was I not known to them".</dr class='alt5'> The explanation of this passage is by no means easy.<br> God Himself, said to him,<dr class='alt5'> “I am the Lord, (Gen 15:7) </dr class='alt5'>revealing Himself to Abraham as Lord before declaring His name to be El-Shaddai (God Almighty); and again revealed Himself to Jacob as  <dr class='alt5'>“... the Lord God of Abraham <br> (Gen 28:13).</dr class='alt5'> <br>Abraham named the place where he had been about to sacrifice Isaac, <dr class='alt5'><br>"The-Lord-Will-Provide" (Gen22:14).</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p> That Moses regarded the Name as known even earlier, <dr class='alt5'>“Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, and said, “I have acquired a man from the Lord.” (Gen 4:1)</dr class='alt5'> It was probably as old as language. The apparent meaning of the present passage cannot therefore be its true meaning. No writer would so contradict himself. Perhaps the true sense is, "I was known to them as a Being of Might and Power, not as mere absolute (and so eternal and immutable) existence."</p>
