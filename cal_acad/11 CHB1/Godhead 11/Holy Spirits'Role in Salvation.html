  <h1>
Holy Spirits'Role in Salvation
</h1>
<h3>
The Convincing Role of the Holy Spirit in 

Salvation
</h3>
<p>
When Jesus addressed His closest 

friends in the upper room on the eve of 

His crucifixion, He introduced them to the 

far-reaching ministry of the Holy Spirit — 

the "other" Comforter ("another" of the 

same essence), the blessed Paraclete. 

Among the roles God the Spirit exercises is is a very clear convincing role. <br><dr class='alt5'>And when He has come, He will convict the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgement: of sin, because they do not believe in Me; of righteousness, because I go to My Father and you see Me no more; of judgement, because the ruler of this world is judged. (John 16:8-11)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
"When we speak of elenctics (Elenctics, 

in Christianity, is a division of practical 

theology concerned with persuading 

people of other faiths (or no faith) of the 

truth of the Gospel message, with an end 

to producing in them an awareness of, 

and sense of guilt for, their sins, a 

recognition of their need for God`s 

forgiveness, ...) we do well to understand 

it in the sense that it has in John 16:8. 

The Holy Spirit will convince the world of 

sin. The Holy Spirit is actually the only 

conceivable subject of this verb, for the 

conviction of sin exceeds all human 

ability. Only the Holy Spirit can do this, 

even though He can and will use us as 

instruments in his hand."
</p>
<p>
The Holy Spirit, using the biblical 

message of the Cross, "awakens in man 

that deeply hidden awareness of guilt. He 

convinces man of sin, even where 

previously no consciousness of sin was 

apparently present. The Holy Spirit uses 

the word of the preacher and touches the 

heart of the hearer, making it accessible 

to the word."
</p>
<p>
When the Holy Spirit convinces people of 

their sin, of Jesus' righteousness, and of 

certain judgement, He awakens the 

human heart to hear and see truth in a 

new way. Upon seeing and perceiving (cf. 

Isaiah 6:10; Matthew 13:15), the human 

heart cries out for God.
</p>
<p>
In ancient times, Job experienced this first 

hand.<br><dr class='alt5'>Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know ... “I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees You. Therefore I abhor myself,
and repent in dust and ashes.”(Job 42:3, 5-6).
</p>
<p>
Before the Spirit of God awakened his 

heart, Job felt free to speak his mind to 

God. However, somewhere along the 

way, something transformational 

happened in his heart. He who had not 

seen, now saw. Why? The Spirit opened 

his eyes. He became convinced of his 

own finitude (The state of having limits or 

bounds) and of God's eternal majesty and 

glory. An awakening took place. How? To 

us it is a mystery, for only the Lord God 

can effect such change in the human 

heart. The whirlwind of God's Spirit 

confounded Job's every thought, directing 

him to see God and God alone. The wind 

had blown away every last vestige of 

earthly reliance and self-righteousness, 

and Job was changed.
</p>
<h3>
The Regenerating Role of the Holy Spirit 

in Salvation
</h3>
<p>
One of my mentors in ministry was fond 

of saying something like this:
"It is an amazing thing. You can preach 

the same sermon to the same people in 

the same way at the same place and get 

two totally different responses. The first 

time, something electric happens. People 

get saved. The movement of God is 

apparent. The next time, it seems as if 

nothing happens. No response, no 

energy, no movement. It is always a 

sobering reminder. It is not up to us. It is 

solely up to Him."</p>
<p>
After multiple hearings of the Gospel, or 

perhaps after only one hearing of the 

message, something happens — "a 

motive force inherent in the coming of 

God in his word ... activates the person 

on whom it is focused, so that that person 

begins to change."What before had 

been heard merely as words is now an 

urgent, unrelenting, gale-force wind, 

against which there seems to be no 

resistance, a transforming presence 

demanding a response. The human 

heart, being stripped bare of all pretence, 

clearly sees — and responds in 

repentance and faith. What has happened 

is more than mere illumination, although 

illumination is certainly part of it. The Spirit 

of God bursts forth into the 

consciousness of the hearer and calls 

forth a responsive awareness-an 

awareness of our desperate neediness 

placed against the awful, yet wonderful, 

substitutionary sacrifice of Jesus on the 

Cross. Hearing, seeing, and perceiving, 

we respond in repentance and trust. We 

are driven to our knees before Him in awe 

and wonder and worship.
</p>
<h3>
The Adopting Role of the Holy Spirit in 

Salvation
</h3>
<p>
When Ruth implored Naomi, <dr class='alt5'>“Entreat me not to leave you, or to turn back from following after you; for wherever you go, I will go; and wherever you lodge, I will lodge; Your people shall be my people,and your God, my God.(Ruth 1:16)</dr class='alt5'>, she touched 

on a fundamental human need: the need 

for community, for relationship, for identity 

— the need to have a place, to belong, to 

be accepted.
</p>
<p>
This is precisely the kind of covenantal 

relationship the Heavenly Father offers 

through the sacrifice of Jesus on the 

Cross. Perhaps the most comforting 

aspect of our relationship with the King, 

the Creator of the Universe, is this 

promise, I will be your God; you shall be 

my people (see, for example, Exodus 6:7; 

Leviticus 26:12; Isaiah 40:1; 51:22; 

multiple reminders in Jeremiah 7:23; 11:4; 

24:7; 30:22; the new covenant, Jeremiah 

31:33; 32:38; Ezekiel 11:20; 14:11; 34:30; 

36:28; 37:23-27; Joel 2:26-27; Zechariah 

8:8; 9:16; 2 Corinthians 6:16; Hebrews 

8:10; Revelation 21:3).
</p>
<p>
In the ministry of the prophet Hosea, his 

life served as a divine object lesson of 

Israel's unfaithfulness to the LORD. His 

younger children received names that 

cause our hearts to cringe in sadness 

and horror — 

"Not-Having-Obtained-Mercy" 

(Lo-Ruhamah, Hosea 1:6) and 

"Not-My-People" (Lo-Ammi, Hosea 1:8). 

These names were reminders not only of 

Hosea's wife's unfaithfulness to him, but 

of Israel's spiritual adultery against the 

LORD. Years later, after the first advent 

of our Saviour, the aged Peter drew from 

Hosea's experience to remind believers in 

Jesus Christ that we who had not 

obtained mercy have now obtained 

mercy; we who once were not a people, 

are now the people of God (1 Peter 2:10, 

KJV). We uniquely belong to the Lord as 

His "peculiar" people (see Exodus 19:5; 

Titus 2:14; and 1 Peter 2:9) — for 

time and eternity — through the agency of 

adoption.
</p>
<p>
The Apostle Paul introduced this adoptive aspect of our salvation in two key texts.<br> 
In Romans he puts it this way: <dr class='alt5'> For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again to fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, “Abba, Father.” The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God, (Romans 8:15-16)</dr class='alt5'><br> In Galatians he penned it this way, <dr class='alt5'>But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law, to redeem those who were under the law, that we might receive the adoption as sons. And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, “Abba, Father!” Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, then an heir of God through Christ. (Galatians 4:4-7).
</p>
<p>
The Holy Spirit places the newly born 

follower of Christ into the spiritual family 

— the family of God. Then the Spirit puts 

a new song in the heart of every child of 

God (see Ephesians 4:17-20 and Psalm 

40:3) and confers upon the believer an 

intimacy with the Father that is wholly 

undeserved. We who were not a people 

now have an "Abba, Father!" relationship 

with the King of the ages. This mediating 

work of the Holy Spirit elicits praise and 

thanksgiving in the heart of the true 

believer in Jesus. And yet, for all of this, 

there is more.
</p>
<h3>
The Sealing Role of the Holy Spirit in 

Salvation
</h3>
<p>
The Holy Spirit serves as the guarantor <dr class='alt5'>that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ; (Philippians 1:6).</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
This "seal" of the Holy Spirit is specifically 

referenced in three New Testament texts 

— 2 Corinthians 1:21, 22; Ephesians 

1:13; and Ephesians 4:30. The sealing 

metaphor has a variety of meanings. 

Things were (and are) sealed to indicate 

ownership. Seals also were (and are) 

used to guarantee the security of 

something in transit (see Romans 15:28). 

This is one reason Southern Baptists 

cling so tenaciously to the eternal security 

of believers, for when Paul wrote these 

words the readers understood the seal on 

an item in transit could only be broken by 

the recipient upon arrival; thus the true 

believer is guaranteed safe arrival to that 

eternal destiny. In addition, seals were 

(and are) used to guarantee the quality of 

goods. Finally, seals did (and do) provide 

proof of identity (see Romans 4:11).
</p>
<p>
What Paul is saying is that God's gift to 

us of the Holy Spirit here and now is an 

instalment, a guarantee, an advance 

foretaste of the life which the Christian will 

some day live when he lives in the 

presence of God.
The Spirit as the present earnest promise 

of our future inheritance, guarantees our 

complete, final salvation, i.e. eternal 

communion with God. In the sealing of the 

believer, the Holy Spirit is given to the 

human heart as an earnest promise. The 

future reality represented by the earnest 

promise of the Spirit appears in 2 

Corinthians 5:5 as the 'house' expected 

from heaven which will one day replace 

the 'tent' of our earthly body."
</p>
<p>
Pointing to the theological significance of 

the interplay of the "seal" and the "down 

payment" in 2 Corinthians 1:21-22, David 

Garland observed, "It guarantees that our 

relationship with God is not something 

ephemeral but permanent and will 

continue beyond our death." He further 

noted, "Believers do not receive a portion 

of the Holy Spirit, but the Spirit Himself is 

the instalment that gives a foretaste and 

assures the glory that is to come."
</p>
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
Of course, the Holy Spirit works in the life 

of the believer in many other ways — 

equipping for service, gifting for specific 

ministries, bestowing joy, strengthening 

for a lifetime of growth in grace, 

conforming the believer more and more 

into the full stature of Christ, and 

completing the work of sanctification. 

Once His wind begins to blow upon the 

frail bark of our lives, He will continually fill 

our sails and our souls with His presence, 

His love, His grace, and His compassion. 

He will encourage us as the Comforter. 

He will fill our hearts with song. He will be 

our God. We shall be His people.
