<h1>
What Christ's Death accomplished
</h1>
<p>
Here’s a very brief summary of core things Christ accomplished in His death.
</p>
<h3>
Expiation
</h3>
<p>
Expiation means the removal of our sin and guilt. Christ’s death removes — expiates — our sin and guilt. The guilt of our sin was taken away from us and placed on Christ, who discharged it by His death.<br>
Thus, in John 1, John the Baptist calls Jesus<dr class='alt5'> “The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!” (John 1:29)</dr class='alt5'> <br> Likewise, Isa 53 says, <dr class='alt5'>“And the Lord has 
laid on Him the iniquity of us all” <br>(Isa 53:6)</dr class='alt5'> <br>and Heb 9 says <dr class='alt5'>“He has appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of Himself.”<br> (Heb 9:26)</dr class='alt5'><br>
Jesus takes away, that is, expiates, our sins.
</p>
<h3>
Propitiation
</h3>
<p>
Whereas expiation refers to the removal of our sins, propitiation refers to the removal of God’s wrath.
By dying in our place for our sins, Christ removed the wrath of God that we justly deserved. In fact, it goes even further: a propitiation is not simply a sacrifice that removes wrath, but a sacrifice that removes wrath and turns it into favour. (Note: a propitiation does not turn wrath into love — God already loved us fully, which is the reason He sent Christ to die; it turns His wrath into favour so that His love may realise its purpose of doing good to us every day, in all things, forever, without sacrificing His justice and holiness.)</p>
<p>
Several passages speak of Christ’s death as a propitiation for our sins. <br>Rom 3 says <dr class='alt5'>“whom God set forth as a propitiation by His blood, through faith, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance God had passed over the sins that were previously committed, to demonstrate at the present time His righteousness, that He might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus ...” (Rom 3:25-26)</dr class='alt5'><br>
Likewise, Heb 2 says that Christ made <dr class='alt5'>“propitiation for the sins of the people” <br>(Heb 2:17)</dr class='alt5'> <br> and 1 John 4 says <dr class='alt5'>“In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins.” (1 John 4:10) 
</p>
<h3>
Reconciliation
</h3>
<p>
Whereas expiation refers to the removal of our sins, and propitiation refers to the removal of God’s wrath, reconciliation refers to the removal of our alienation from God.
Because of our sins, we were alienated – separated — from God. Christ’s death removed this alienation and thus reconciled us to God.<br>We see this, for example, in Rom 5<dr class='alt5'> “For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.” (Rom 5:10)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>
Redemption
</h3>
<p>
Our sins had put us in captivity from which we need to be delivered. The price that is paid to deliver someone from captivity is called a “ransom.” To say that Christ’s death accomplished redemption for us means that it accomplished deliverance from our captivity through the payment of a price.</p>
<p>There are three things we had to be released from: the curse of the law, the guilt of sin, and the power of sin. Christ redeemed us from each of these.
<p>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law:<dr class='alt5'> “Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us” (Gal 3:13-14).</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>Christ redeemed us from the guilt of our sin. We are <dr class='alt5'> “being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,” (Rom 3:24)<dr class='alt5'> .</p>
<p>
Christ redeemed us from the power of sin:<dr class='alt5'>  “knowing that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, like silver or gold, from your aimless conduct received by tradition from your fathers, but with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot” (1 Peter 1:18-19)<dr class='alt5'> .</p>
<p>
Note that we are not simply redeemed from the guilt of sin; to be redeemed from the power of sin means that our slavery to sin is broken. We are now free to live to righteousness. Our redemption 
from the power of sin is thus the basis of our ability to live holy lives: <dr class='alt5'>“For you were bought at a price; therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God’s.” (1 Cor 6:20).</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>
Defeat of the Powers of Darkness
</h3>
<p>
Christ’s death was a defeat of the power of Satan.<dr class='alt5'> <br>“Having disarmed principalities and powers, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in it.” (Col 2:15).</dr class='alt5'></p><p> Satan’s only weapon that can ultimately hurt people is unforgiven sin. Christ took this weapon away from him for all who would believe, defeating him and all the powers of darkness in his death by, as the verse right before this says,<dr class='alt5'>  “having wiped out the handwriting of requirements (our trespasses) that was against us, which was contrary to us. And He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross” (Col 2:14).</dr class='alt5'> 
</p>
<h3>
And He Did All of This By Dying As Our Substitute
</h3>
<p>
The reality of substitution is at the heart of the atonement. Christ accomplished all of the above benefits for us by dying in our place – that is, by dying instead of us. We deserved to die, and He took our sin upon Him and paid the penalty Himself.</p>
<p>This is what it means that <dr class='alt5'>Christ died for us (Rom 5:8)</dr class='alt5'></p><p><dr class='alt5'and gave Himself for us (Gal 2:20).</dr class='alt5' As Isaiah says, <dr class='alt5'>“But He was wounded for our transgressions, He was bruised for our iniquities ... and the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all” (Isa 53:5-6).</dr class='alt5'></p><p>
You see the reality of substitution underlying all of the benefits discussed above, as the means by which Christ accomplished them. For example, substitution is the means by which we were ransomed: <dr class='alt5'>“just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many” (Matt 20:28)</dr class='alt5'>. Christ’s death was a ransom for us — that is, instead of us. </p>
<p>
Likewise, Paul writes that <dr class='alt5'>“Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us ” (Gal 3:13).</dr class='alt5'></p><p>
Substitution is the means by which we were reconciled:<dr class='alt5'> “For Christ also suffered once for sins, the just for the unjust, that He might bring us to God” <br>(1 Peter 3:18).</dr class='alt5'> </p><p>It is the means of expiation: <dr class='alt5'>“For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him” (2 Cor 5:21)</dr class='alt5'> and <dr class='alt5'>“who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness” (1 Peter 2:24).</dr class='alt5'> </p><p>And by dying in our place, taking the penalty for our sins upon Himself, Christ’s death is also the means of propitiation.
</p>
<p>
Two implications.<br> First, this is very humbling.<br>
Second, <dr class='alt5'>“Greater love has no one than this, than to lay down one’s life for his friends” (John 15:13).<dr class='alt5'></p>
