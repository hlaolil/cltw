   <h1>Paul's take on Benediction</h1>
<p>
<h2Grace</h2>

When these words were penned Paul had been a Christian believer for upwards  of  twenty years,  but  life had not lost its zest, nor had the tempo  of  his service settled down  to  the level of quiet religious respectability. He was still profoundly conscious  of  his debt.
He still rejoiced  in  the experience of grace. The word thrilled him.
It  contained the very music of heaven for his soul as he pondered the old past and contrasted  it  with the present.  It  saturated his thought and dominated his mind. Paul was veritably " dyed  in  the wool " of grace.  More  than any other word.  it  enshrined  his  Gospel.  What did he discover in it?
<ol>
<li>Undeserved favour.  He was very conscious  that  God  had not
dealt with him after his sins nor rewarded him according to his wickedness. Like the Prodigal, Paul's reception was beyond his expectation
or imagination. The proud, stiff-necked, blaspheming Pharisee had
been treated with unspeakable forbearance and mercy. The rebel and.
despiser had been received as son and heir.</li>
<li>Ever-present Help.  Grace did not expend its resources in  that original condescension. Forgiveness and restoration to the Father's favour were followed  by  the constant loading of his life with the divine bounty.  Had  Paul given us his autobiography (and what an enrichment  of  every minister's library  that  would have been) he might well have forestalled Bunyan and called  it  " Grace Abounding ", for the word has the character of a refrain running through his whole life.
Whether he was thinking of the normal development of the " man in Christ " or of some particular victory won over circumstances without or fears within, he invariably attributed all to grace. " By the grace of God I am what I am."</li>
<li>Transformation  of  Life and Character.  The word has a fundamental meaning of beauty of form.  It  suggests not only rugged  truth but  truth  moulded upon lines  that  delight the eye.  It  speaks not only  of  holiness  but  of a certain becoming beauty  that  accompanies it. It  reminds us  that  when grace has had her perfect work "  we  shall be like  Him".</li></p></ol>

<h2>Love</h2>
<p>
Paul learned the meaning of love from a specific experience of  its action in the soul. Love confronted him as he pursued his mission of hate towards Damascus. Love in  God  was no abstract general principle deducible from one's observations of nature or providence.  It  was not  an  expression akin to  "the  good  God"  of reverent philosophical contemplation. Paul's eyes had been turned to the Cross. There on the Tree  of  Shame he saw love in  its  essence,
and when he turned his eyes again  it  was to be seen  that  they shone  with
the light of wonder, love and praise.  That  Cross  demonstrated God's Love  for  all-and  for him. <dr class='alt5'>"He loved me, and gave Himself for me."</dr class='alt5'> Here was the balm for the troubled conscience. Here alone was the fountain for sin and uncleanness. Here was the assurance  that  all things do work together for good  to  them who love  God-in  spite of  all the crushing problems of our world. Nor is this any sentimental, soothing syrup to deceive us from seeing the worst,  but  the taking  up into Himself  of  the whole weight and wounding of  sin-<dr class='alt5'>"in His own body on the tree".</dr class='alt5'>  With this  assurance-but  surely not otherwise
-life  in ancient Corinth or modern Manchester becomes not only  a possibility  but  a glorious triumph.</p>
<p>
<h2>Fellowship</h2>  
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>"My  Spirit abides among you, fear you not."</dr class='alt5'>  In these words  we  see  that  the Old Order was not ignorant of the inwardness and immediacy of religion pure and undefiled. <dr class='alt5'>"He shall testify of  Me ... He shall take  of  Mine  and reveal it to you </dr class='alt5'> is the  New Testament counterpart. The life  of  God in the soul of man is ever the mark  of  genuine faith. And until this takes place  we  remain mere spectators on the balcony instead  of  participators in the arena  of  the great drama  of  our most holy faith. Until the Spirit speaks and works in us, the Father's love is afar off  in  the recesses  of  the everlasting hills and the grace of Christ is embalmed  in  the pages  of  history. But  at His touch they  start  into life, for  it  is His work  to  create, maintain and communicate those very things to our souls. He witnesses with our spirit  that  we  are the sons of  God  and joint-heirs with Christ.</p>
