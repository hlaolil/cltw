 	<h1>The Holy Spirit and the Father</h1>
<p>
<h3>The Holy Spirit Is God</h3>
<p>

The Holy Spirit is the all-knowing, all-seeing, everywhere-present God. <br>Acts 5:3–4 teaches us that the Holy Spirit is God. Remember the story of Ananias and Sapphira? Before Ananias was struck dead, Peter told him, <dr class='alt5'><br
>“Why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit? ... You have not lied to men; but to God.”</dr class='alt5'> <p class='block'><dr class='alt1'> From this event we can see that lying to the Holy Spirit is the same as lying to God; therefore, the Holy Spirit is God.</p>
<p>
There is more Scriptural evidence that the Holy Spirit is God.<br> We see from the Bible that:
The words of God are the words the Holy Spirit inspired.
We are the temple of God because the Spirit indwells us.<br>
The one born of the Spirit is said to be born of God.<br>
The Holy Spirit is God Himself, the third Person of the divine Trinity. Why is it so important to believe in the deity and person hood of the Holy Spirit? It is crucial because you cannot give Him the honour and respect that He deserves if you don’t consider Him a divine Person. In fact, I find it doubtful that someone can be saved while he denies the person hood and deity of the One who tries to draw him to salvation.</p>
<p>
<h3>The Holy Spirit Is Distinct from the Father and the Son</h3>
<p>

One person I talked to declared, “The Holy Spirit is Jesus.” Some people think that the Holy Spirit is actually the same Person as the Father and the Son. But the Scriptures clearly teach a distinction between the Persons of the Trinity.<br> For example, again and again in John 14–16, Jesus referred to a Helper (“Comforter” in the KJV) that He would send when He went back to the Father. This Helper would guide the disciples and teach them. If Jesus and the Holy Spirit were one and the same Person, Jesus' reference to the Holy Spirit as another Helper would not make sense. Jesus must have been referring to another Person distinct from Himself.<br>
Look at the account of Jesus' baptism. Here the Son is baptised; a voice from Heaven says, “This is my beloved Son”; and the Holy Spirit, like a dove, rests upon Jesus. All of this occurs simultaneously. All three of the members of the Trinity are seen here at the same time, obviously distinct from one another.<br>
As a distinct person, the Holy Spirit has lived in a loving relationship with the Father and Son from all eternity. God created us to participate in that love relationship. God wants us to enjoy fellowship with Him, as each member of the Trinity has enjoyed fellowship with each other from before the beginning of time.</p>
