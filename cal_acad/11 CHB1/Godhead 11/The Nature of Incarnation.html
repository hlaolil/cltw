 	<h1>The Nature of Incarnation</h1>
<h2>How could a Person be God and man?</h2>
<p>
The passage in Philippians 2, called the “hymn of Christ”, is one of the most important for the Incarnation:
<dr class='alt5'>Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bond servant, and coming in the likeness of men. And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross. Therefore God also has highly exalted Him and given Him the name which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those in heaven, and of those on earth, and of those under the earth, and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. (Phil 2:5–11)</p>
<p>
As we see from the above, Jesus already pre-existed the time when He was born. He was also God in His essential nature. Furthermore, He had no need to grasp equality with God, because He already had it.</p>
<h2>Emptying Himself</h2>
<p>
Jesus never ceased to be divine … He didn’t empty anything out of Himself, such as divine attributes; rather, He emptied himself. And He did so by … adding human nature to His divine nature, not taking away anything divine.</p>
<p>
It’s vital to understand that Jesus never ceased to be divine. Yes, this passage does refer to “emptying” (kenosis), but what does it actually say? “He emptied Himself by taking … ”. That is, He didn’t empty anything out of Himself, such as divine attributes; rather, He emptied himself. And He did so by taking. That is, it was a subtraction by means of adding—adding human nature to His divine nature, not taking away anything divine.</p>
<h2>Jesus came to die, so had to add human nature</h2>
<p>
This addition was indeed an emptying, since as a human being, Jesus was subject to all the things that humans are subject to, such hunger, tiredness, and temptation. The only difference is that not only was He without sin, He was incapable of sin.</p>
<p>
And like all humans, He was subject also to death. Indeed, this was the whole reason He came. This is even shown in the symbolism of certain events around the time. When He was born, he was wrapped in cloth, which in the context of the time and place, was burial cloth, as burial cloth was left in mangers. And almost two years later, when the Wise Men came, one of their gifts was myrrh, an important herb used in burial rites.</p>
<p>
However, because Jesus never lost His divinity, no one could have killed Him if He hadn’t laid down His own life. This is why He bowed His head first, then gave up His spirit on the cross; the usual order would be to die and muscles go limp and the head collapse. But in His divinity, He could not die.</p>
<h2>What about the divine powers?</h2>
<p>
What actually happened in the kenosis (the renunciation of the divine nature, at least in part, by Christ in the Incarnation) is that Jesus voluntarily surrendered the independent exercise (use) of divine powers without His Father’s authority. For example, this explains why Jesus, in His humanity, did not know the day or hour of His return, because it was the Father’s prerogative. However, He could immediately switch on these powers at will, e.g. to know what people were thinking.
</p>
<p>
But Jesus never surrendered such absolute divine attributes as His perfect goodness, truthfulness, mercy, etc. which is why He was not only without sin, but incapable of sin.</p>
<h2>
Jesus' preaching
</h2>
<p>
Also, what Jesus did preach, He proclaimed with absolute authority -<br>(Matt 24:35, 28:18), because He was speaking with the full authority of God the Father (John 5:30, 8:28), who is always omniscient. So if Genesis compromisers wish to accuse Jesus of error because of His humanity, they must logically charge God the Father with error as well. Or else, if Jesus taught an inerrant Bible and attributed His teaching to the Father and such teaching is wrong, Jesus must be a charlatan in a hopeless muddle.</p>
<p>
Where do you draw the line? If Jesus was wrong in His view of Scripture, maybe He was wrong in other areas too. Where does it end? After all, Jesus told Nicodemus: <dr class='alt5'>“If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?” (John 3:12)</dr class='alt5'> If Jesus was wrong about earthly things (like a recent creation and a global flood), was He also wrong about a heavenly thing like John 3:16, only four verses later? If not, why not? Who decides whether He is right or wrong? We must, so we become the authority instead of Jesus. And Scripture becomes a restaurant menu, where we choose only the parts that suit us, while we slide down to total unbelief.</p> 
<p>
This confuses adaptation to human finitude (limitation) with accommodation to human error: the former does not have as a logical consequence the latter. A mother might tell her four-year-old "you grew inside my tummy"—this is not false, but language simplified to the child’s level. Conversely, "the stork brought you" is an outright error. Similarly, God, the author of truth, used some simplified descriptions (e.g. using the earth as a reference frame, as modern scientists do today) and anthropomorphisms, but never error.
</p>
<h2>
Jesus pointed out mistaken views on Scripture
</h2>
<p>
Jesus often challenged His audience, so He would not have failed to point out their mistaken views on Scripture, if such they were.
If Jesus acquiesced in this error, maybe He did so elsewhere as well. Who ultimately decides when Jesus is acquiescing? We must, so once again, Jesus loses His authority.
Jesus did not just acquiesce to the views of His audience on the in errancy of Scripture, but was in fact reinforcing them.</p>
<h3>
Summary:
</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Jesus pre-existed creation, and never came into existence because He existed eternally. It was through Him that all created things came into existence.</li>
<li>This entails a plurality in the Godhead, which is taught even from Genesis, and this also enables God to be a "God of Love".</li>
<li>Our names have also been written in the Book of Life belonging to the Lamb, Jesus, from the foundation of the world.</li>
<li>As sinful creatures, this means that our sin must be punished by a Substitute who was human as we are, but divine to be our Saviour.</li>
<li>This required our Creator to add human nature to His divine nature.</li></ul>
<p>
Jesus never lost His divine attributes, which provide authority to His teachings on every subject.</p>
