   <h1>Resting in God’s Sovereignty</h1>
<p> 
In Psalm 103, a magnificent hymn of praise, David praises God for His blessings and compassion as a loving and forgiving father for his children (vs. 1-18). He concludes with a universal call for praise (vs. 19-22), but he begins this call with a declaration of God’s sovereignty (vs. 19) for it is God’s sovereignty that gives Him the absolute freedom to do what He does in His blessings and showing compassion to frail and temporal humanity (vs. 15-16).</p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>Psalm 103:15-19  As for man, his days are like grass; As a flower of the field, so he flourishes. For the wind passes over it, and it is gone, And its place remembers it no more.  But the mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting
On those who fear Him, And His righteousness to children’s children,  To such as keep His covenant, And to those who remember His commandments to do them.  The Lord has established His throne in heaven,And His kingdom rules over all.</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p> 
Have you ever thought about how the physical heavens literally rule over the earth? They can ruin us or bless us. Warm us or cool us. Burn us or freeze us. Make our crops productive or destroy them. We have learned that climate and atmospheric conditions affect not only our health, but psychological behaviour.</p>
<p.
And what are the heavens? They are the creation of God, but they also illustrate God’s sovereign majesty over our lives.</p>
<p>
Scriptures such as Psalm 103:19 often relate God to the heavens not because He is so far removed from us as to space, but because in His sovereign majesty He is so high above us in power, nature, and sovereignty.</p>
<p class='crb'>
One of our problems today is that we have lost the biblical perspective of the majestic greatness of God, and we have a completely wrong focus on God. As J. B. Phillips points out in his book, Your God Is Too Small, people today see God as: <br><br>(a) the resident policeman;<br><br> (b) the grand old man; <br><br>(c) a parental hangover, or some other short-sighted, twisted view of God.</p>
<h2>
God's Sovereignty 
</h2>
<p>
The sovereignty of God may be defined as the exercise of His supremacy, His infinite rule, His authority and power. Being infinitely elevated above the highest creature in authority, nature, and being, He is the Most High Lord of heaven and earth and all creation whether angels or the heavenly hosts.</p>
<p>
Basically, God’s sovereignty means that He is the Supreme Ruler who immanently and personally rules over all the affairs of the universe—and this includes our personal lives both as individuals and as a local body of believers. God’s sovereignty is a place of rest for the child of God, as well as a cause of worship (cf. Psa. 48:1; 95:3, 6).</p>
<p>
One particular place of rest and application in relation to God’s sovereignty and rule is His guidance and work to accomplish His purposes for our lives individually and corporately. Paul has this in mind, at least in part when he says: <dr class='alt5'>“being confident of this very thing, that He who has begun a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ” (Philippians 1:6)(Compare also Eph. 1:11-12)</dr class='alt5'></p>
