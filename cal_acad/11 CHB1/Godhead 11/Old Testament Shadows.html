Old Testament Shadows

<h3>
Images and pictures of the Trinity from the Old Testament
</h3>
<p>
I am reading these texts as a Christian in the light of the New Testament You the reader are free to decide if these texts really ARE images or hints of the Trinity from your perspective:
<ol>
<li>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness ... <br>(Gen 1:26)</dr class='alt5'>
<p>
So God speaks to Himself in the plural: “let us….our.” Some claim this is just an instance of the “Royal We” being used. Perhaps but I see an image of the Trinity. There is one (“God said”) but there is also a plural (us, our). Right at the very beginning in Genesis there is already a hint that God is not all by Himself, but is in a communion of love.
</li>
<li>
Elohim?? In the quote above, the word used for God is Elohim. Now it is interesting that this word is in a plural form. From the view point of pure grammatical form Elohim means “Gods.”<br> However, the Jewish people understood the sense of the word to be singular. Now this is a much debated point and you can read something more of it from a Jewish perspective here: Elohim as Plural yet Singular. (We have certain words like this in English, plural in form but singular in meaning: news, mathematics, acoustics, etc.).<br> My point here is not to try and understand it as a Jew from the 8th Century BC or a Jew today might understand it. Rather, what I observing is that it is interesting that one of the main words for God in the Old Testament is plural, yet singular, singular yet plural. It is one, it is also plural. God is one, yet He is three. I say this as a Christian observing this about one of the main titles of God. I see an image of the Trinity.

Then the Lord appeared to him by the terebinth trees of Mamre, as he was sitting in the tent door in the heat of the day. So he lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing by him; and when he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them, and bowed himself to the ground, and said, <dr class='alt5'>“My Lord, if I have now found favour in Your sight, do not pass on by Your servant. Please let a little water be brought, and wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree. And I will bring a morsel of bread,.” They said, “Do as you have said.” (Gen 18:1-5).</dr class='alt5'> <p>
Now this passage from a purely grammatical point of view is very difficult since we switch back and forth from singular references to plural. Note first that the Lord (singular) appeared to Abram. (In this case Yahweh (YHWH) is the name used for God). And yet what Abram sees is three men. Some have wanted to say, this is just God and two angels. But I see the Trinity being imaged or alluded to here. And yet when Abram address “them” he says, “My Lord” (singular). The “tortured” grammar continues as Abram asks that water be fetched so that he can “wash your feet” (singular) and that the “LORD” (singular) can rest yourselves (plural). The same thing happens in the next sentence where Abram wants to fetch bread that you (singular) may refresh yourselves (plural) In the end the LORD (singular) gives answer but it is rendered: “So they said” Plural, singular….. what is it? Both. God is one, God is three. For me, as a Christian, this is a picture of the Trinity. Since the reality of God cannot be reduced to words we have here a grammatically difficult passage. But I “see” what is going on. God is one and God is three, He is singular and yet is plural.

Now the Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the Lord. And the Lord passed before him and proclaimed, “The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, long suffering, and abounding in goodness and truth,(Exodus 34:5-6). </dr class='alt5'><p>  
Here we see that when God announces His name He does so in a threefold way: Lord! ... The Lord, the Lord. There is implicit a threefold introduction or announcement of God. Coincidence or of significance? You decide.
</li>
<li>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>
In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and the train of His robe filled the temple. Above it stood seraphim; each one had six wings: with two he covered his face, with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew. And one cried to another and said:
“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts; The whole earth is full of His glory!” (Isa 6:1-3)<dr class='alt5'><p> 
God is Holy, Holy, and yet again, Holy. Some say this is just a Jewish way of saying “very Holy” but as Christian I see more. I see a reference to each of the Three Persons. Perfect praise here requires three “holys”, why? all things are perfect in threes, but why? So, as a Christian I see the angels not just using the superlative but also praising each of the Three persons. God is three (Holy, Holy, Holy) and God is one, and so the text says, Holy<dr class='alt5'> ”IS the Lord.”</dr class='alt5'> Three declarations “Holy”: Coincidence or of significance? You decide.
</li>
<li><p>

In the New Testament there are obviously many references but let me just refer to three quickly. Jesus says, <dr class='alt5'>I and My Father are one.” (John 10:30).</dr class='alt5'></p>  
<p>
He says again, <dr class='alt5'>He who has seen Me has seen the Father; (John. 14:9). </dr class='alt5'><p>

And, have you ever noticed that in the baptismal formula Jesus uses is “bad” grammar? <br>He says,<dr class='alt5'> baptising them in the name</dr class='alt5'> (not names as it grammatically “should” be) <dr class='alt5'>of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,(Matt 28:19).<dr class='alt5'> <p>God is One (name) and God is three (Father, Son and Holy Spirit).
</li></ol></p>
<p>
Thus Scripture exhibits the teaching of the Trinity, going back even to the beginning
</p>
<h3>
The Teaching of the Trinity Experienced 
</h3>
<p>
We who are made in the image and likeness of God ought to experience something of the mystery of the Trinity within us. And sure enough we do.

For, it is clear that we are all distinct individuals. I am not you, you are not me. Yet it is also true that we are made for communion. Humanly we cannot exist apart from one another. Obviously we depend on our parents through whom God made us. But even beyond physical descent, we need one another for completion.<p>
Despite what old songs say, no man is a rock or an island. There is no self-made man. Even the private business owner needs customers, suppliers and shippers, and other middle men. He uses roads he did not build, has electricity supplied to him over lines he did not string, and speaks a language to his customers and others he did not create. Further, whatever the product he makes, he is likely the heir of technologies and processes he did not invent, others before him did. And the list could go on.
<p>
We are individual, but we are social. We are one, but linked to many. Clearly we do not possess the kind of unity God does, but the three oneness of God echoes in us. We are one, yet we are many.
</p><p>
We have entered into perilous times where our interdependence and communal influence are under-appreciated. That attitude that prevails today is a rather extreme individualism wherein “I can do as I please.” There is a reduced sense at how our individual choices affect the whole of the community, Church or nation. That I am an individual is true, but it is also true that I live in communion with others and must respect that dimension of who I am. I exist not only for me, but for others. And what I do affects others, for good or ill.
</p>
<p>
The “It’s none of my business, what others do” attitude also needs some attention. Privacy and discretion have important places in our life, but so does having concern for what others do and think, the choices they are making and the effects that such things have on others. A common moral and religious vision is an important thing to cultivate. It is ultimately important what others think and do, and we should care about fundamental things like respect for life, love, care for the poor, education, marriage and family. Indeed, marriage an family are fundamental to community, nation and the Church. I am one, but I am also in communion with others and they with me.
</p>
<h3>
Conclusion 
</h3>
<p>
Finally there is a rather remarkable conclusion that some have drawn, that the best image of God in us is not a man alone, or a woman alone, but, rather, a man and a woman together in lasting a fruitful relationship we call marriage. For, when God said,<dr class='alt5'> “Let us make man in our image” (Genesis 1:26)</dr class='alt5'> the text goes on to say,<dr class='alt5'> “Male and female he created them” (Genesis 1:27).</dr class='alt5'> And God says to them,<dr class='alt5'> “Be fruitful and multiply” (Gen 1:28).</dr class='alt5'> So the image of God (as God sets it forth most perfectly) is the married and fruitful couple.
</p><p>
Here of course we must be careful to understand that what we manifest sexually, God manifests spiritually. For God is not male or female in His essence. Thus, we may say, The First Person loves the Second Person, and the Second Person loves the First Person. And so real is that love that it bears fruit in the Third Person. In this way the married couple images God, for the husband loves his wife and the wife loves her husband, and their love bears fruit in their children.
</p>
<p class='block'><dr class='alt'>
So, today as we extol the great mystery of the Trinity, we look not merely outward and upward to understand but also inward to discover that mystery at work in us who are made in the image and likeness of God.</p>
