The Creator
</h1>
<p>
If the biblical teaching on creation is removed or watered down, the faith will not be the same. The doctrine clearly reveals that God is the sovereign over all His creation; remove the doctrine and He is not sovereign, we are not accountable to Him, and in fact, there is no basis for ethics and morality. The Bible teaches that God is the primary cause of all things. Out of His will, and by His decree, He brought everything into existence. One may quibble over the means used in all the points, but the fundamental point, the non-negotiable teaching of the Bible is that He is the Maker of everything. And He did this by decree, by His powerful word (Gen. 1; Ps. 33; Isa. 44, 45; John 1; Romans 1; Colossians 1). There is no room for natural development apart from God’s superintendence in the Christian view of origins. At the risk of simplifying this too much, several observations are in order:
<ol>
<li>The Bible affirms that God existed before anything else; and that He is the creator of everything that exists.
</li>
<li>
The Bible affirms that God created everything that exists by decree; He called everything into existence. This does not say anything about intermediate means; it does say that God is the source of everything.
</li>
<li>
The Bible affirms that God created everything after its kind (Gen. 1). This rules out the idea that from one form evolved all the species.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
So regardless of the debates of the age of the earth, fossils, natural selection or beneficial mutations, there are some straightforward declarations in the Bible that clearly teach that God is the creator of everything, and that as a result He is the one who has control over the world He created.<br> He is called “Almighty” because He must be almighty to do the things that He has done, notably create and sustain everything! All power belongs to Him; He is the sovereign Lord of the universe He has made.</p> <p>(Perhaps this is the real issue! Perhaps people would accept the biblical doctrine of creation more readily if it did not mean that He is the almighty God who will hold them accountable for what they do.) But a god who cannot create, is not a sovereign god; it is a god who does not have to be listened to. However, to acknowledge God as the creator is to accept Him as the sovereign Lord, all-knowing, all-powerful, and ever present everywhere. </p>
