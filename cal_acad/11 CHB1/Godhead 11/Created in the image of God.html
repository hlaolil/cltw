<h1> Created in the image of God</h1>
<h2>  Genesis 1:27 </h2>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>So God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them.</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
<h3>So God created man in His own image: </h3>
<p>
God created man according to His plan as described in Genesis 1:26. The concept of man being created in the image of God is repeated to give emphasis to the idea.</p>
<p>
We are plainly told God created man fully formed, and created him in one day, not gradually over millions of years of progressive evolution. The idea that a slow, progressive evolution could produce a complex mechanism like the human body just doesn’t hold up.</p>
<p>
It is said there would be at least 40 different stages of evolution required to form an eye. What possible benefit could there be for the first 39 stages? The mathematician D.S. Ulam argues it was highly improbable for the eye to evolve by the accumulation of small mutations, because the number of mutations must be so large and the time available was not nearly long enough for them to appear. </p>
<p>
Evolutionist Ernst Mayr commented: “Somehow or other by adjusting these figures we will come out all right. We are comforted by the fact that evolution has occurred.” Johnson observes: “Darwinism to them was not a theory open to refutation but a fact to be accounted for.” (Johnson) </p>
<p>
Darwin wrote: “If it could be demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have been formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely break down.”</p>
<p>
Professor Richard Goldschmidt, a geneticist at the University of California at Berkley, listed a series of complex structures (from the hair of mammals to haemoglobin) he thought could not have been produced by thousands of years of small mutations. “The Darwinists met this fantastic suggestion with savage ridicule. As Goldschmidt put it, "This time I was not only crazy but almost a criminal."</p>
<p>"… To suppose that such a random event could reconstruct even a single complex organ like a liver or kidney is about as reasonable as to suppose that an improved watch can be designed by throwing an old one against the wall." (Johnson) </p>
<p>
<h3>Male and female He created them</h3>
<p>
This should not be construed to mean Adam was originally some type of androgynous being, being both male and female. This passage of Genesis gives us an overview of God’s creation of man, and Genesis 2 will explain how exactly God created male and female.</p>
<p>
In our day, many say there is no real difference between men and women. This makes sense if we are the result of mindless evolution, but is it not true that,<dr class='alt5'><it> male and female,</dr class='alt5'> He created them.</p>
<p>
To God, the differences between men and women are not accidents. Since He created them, the differences are good and meaningful.
Men are not women, and women are not men. One of the saddest signs of our culture’s depravity is the amount and the degree of gender confusion today.</p>
</p>
<p>
It is vain to wonder if men or women are superior to the other. A man is absolutely superior at being a man. A woman is absolutely superior at being a woman. But when a man tries to be a woman or a woman tries to be a man, you have something inferior. </p>
