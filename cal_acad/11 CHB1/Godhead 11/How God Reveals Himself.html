<h1>How God Reveals Himself</h1>
<p>
Imagine, for a moment, that you are God. You created all 

things – including human beings. You made humans in Your 

own image (Genesis 1:26-27) and you want them to relate to 

You in a special way.</p>
<p>
Wouldn't you tell those humans about Yourself? Wouldn't 

you tell them what You expect of them? Wouldn't You tell 

them how to come into the relationship You want to share 

with them?</p>
<p>
People who believe that God is unknowable assume that 

God, for some reason, hides Himself from His creation. But 

God does reveal Himself, through His creation, in history, in 

the pages of the Bible, and through His Son, Jesus Christ. 

Let's look at what God shows us about Himself through His 

acts of self-revelation.</p>
<h2>Creation reveals God</h2>
<p>
Many people have looked at the grand cosmos and 

concluded from it that God exists, that God holds all power 

and that God works in order and harmony. Romans 

tells us, <dr class='alt5'>" For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse." (Romans 1:20)</dr class='alt5'> </p>
<p>
Looking at God's fabulous heavens made King David marvel 

that God even notices humans, who seem so insignificant 

next to God: <dr class='alt5'>"When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers,
The moon and the stars, which You have ordained, what is man that You are mindful of him, and the son of man that You visit him?" (Psalm 8:3-4).</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
The patriarch Job questioned God. In reply, God described 

many of His marvels – and thus revealed His limitless 

authority and wisdom. Job was humbled by the exchange. 

You can read God's "speech" in chapters 38-41 of the book 

of Job.</p>
<p>
Job realised: <dr class='alt5'>"I know that You can do everything, and that no purpose of Yours can be withheld from You ... Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know ... I have heard of You by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees You." (Job 42:2-3, 5).</dr class='alt5'></p>
<h2>God's purpose for humanity</h2>
<p>
God did this <dr class='alt5'>"so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him," (Acts 17:27)</dr class='alt5'>.
<br>What did God intend when He made all things and gave us 
life? Paul explained to the Athenians:<dr class='alt5'> "And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined their pre appointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings, so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us; for in Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, ‘For we are also His offspring" (Acts 17:26-28).</dr class='alt5'>
<br>Or, simply, as John wrote,<dr class='alt5'> "We love Him because He first loved us"(1John 4:19)</dr class='alt5'>.</p>
<h2>History reveals God</h2>
<p>
Sceptics ask, "If God is real, why doesn't He show himself to 

the world?" This question assumes that God hasn't already 

shown Himself to humanity.</p>
<p>
However, the Bible record reveals no basis for this 

assumption. For, in fact, from the time of the first family on, 

God has often placed Himself in direct communication with 

human beings. But they, for the most part, have wanted 

nothing to do with God!</p>
<p>
The story of Adam and Eve describes humanity's typical 

reaction. God had created these people and spoke directly 

to them. But they disobeyed Him, and then hid themselves 

from Him. <dr class='alt5'>"And they heard the sound of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God among the trees of the garden." (Genesis 3:8)</dr class='alt5'>.</p>
