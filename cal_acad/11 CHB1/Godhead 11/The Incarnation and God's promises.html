   <h1>The Incarnation and God's promises</h1>
<p>
First, then, the promise that Jesus would receive the throne of David. In its original form, that promise was that David's seed would sit on his throne forever (2 Sam 7:16). That promise had a first, typical, earthly, OT fulfilment in Solomon and those who followed him on the throne of the Kingdom of Judah. God fulfilled it by preserving the line and throne of David through many perils - an on-going fulfilment of the promise.</p>
<p>
That fulfilment, however, was only typical and incomplete. As became evident in Judah's history, David's descendants did not retain the throne, nor preserve the glory of it. By the time Christ came,the Incarnation, the line of David had dwindled to one woman (Luke 1:32-34), so that there was no man left to sit on David's throne, which throne had been usurped by others. Herod sat in Caesar's name where once David and his sons had ruled.</p>
<p>
Therefore, Christ was the principle fulfilment of the promise concerning David's throne, but He received not an earthly typical throne, but the heavenly and everlasting throne of which that earthly throne was but a shadow. <br>(Psa 24:7-10; Acts 2:30; Heb 1:8).</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, even the fulfilment of that promise in Christ has various stages and an on-going fulfilment. That the throne belonged to Christ already at birth, His Incarnation,  as is evident from the worship of the Wise men (Matt. 2:2, 11). This does not only mean that He would be a great King, but already then He was directing and controlling the events of history and acting as a great King though He lay (humanly speaking) a helpless baby in Bethlehem.</p>
<p>
That He had the throne was evident throughout His ministry in all His acts of power and in every display of His majesty. He acted as King on the mountain with Satan (Matt. 4:8-10), in all His miracles, and in His triumph over His enemies in the garden (John. 18:4-9). He, not they, controlled the course of events.</p>
<p>
That promise had a fulfilment at the cross when they (in mockery, no doubt) hung the words of truth over His head, "This is the King of the Jews." There He, the King of kings, triumphed gloriously over all enemies. It had a further fulfilment in His ascension and exaltation to God's right hand (Acts 2:30), and will not be completely fulfilled until finally He sits in that throne judging all creatures and delivering up the Kingdom to His Father.</p>
<p>
All this is true also of the land promise. There was an earthly and typical fulfilment of that promise to Abraham's descendants (a complete fulfilment, we might note, so that there is nothing left to be fulfilled of that promise as far as the earthly land is concerned - I Kings 8:56). God continued to fulfil that promise typically when He preserved the nation in the land and after the captivity brought them back to it.</p>
<p>
Nevertheless, as Abraham himself saw (Acts 7:5; Heb. 11:8-16), the earthly land was not the real or final fulfilment of the promise. That promise ultimately concerned the new heavens and earth and Abraham's spiritual descendants, and will not be fulfilled completely until the elect take possession of the new heavens and earth when Christ returns. 
<p class='blockin'><dr class='alt1'>There is, then, an on-going and growing fulfilment of all God's promises!</p>
