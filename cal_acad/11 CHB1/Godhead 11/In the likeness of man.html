   <h1>In the likeness of man</h1>
<p>
Christ took upon Him the form of sinful man, clothing His divinity with humanity. But He was holy, even as God is holy. He was the sin-bearer, needing no atonement. Had He not been without spot or stain of sin, He could not have been the Saviour of mankind. One with God in purity and holiness, He was able to make a propitiation for the sins of the world.</p>
<h3>
 The Saviour took the form of sinful man
</h3>
<p>
The expression that "Christ took upon Him the form of sinful man" must not be construed to mean that Jesus came into the world tainted with sin. He had the form and fashion of a man, but, as we have already learned, and as the quoted lines themselves clearly affirm, He was without a stain of sin.</p>
<p>
Likewise, Paul's expression <dr class='alt5'>"God sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh" (Rom. 8:3)</dr class='alt5'> must not be interpreted to mean that God sent His Son in sinful flesh. A likeness is a resemblance, a similarity, a similitude, a semblance, a form, an external appearance and not something absolutely the same as another thing. A photograph of a person, for instance, is a likeness of the outward appearance of the person who sat for it, but it is not otherwise a likeness of that person. So with the flesh of Christ. It resembled the flesh of the men around Him, but it was free from the taint of sin.</p>
<p>
If Jesus had come into the world tainted and polluted with sin He could not have chosen to return to His Father without dying. The fact that He could have gone back to His Father without dying is evidence that He was pure and holy. This fact is clearly stated in the following reference to Christ in Gethsemane.
</p>
<h3>
Christ in Gethsemane
</h3>
<p>
The fate of humanity trembled in the balance. Christ might even now refuse to drink the cup apportioned to guilty man. It was not yet too late. He might wipe the bloody sweat from His brow, and leave man to perish in his iniquity. He might say, Let the transgressor receive the penalty of his sin, and I will go back to My Father.
This quotation reveals not only the fact that Christ had no inborn sin or pollution for which He had to die but also the fact that Jesus did not have to die for lost humanity. He could have chosen to return to His Father without dying, and to leave the doomed sinners to perish in their sins. But, thank God, He did not choose to do so. Because of His undying love for His wayward children, He chose to assume the guilt of their sins, and to die on the cruel cross in their stead. He could not save Himself if He wanted to save others. Therefore He gave His own life in order that others might live. It was His own choice. He offered Himself, in order that you and I might live.
</p>
<h3>
Temptation
</h3>
<p>
Occasionally, when it is pointed out that Jesus came into this world without any propensity to sin, someone will ask, "How then could He be tempted?" The answer is simple: He was tempted the same as Adam was tempted. Adam was created pure and holy, without any inclination to sin, yet he could be tempted. He was tempted; and he fell. Jesus likewise could be tempted. So fierce was the temptation that He<dr class='alt5'>"resisted to bloodshed" (see Hebrews 12:3,4)</dr class='alt5'>. But He did not fall. Therein lies our hope for eternal life.</p>
<p>
Adam in Eden had a human nature, which from the first moment of his existence was capable of sin. But Adam in Eden was spotless until that day that he exercised his will in the wrong way and drew sin into his bosom.</p>
<p>
Our father Adam lost the battle with the tempter, not because he had a "desperately wicked" heart—he came from the Creator's hand perfect—but because he wrongly exercised his free will and drew wickedness into his heart. And we, his children, have followed in his steps. Christ, the "last Adam," won the battle with the tempter, and we, through His promised forgiveness and power, may also win. Adam could have won, but he lost. Christ could have lost, but He won. Therein lies the startling contrast ...</p>
<p>
Christ won despite the fact that He took on Him "the likeness of sinful flesh," with all that that implies of the baleful and weakening effects of sin on the body and nervous system of man and its evil effects on his environment—"can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?"
</p>
<h3>
Christ knew no sin
</h3>
<p>
We must do the greater honour to Christ, without charging Him with any taint of sin, by believing that though He could have exercised His free will to sin, He did not; that although He felt the full force of temptation, even as we must, He set His will on the side of His Father instead of yielding it to the devil. Temptation assailed Him but found no response in His heart.<p> He said,<dr class='alt5'> "I will no longer talk much with you, for the ruler of this world is coming, and he has nothing in Me"  (John 14:30).</dr class='alt5'> <br>He<dr class='alt5'> "loved righteousness and hated lawlessness" (Heb. 1:9)</dr class='alt5'> In that sense was He most truly <dr class='alt5'> "separate from sinners." (Heb. 7:26)</dr class='alt5'>  Unreservedly we accept the words of Holy Writ that Christ <dr class='alt5'>"knew no sin." (2 Cor. 5:21)</dr class='alt5'></p>
