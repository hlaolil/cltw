 	<h1>The Divine Three</h1>
<p>
The Scriptures teach that there is a personal distinction between those individuals identified in the New Testament as the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and these persons are in some sense three.
Study very carefully the following passages in which the persons of the divine Godhead are distinguished:<br> Matt 3:16-17; 28:19; Luke 1:35; John 14:26; 15:26; 2 Cor 13:14; <br>Eph 2:18; 4:4-6; 1 Peter 1:2; Jude 20-21; Rev 1:4-5.</p>
<p>
It is obvious that these inspired verses reveal three separate persons.
Furthermore, additional biblical data reveal that each of these three persons is God—i.e., each possesses the quality or nature of deity.<p><dr class='alt3'> The Father is deity (Eph 1:3),</dr class='alt3'><br><dr class='alt3'> The Son is deity  (Heb 1:8),</dr class='alt3'> <br><dr class='alt3'> The Holy Spirit is deity  (Acts 5:3-4).</dr class='alt3'></p>
<p>
Any elementary student of logic knows perfectly well that the Godhead cannot be both one and three without a logical contradiction being involved—if the adjectives “one” and “three” are employed in the identical sense.
But the fact of the matter is, they are not used in the same sense. There is but one divine nature, but there are three distinct personalities possessing that unified set of infinite qualities. Thus, there is no contradiction at all.
Without a recognition of the above principle, some Bible passages would be difficult to harmonise.</p>
<p>
For example, in Isaiah 44 YHWH affirms that <dr class='alt5'>“I am the Lord, who makes all things, Who stretches out the heavens all alone, Who spreads abroad the earth by Myself; (Isa 44:24) </dr class='alt5'>
So, God was alone.<br>
Yet in John 8 Christ said, <dr class='alt5'>“And He who sent Me is with Me. The Father has not left Me alone,” (John 8:29)</dr class='alt5'> And so, Jesus was not alone, for the Father was with Him; correspondingly, the Father was not alone.<br>
The question is: how can God be both alone and not alone?</p>
<p>
In Isaiah’s passage, God (the One divine nature) was being contrasted with the false gods of paganism; the personalities of the Godhead were not a consideration there. In John 8:29, the relationship of two divine personalities (Father and Son) was in view. Different subjects, but no discrepancy.<br>
Similarly, when a certain scribe affirmed that <dr class='alt5'>“there is one God, and there is no other but He.” (Mark 12:32),</dr class='alt5'> he was correct. He was declaring monotheism, as suggested above.</p>
<p>
In another setting though, Christ, revealing a distinction between Himself and the Father, said: <dr class='alt5'>“There is another who bears witness of Me, and I know that the witness which He witnesses of Me is true.” (John 5:32).</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
<h3>Old Testament Evidence of Divine Plurality</h3>
<p>
The biblical doctrine of the Godhead is progressive. By that we mean that the concept unfolds, being gradually illuminated from the Old Testament to the New Testament. Nevertheless, the multiple personalities of the holy Godhead clearly are distinguished in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>“In the beginning God [Elohim — plural] created [Bara — singular]” (Gen 1:1)</dr class='alt5'> <br> In the plural form Elohim, many scholars see a “foreshadowing of the plurality of persons in the Divine Trinity” [Smith 1959, 11]. Adam Clarke declared that the term “has long been supposed, by the most eminently learned and pious men, to imply a plurality of Persons in the Divine nature” (n.d., 28). Richard Watson wrote that Elohim “seems to be the general appellation by which the Triune Godhead is collectively distinguished in Scripture” (1881, 1024).</p>
<p>
<p class='crb'>
Though some scholars call this plural form a “plural of majesty” (i.e., a suggestion of multiple majestic traits), Nathan Stone observed that the plural of majesty “was not known then” (1944, 12). Professor Harold Stigers noted:
“A multiplicity of personalities in the Godhead, implied in the creative process in the use of the titles ‘God’ (1:1) and ‘Spirit of God' (1:2), is involved in the creative and redemptive work of God” (1976, 47).</p>
<h4>
Multiple divine personalities
</h4>
<p>
Multiple divine personalities are alluded to in such passages as follows:<p>
<dr class='alt5'>“And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness” (Gen 1:2) </dr class='alt5'> <p>(Note: this cannot refer to angels, as is often claimed, for angels are themselves created (Neh 9:6; Psa 148:2,5), not creators; and the context limits the creating to God [Gen 1:27].)<p>
<dr class='alt5'>“Behold, the man has become like one of Us, to know good and evil.” <br>(Gen 3:22)</dr class='alt5'><p>
<dr class='alt5'>“Come, let Us go down and there confuse their language,” (Gen 11:7)</dr class='alt5'><br>(Incidentally, “come” in the Hebrew text is plural, so that the divine spokesman must be addressing and acting in union with at least two others [Thiessen 1949, 126].)<p>
<dr class='alt5'>“Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: “Whom shall I send, And who will go for Us?” (Isa 6:8)</dr class='alt5'><p>
<dr class='alt5'>“Remember now your Creator[Hebrew plural]  in the days of your youth,” <br>(Eccl 12:1)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<h4>
Distinction of personalities 
</h4>
<p>
Numerous other passages reveal a distinction of personalities within the Godhead:<br>
In Genesis 18, the Lord, temporarily assuming the form of a man, visits Sodom.<br> Surveying the evil of that area, this Lord then <dr class='alt5'>“ rained brimstone and fire on Sodom and Gomorrah, from the Lord out of the heavens.” (Gen 19:24)</dr class='alt5'><br> Two persons are clearly denominated “Lord.”<p>
<dr class='alt5'>“Thus says the Lord, the King of Israel, And his Redeemer, the Lord of hosts:
‘I am the First and I am the Last; Besides Me there is no God.” (Isa 44:6)</dr class='alt5'><br> (Note: the language of this verse is applied to Christ in Rev 1:17.)<p>
Christ prophetically says: <dr class='alt5'>“Then I said to them, “If it is agreeable to you, give me my wages; and if not, refrain.” So they weighed out for my wages thirty pieces of silver. And the Lord said to me ...” (Zech 11:12-13)</dr class='alt5'><p>
<dr class='alt5'>“The Lord said to my Lord, “Sit at My right hand,” (Psa 110:1)<dr class='alt5'><p>
<dr class='alt5'>“And the Lord has laid on Him the iniquity of us all” (Isa 53:6)</dr class='alt5'><p>
<dr class='alt5'>“The kings of the earth set themselves, And the rulers take counsel together, Against the Lord and against His Anointed, saying,
“Let us break Their bonds in pieces And cast away Their cords from us.” (Psa 2:2-3)<dr class='alt5'><p>
This is but a fractional sampling of a vast amount of Old Testament evidence for the plural personalities of deity.</p>
<p>
<h3>New Testament Evidence of Divine Plurality</h3>
<p>
There are many obvious indications of distinction between the Father, the Son, and the Spirit in the New Testament.</p>
<p>
For instance, there is the clear case of the baptismal scene of Christ,<dr class='alt5'><br> When He had been baptised, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting upon Him. And suddenly a voice came from heaven ... (Matt 3:16-17).<dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
Then there is Matthew’s record of the “great commission” where baptism is <dr class='alt5'><br>“in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,” (Matt 28:19)</dr class='alt5'><p>
The term “name” stands for becoming the possession of, and under the protection of, the one into whose name an individual is immersed, and its singular form here likely stresses the unity of the holy Three.
The multiple use of the article “the” before the words Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, however, according to a well-known rule of Greek grammar, plainly demonstrates that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are separate persons, and not merely three manifestations of one person.</p>
<h4>
Distinction between divine persons
</h4>
<p>
There are other New Testament evidences revealing a distinction between the divine persons of the holy Godhead:
Christ is said to be a<dr class='alt5'> Mediator between God and men (1 Tim 2:5).</dr class='alt5'> The word “mediator” is used of “one who mediates between two parties to remove a disagreement or reach a common goal. Of Christ with the genitive of persons between whom He mediates”.
Clearly, Christ cannot be a mediator between God and man if He is the totality of the holy Godhead.</p>
<p>
In John 8:16-17, the Lord cited the Old Testament principle of multiple witnesses for legal documentation. He is countering the Pharisaic allegation that His witness is not true (John 8:13). He reasons, therefore, that just as the law requires at least two witnesses to establish credibility, so the Lord is “not alone”; He bears witness of Himself, and the Father bears witness of Him.
If Jesus is the same person as the Father, His argument makes no sense!</p>
<p>
Christ once taught: <dr class='alt5'>“I am the true vine, and My Father is the vine dresser.”<br> (John 15:1)</dr class='alt5'><br> In the same allegory He identified the disciples as “branches.” The narrative thus has three principal features: husband man (the Father), vine (the Son), and branches (disciples).
It is not difficult to see that there is as much distinction between the vine dresser and the vine as there is between the vine and the branches.</p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>“But of that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.” (Mark 13:32)</dr class='alt5'><br> While Jesus was upon the earth, He knew not the time of the judgement day. The Father, however, did know! Thus, clearly the Father and the Son were not the same person.</p>
<p>
Similarly, <dr class='alt5'>“Anyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him”<br> (Matt 12:32)</dr class='alt5'><br>
The contrast here between the Son and the Holy Spirit plainly shows that they are not identical in personality. These two arguments make it certain that Christ was neither the Father nor the Spirit.</p>
<p>
In speaking of Christ’s subordination to God, Paul says: <dr class='alt5'>“... the head of Christ is God” (1 Cor 11:3)</dr class='alt5'> 
Would it make any sense to speak of One being head of Himself?</p>
<p>
Jesus is said to be <dr class='alt5'>the very image</dr class='alt5'> of the Father. 
In the New Testament it is used metaphorically in Heb 1, of the Son of God as <dr class='alt5'>"the express image of His person" <br> (Heb 1:3),</dr class='alt5'> The phrase expresses the fact that the Son is both personally distinct from, and yet literally equal to Him of whose essence He is the adequate imprint.</p>
<h4>
Contrasts
</h4>
<p>
The following passages contain contrasts which reveal a distinction between the Father and the Son:
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>Christ did not seek His own will, but the will of His Father (John 5:30)
</dr class='alt5'> </p> 
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>  “My doctrine is not Mine, but His who sent Me. (John 7:16).</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'> I have not come of Myself, but He who sent Me (John 7:28; 8:42).</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>It is My Father who honours Me (John 8:54).</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>For the Father judges no one, but has committed all judgement to the Son, (John 5:22).</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His form.<>(John 5:37; cf. 1:18).</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
 But they had both seen and heard Christ. Hence, He was not the same person as the Father.</p>
<h4>
Distinction
</h4>
<p>
There are many grammatical forms which show the distinction between the persons of the Godhead. In addition to plural pronouns (e.g., “our,” “we,” “us” [John 14:23; 17:11, 21]), prepositions frequently function in this capacity.<p> 
<dr class='alt5'>the Spirit of truth who proceeds from the Father, (John 15:26)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
In the beginning Christ was with God <dr class='alt5'>... and the Word was with God (John 1:1)</dr class='alt5'>.</p>
<p> 
<dr class='alt5'>I speak what I have seen with My Father,(John 8:38)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'> ... that I came forth from God(John 16:27)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'> yet for us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we for Him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and through whom we live. (1 Cor 8:6).</dr class='alt5'> <dr class='alt5'> For through Him we both have access by one Spirit to the Father. (Eph 2:18)</dr class='alt5'>.</p>
<p>
Conjunctions can also indicate a distinction.</p> 
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>He who abides in the doctrine of Christ has both the Father and the Son. <br> (2 John 9)</dr class='alt5'>.
<p>
Jesus rebuked the Jews: <dr class='alt5'>“You know neither Me nor My Father. If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also.” (John 8:19)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<h4>
Comparisons
</h4>
<p>Comparative terms reveal distinction.</p>
<p>
Though Christ did not hold onto His equality with God <dr class='alt5'> who, being in the form of God, (Phil 2:6)</dr class='alt5'>—in terms of the independent exercise of divine privileges—</p>
<p>
nonetheless,  <dr class='alt5'>God was His Father, making Himself equal with God (John 5:18). </dr class='alt5'> </p>
<p>
In Christ’s subordinate position, though,<dr class='alt5'> My Father is greater than I.<br>(John 14:28)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<h4>
Separate
</h4>
<p>
Many verbal forms indicate that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are separate in personality.</p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'> "for I am from Him, and He sent Me.” (John 7:29)</dr class='alt5'></p> 
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>and when the Helper comes, whom I shall send to you (John 15:26)</dr class='alt5'> </p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>The Father loves the Son (John 3:35)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'> the Father who dwells in Me (John 14:10)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'> He gave His only begotten Son(John 3:16)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'> highly exalted Him (Philippians 2:9)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'> All things have been delivered to Me by My Father (Matthew 11:27)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'> “Father, into Your hands I commit My spirit."(Luke 23:46)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>I am ascending to My Father (John 20:17).</p>

<p class='crb'>The Bible contains many such expressions which are meaningless if the Father, Son, and Spirit are the same person.</p>
