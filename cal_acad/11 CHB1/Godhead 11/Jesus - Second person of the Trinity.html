   <h1>
 Jesus - Second person of the Trinity
</h1>
<p>
A startling passage is Proverbs 30:4. The prophet Agur is speaking about the nature of Almighty God, confessing his ignorance of Him.<dr class='alt5'> "Who has ascended to heaven and come down? Who has gathered the wind in His fists? Who has wrapped up the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth?"</dr class='alt5'> Then comes, <dr class='alt5'>"What is His name, and what is His son's name? Surely you know!"</dr class='alt5'> In that day the prophet knew only the Father's name, the name Jehovah. Today we know that His Son's name is the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<h3>
The Divinity of Jesus
</h3>
<p>
The Lord Jesus Christ is fully divine, being the second person of the Godhead who became man. This, of course, is where the crux of debate on the Trinity is to be found; those who dislike the doctrine dislike it primarily because they are unwilling to give such an exalted position to "the man" Jesus.</p>
<p>
The deity of the Lord Jesus Christ is taught in many crucial passages. We read <dr class='alt5'>"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God" (John. 1:1-2).</dr class='alt5'> <br>That John 1:1-2 speaks of the Lord Jesus Christ is clear when we are told that the <dr class='alt5'>"Word"</dr class='alt5'> of verse 1 <dr class='alt5'>"became flesh and dwelt among us." (John 1:14)</dr class='alt5'> </p>
<p>Similarly, Paul writes, <dr class='alt5'>" Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bond servant, and coming in the likeness of men. And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross." (Phil. 2:5-8).</dr class='alt5'><br
> The words <dr class='alt5'>" did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bond servant"</dr class='alt5'> do not mean that Jesus ceased to be fully God in the Incarnation, as some have maintained, but only that He temporarily laid aside His divine glory and dignity in order to live among us.</p>
<p> 
We remember that it was during the days of His life here that Jesus said, <dr class='alt5'>"I and the Father are one" (John. 10:30),</dr class='alt5'> and <dr class='alt5'>"He who has seen me has seen the Father" (John. 14:9).</dr class='alt5'>
