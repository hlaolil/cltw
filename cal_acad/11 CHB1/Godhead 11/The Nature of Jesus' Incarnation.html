   <h1>The Nature of Jesus' Incarnation</h1>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God (John 1:1)</dr class='alt5'>—the mighty God, the Creator<dr class='alt5'> upholding all things by the word of His power (Heb 1:3)</dr class='alt5'>—<dr class='alt5'>" became flesh and dwelt among us!" (John 1:14)</dr class='alt5'> Because of His unfathomable love for lost mankind, He left His throne, came down to earth, clothed His divinity with humanity, lived with us as one with us, and died in our stead, <dr class='alt5'>I have come that they may have life (John 10:10).</dr class='alt5'></p>
<h2>
The Son of God's Humility
</h2>
<p>
Speaking of this wonderful voluntary humiliation of the Son of God, the apostle Paul says, <dr class='alt5'><br>"Let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus, who, being in the form of God, did not consider it robbery to be equal with God, but made Himself of no reputation, taking the form of a bond servant, and coming in the likeness of men. And being found in appearance as a man, He humbled Himself and became obedient to the point of death, even the death of the cross." (Phil. 2:5-8)<dr class='alt5'>.</p>
<p>
What humility was this! It amazed angels. The tongue can never describe it; the imagination cannot take it in. The eternal Word consented to be made flesh! God became man! It was a wonderful humility.</p>
<p>
The voluntary humiliation of Christ went farther than to take human nature.
It would have been an almost infinite humiliation for the Son of God to take man's nature, even when Adam stood in his innocence in Eden. But Jesus accepted humanity when the race had been weakened by four thousand years of sin. Like every child of Adam He accepted the results of the working of the great law of heredity.
</p>
<h2>
The effect of sin on the human race
</h2>
<p>
Our attention is called to the sad fact that sin has had a deteriorating effect on the human race. When Adam was created he was lofty of stature, with corresponding strength and vitality. 
Such was not the size, strength, and perfection of the human race when Jesus was born into the world. Four thousand years of reckless violation of the divine laws of nature had greatly reduced the size and impaired the strength and perfection of the human body. Nerves and muscles had been weakened through centuries of indulgence. By permitting the law of heredity to operate in His incarnation, Jesus inherited, from the side of His mother, a body comparable in size to that of the bodies of the men of His day, and was subject to the infirmities and weaknesses of other men. Thus, speaking prophetically of Jesus when He was here on earth, Isaiah declares that He was <dr class='alt5'>"He is despised and rejected by men, A Man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. And we hid, as it were, our faces from Him; He was despised, and we did not esteem Him." (Isa. 53:3, 4).</dr class='alt5'> Referring to this declaration, Matthew says of Jesus: <dr class='alt5'>"that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying: “He Himself took our infirmities and bore our sicknesses." (Matt. 8:17).</dr class='alt5'> Thus in this sense the second Adam was not physically identical with the first Adam. It was also in this sense of depreciation in size and vitality that Christ by the law of heredity is said to have taken upon Himself our "fallen nature".</p>
<h2>Christ Sinless</h2>
<p>
Because Christ clothed His divinity with humanity and bore the physical infirmities and weaknesses of mankind, some are inclined to believe that He came into the world with the propensities of sin, like all the sons and daughters of Adam. This, we believe, is contrary to the information given us in the Bible.
</p>
<p class='block'><dr class='alt'>
Be careful, exceedingly careful, as to how you dwell upon the human nature of Christ.<br> Do not set Him before the people as a man with the propensities of sin. He is the second Adam.<br> The first Adam was created a pure, sinless being, without a taint of sin upon Him; he was in the image of God. He could fall, and he did fall through transgressing. Because of sin his posterity was born with inherent propensities of disobedience.<br> But Jesus Christ was the only begotten Son of God. He took upon Himself human nature, and was tempted in all points as human nature is tempted. He could have sinned; He could have fallen, but not for one moment was there in Him an evil propensity. He was assailed with temptations in the wilderness, as Adam was assailed with temptations in Eden.</p>
