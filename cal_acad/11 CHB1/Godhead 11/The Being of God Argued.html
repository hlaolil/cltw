 <h1>The Being of God Argued</h1>
<p>The fundamental doctrine of Theology is that there is a God; for if this is not true, there can be no science of God.</p>
<p>The first duty of Theology, therefore, is to set forth the reasons men have for believing that such a being exists, and is a true object of dependence and worship.</p>
<h4>
God can be Sufficiently Known
</h4>
<p>It is objected, however, to any science of God, that, if there is a God, He cannot be so known and comprehended as to be a true object of worship.</p>
<p>
If by this is meant that we cannot know the essential nature of God, it proceeds upon a principle upon which we can know nothing, for we do not know the essential nature of anything. We know not even the nature of our own essence. We cannot know that of any existent being or substance, not indeed of the smallest atom of matter. We can only judge what it must be from the qualities it is perceived to possess, or from its outward manifestations. In like manner we can discover something of the nature of God from the different ways in which He has manifested Himself in ourselves and in the universe.</p>
<p> If it is claimed that we cannot know Him because His nature may be or must be wholly different from ours, the natural answer is that we do know many things which differ greatly from the mind which takes cognisance of them. Thus our own bodies, though purely material, are known through our mental faculties, and yet we believe mind and matter to be essentially diverse. We comprehend also our modes of existence, and those of other objects in time and space, though these modes are essentially different from the thing which exist in them.</p>
<p>
Besides, until we know what God is, we cannot be sure that He is in all respects different from ourselves. If there are any points of similarity, we can know Him so far as these exist; and, if it is true that we have been made, in any respect, in the likeness and image of God, our knowledge of God may approach at least to such completeness as to enable us to recognise His more manifest perfections, and to perceive that because of these He ought to be reverenced and worshipped.</p>
<p>
Guided by the analogy of our own natures we expect to find in Him a personal, conscious, intelligent, and moral being, and this expectation is confirmed by the manifestations of His presence, and operations in the universe. This teaching of analogy is not worthless because it has also led some to believe that God has a material body as has man. Analogy does not furnish proof, but only probability in some instances only possibilities. It does not show what God is, but what He may be. That which it suggests is confirmed or denied by other sources of knowledge. But we are so far taught through its aid that we learn that God must either be a Spirit, such as we are, or that He must have a higher nature to which belong all those attributes of spirit which constitute conscious personality and intelligent purpose.</p>
<p>Does the objection mean that we cannot know God because we cannot come in contact with Him through the senses as we do with our fellow-men, and cannot learn His nature through His conduct and personal action as we do theirs? But it is not only through personal contact with men that we know that they are and what they are; we both know and judge of them by their works, though we have never seen nor known them personally. In like manner through our senses are we brought into contact with God, who though not material, is an artificer in material things, and has displayed before us, in the universe around, the evidences of His wisdom, power and goodness. Surely so great a structure as this, which manifests a grasp of thought, and a power of performance so wonderfully beyond that of any human being, and a minuteness of detail and execution and finish, the limitations of which defy discovery through the most powerful microscope that man can ever make, shows that it has been fashioned, if not created, by some being of personal purposing skill and power immeasurably beyond anything that we can possibly conceive.</p>
<p>Is it asserted that the outward phenomena of the universe cannot give such mental and spiritual knowledge of God as is essential to our apprehension and worship of Him? Even were this true, we get that knowledge through our own spiritual and mental operations. We find in ourselves consciousness of existence, of thought and of purpose, and thus learn not only what these are in other intelligent beings, but that they must exist in every being whose nature is as high as, or higher than, that of man. We perceive that the mind is governed by laws no less binding and effective, no less regular and permanent, than those of matter. In the study of these we learn the nature of mind and spirit, not by direct apprehension of their essence, but, as in matter, by indirectly apprehending them through their phenomena. That nature we ascribe to the Divine Mind and Spirit. The differences of mental and spiritual capacities in men convince us that there are degrees of greater or less in mental and spiritual natures. Hence we assign to God mind and spirit in the highest degree, because as their author He must Himself be greater than all His mental and spiritual creations.</p>
<p>
But, in addition to this, we have a peculiar source of information. We find our minds capable of intuitive knowledge. Some abstract principles need only to be understood, and the conviction that they are true immediately follows. That "the whole is greater than an one of its parts" is perceived as soon as understood, as is likewise that "a thing cannot be, and not be, at the same time." Whence is this knowledge? We say that the mind is so constituted that it cannot believe otherwise. Who has so constituted it? It must proceed from some one upon whose veracity we rely, when we accept what our nature teaches. But, if from any one, then there is a creating mind, and that mind operates directly upon mind without the intervention of matter, and thus teaches us truth. When, then, we find other convictions of like nature relative to our dependent upon a higher being, our obligations of duty to Him, our sense of right, and wrong, and the duty to do the right, and not to do the wrong, we cannot avoid believing that these intuitions come from the same source, and are His instructions to us as to our moral relation and duties to Him.</p>
<h4>
A Further Objection &mdash; God is Absolute, the Infinite, the Unconditioned
</h4>
<p>But it is further objected that, if there is a God we cannot know Him because He must be the Absolute, the Infinite, the Unconditioned, and, therefore, cannot be an object of comprehension to us, whose nature is finite, and whose mode of existence is only relative, finite and conditioned.</p>
<p>But the objection itself presents its own refutation. How do we know that God must be such, if there is a God? In whatever way we know this, we know at least that much of God that He must be the Absolute, the Infinite, the Unconditioned. Even before we are supposed to know that He exists, therefore, we know this much of the nature which must be His, and upon the first evidence of His existence have the right to attribute to Him all that is therein contained. The characteristics thus ascribed to Him, reveal Him, therefore, to us, as an infinite existence, without other limitations than are found in His own nature, or essence, who, as Absolute, cannot be dependent, but must be the source and Sovereign of all else; and, as the Unconditioned, cannot be subject to time, and space, and matter, and must therefore exist without possibility of growth, or increase, and without that succession of periods, such as yesterday, to-day, and to-morrow, and those measures of space, and location, which belong to matter. The God, therefore, who is thus proclaimed to be unknowable is at least known as a self-existent spirit, infinite, eternal and unchangeable in all the perfections that belong to His nature. Let but the least evidence appear that there is a God, and at once this nature may be ascribed to Him.</p>
<p>The recognition and contemplation of such a being, though His other perfections are unknown, awaken the reverence and fear, and conviction of the littleness and dependence of man which enter so largely into the sense of the supernatural and lead men everywhere, when in danger or distress, to call upon God, though not moved to prayer by any promise of answers thereto.</p>
<h4>
Third Objection &mdash; God can only be Known Partially
</h4>
Again, it is objected that though we should learn something of God, we can only attain partial knowledge of Him. This is readily admitted. But partial knowledge is actual knowledge as far as it goes. We have complete knowledge of nothing. All our knowledge is partial. The child only partially knows its parent. The subject only partially knows His sovereign. Yet enough is known for the recognition of dependence, and of the duties of obedience and love. So, also, with the Heavenly Father, the King of Kings; although we can only know Him in part, we know enough to lead us to revere His sovereign power, and gratefully adore His Fatherly affection. The Scripture teaching upon this subject is twofold.</p>
<p>
It agrees with Agnosticism in asserting that God cannot be fully known. The questions of Zophar have been, with full reverence for God, and earnest worship for such a One as it is believed that He must be, the language of the pious of all ages<dr class='alt5'> "Can you search out the deep things of God? Can you find out the limits of the Almighty? They are higher than heaven— what can you do?
Deeper than Sheol (Hell) — what can you know?" Job 11:7-8.</dr class='alt5'><br> Elihu is represented as saying,<dr class='alt5'> "Behold, God is great, and we do not know Him." Job 36:26.</dr class='alt5'><br> And Job, after his description of God's acts of power, declared,<dr class='alt5'> "Indeed these are the mere edges of His ways, and how small a whisper we hear of Him! But the thunder of His power who can understand?” Job 26:14.</dr class='alt5'><br> The Psalmist, referring to the Omniscience and omnipresence of God, cried out,<dr class='alt5'>  "Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; It is high, I cannot attain it."<br> Psa 139:6.</dr class='alt5'> </p>
	<p>
On the other hand, in opposition to Agnostics, the Bible declares that the partial knowledge of God attained by men is actual knowledge and not some inferior conception. God said through Jeremiah, <dr class='alt5'>"Then I will give them a heart to know Me, that I am the Lord;" (Jer. 24:7),</dr class='alt5'> and again<dr class='alt5'> "they all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them" Jer 31:34.</dr class='alt5'> <br>Our Lord himself, in his prayer to the Father, referring to those given to him that to them he should give eternal life declares <dr class='alt5'>"And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent."<br> John 17:3.</dr class='alt5'> <br>The apostle who recorded this prayer uses this language,<dr class='alt5'> "He who knows God hears us" (1 John 4:6),</dr class='alt5'> and also <dr class='alt5'>"He who does not love does not know God, for God is love" 1 John 4:8.</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p class='block'><dr class='alt'>
The Bible, therefore, plainly teaches that God may be known, and so known as to be truly worshipped.</p>
