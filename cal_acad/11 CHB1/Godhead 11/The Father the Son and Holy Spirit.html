 	<h1>The Father the Son and Holy Spirit</h1> 
<p>
This is part of the Christian doctrine usually called the doctrine of the Trinity. This doctrine does not teach three Gods, but only one. They are distinct, but not separate. There is no "family" that people can be born into. We will never be God in the same way that God is God. Rather, we are partakers of the divine nature (2 Peter 1:4) — children of God, but never gods. There can be only one God.</p>
<p>
This is not a matter of confusion, as some say. It is a matter of believing the Bible and realising that God is greater than our finite imaginations can perceive. It is a matter of faith, because we believe the Bible.</p>
<p>
It’s true that the "average" Protestant or Catholic cannot explain God’s nature. Some may even think that there are three God Beings in one Godhead, or a three-headed Being of some sort. But their misunderstandings do not affect the truth of the teaching. The Bible teaching is that there is one God who is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. It is not my idea, nor is it the idea of some fourth-century theologians. It is the teaching of the Bible.</p>
<p>
What the fourth-century theologians did was to formulate a doctrine that denies certain unbiblical teachings about God that were in vogue at the time. One such teaching was the idea that the Son was a created being. Another heresy is the idea that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are not distinct but are really all the same — in other words, the idea that the one God is sometimes the Father, sometimes the Son, and sometimes the Holy Spirit, but not all three all the time. This was declared to be false.</p>

<h2>God is not like a human
</h2>
<p>
God transcends our world of time and space. He created time and space. He appears in it when He desires, but He is in no way limited to time and space. He does not need time and space to exist. We can only think in created terms, in terms of time and space. Therefore, God is everything we can conceive of and more! He uses all sorts of concepts in the Bible to reveal himself to us, and He does it in terms we can understand — like King, Redeemer, Shepherd, Defender, Fire, Rock, Shelter. But He is all those and more, and not just like any of them, because they are all part of the created world.
</p>
<h3>
God's Power
</h3>
<p>
God does not have or need a "mighty arm," for example. God uses the human term, "mighty arm," because it is one we can understand, one that helps us understand something important about the power of God. But it is not a literal description of God. It is a metaphor. God also speaks of His "right hand." Is that because His "right hand" is stronger or more skilled than His "left hand"? Of course not. He is conveying the fact that He is powerful, that He intends to do a particular thing, and that He is going to do it in a powerful way. Bible-believers should not take such descriptions literally and think of God as subject to time and space like ourselves.
</p>
<h3>
Images of God
</h3>
<p>
This brings to mind Paul’s statement in Romans 1 <dr class='alt5'>"Professing to be wise, they became fools, and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like corruptible man—and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things." (Rom 1:22-23)</dr class='alt5'> There are stone images and there are mental images. Now, none of us would want to make God like a created thing, but if we think that God has a body (a male body, some will attest), or is subject to time and space (who can only be in only one place at one time), and needs to have something in order to create (that He needs a pre-existing "substance"), just like we need physical matter to fashion things, then we have inadvertently reduced God to an "image made to look like mortal man."</p>
<h3>
God is not created
</h3>
<p>
He does not have a body. Bodies are put together or composed, and God is neither put together nor composed of anything. He is the Creator, not the created. Until God created, there was nothing. Only God is eternal. Only God is uncreated. There is no eternal matter or "spiritual substance" that co-existed with God. That would mean that God did not create everything, and such a God is not the God of the Bible. Such a God is a limited God, a less-than-supreme God, a God who needs something beside Himself to act as God.
</p>
<h3>
God is personal 
</h3>
<p>
He relates to us in a personal way. We should never think of God as so transcendent that we cannot relate to Him in a personal way. That, again, is precisely why He reveals Himself to us in the Bible in human terms, in terms we can understand. That is why the Son of God became human to reconcile us to God. 
<p class='block'><dr class='alt1'>
God wants a close and personal relationship with us. He wants fellowship with us. That is the reason He made us, and He has made it possible (despite our sin) through our mediator, the God-made-human Jesus Christ.</p>
