<h1>
Gifts of the Holy Spirit
</h1>
<p>
Gifts of the Spirit are special abilities 

provided by the Holy Spirit to Christians 

for the purpose of building up the body of 

Christ. <br>The list of spiritual gifts in 1 

Cor 12:8-10 includes wisdom, 

knowledge, faith, healing, miracles, 

prophecy, discerning of spirits, speaking 

in tongues, and interpretation of tongues. 

Similar lists appear in Eph 4:7-13 

and Rom 12:3-8. The gifts of the Spirit 

are simply God enabling believers to do 

what He has called us to do. 
<dr class='alt5'>
"His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by glory and virtue," <br>(2 Peter 1:3)</dr class='alt5'> <br> The 

gifts of the Holy Spirit are part of 

everything we need to fulfil His purposes 

for our lives.
</p>
<h3>
Gifts of the Spirit - The Definitions
</h3>
<p>
There is some controversy as to the 

precise nature of each of the gifts of the 

Spirit, but here is a list of spiritual gifts 

and their basic definitions.
<ul>
<li>
The gift of wisdom seems to be the ability 

to make decisions and give guidance that 

is according to God's will.
</li>
<li>
The gift of knowledge is the ability to have 

an in-depth understanding of a spiritual 

issue or situation.
<li>
The gift of faith is being able to trust God 

and encourage others to trust God, no 

matter the circumstances.
</li>
<li>
The gift of healing is the miraculous ability 

to use God's healing power to restore a 

person who is sick, injured, or suffering.
</li>
<li>
The gift of miracles is being able to 

perform signs and wonders that give 

authenticity to God's Word and the 

Gospel message.
</li>
<li>
The gift of prophecy is being able to 

proclaim a message from God.
</li>
<li>
The gift of discerning spirits is the ability 

to determine whether or not a message, 

person, or event is truly from God.
</li>
<li>
The gift of tongues is the ability to speak 

in a foreign language that you do not have 

knowledge of, in order to communicate 

with someone who speaks that language.
</li>
<li>
The gift of interpreting tongues is the 

ability to translate the tongues speaking 

and communicate it back to others in your 

own language.
</li>
<li>
The gift of administration is being able to 

keep things organised and in accordance 

with God's principles.
</li>
<li>
The gift of helps is always having the 

desire and ability to help others, to do 

whatever it takes to get a task 

accomplished.
</li></ul>
</p>
<h3>
Gifts of the Spirit - Which One(s) Do I 

Have?
</h3>
<p>
The Holy Spirit distributes the gifts of the Spirit as He sees fit<br>(1 Cor 12:7-11)
<br> God does not want us to be 

ignorant of how He wants us to serve 

Him. However, it is very easy for us to get 

caught up in what spiritual gift(s) we have 

and then only serve God in that area of 

ministry. That is not how it works. God 

calls us to obediently serve Him. He will 

equip us with whatever gifts of the Spirit 

we need to accomplish the task or tasks 

He has called us to. Yes, God calls some 

to be teachers and gives them the gift of 

teaching, but that does not excuse the 

person from serving God in other ways as 

well. Is it beneficial to know what spiritual 

gift(s) God has given you? Of course, it 

is. Is it wrong to focus so much on 

spiritual gifts that we miss other 

opportunities to serve God? Yes!
</p> 
<p>
There is no magic formula or spiritual gift 

test that can tell you what gifts of the 

Spirit you possess. What we need to 

focus on is serving God. Do you see a 

need in your church? Do what you can to 

meet it. Is there a position in a ministry 

that is vacant? Pray as to whether God 

would have you fill it. If we seek God's will 

and obey His leading, He will always 

equip us with whatever gifts of the Spirit 

we need. Spiritual gift tests can be of 

some value in determining what areas 

God has especially gifted you. As always, 

though, place far more emphasis on 

God's Word and submitting to the Lord's 

leading than you do on the results of a 

spiritual gift test.
</p>
<h3>
Gifts of the Spirit - What Are the Gifts 

Used For?
</h3>
<p>
The Apostle Paul indicated that the gifts of 

the Spirit are equally valid, but not equally 

valuable. Their value is determined by 

their worth to the church. In dealing with 

this matter, he used the analogy of the 

human body. All members of the body 

have functions, Paul declared, but some 

are more important than others (1 

Cor 12:12-26). The service of 

each Christian should be in proportion to 

the gifts which he possesses (1 

Cor 12-14). All believers, as 

members of the body of Christ, must be 

serving together in order for the body to 

be fully-functional. That is why a church 

needs pastors, teachers, helpers, 

servants, administrators, those with great 

faith, etc.</p> 

<p class='block'><i><dr class='alt1'>
All of the gifts of the Holy Spirit 

working together are needed to produce 

the full potential of the church. Since the 

gifts of the Spirit are gifts of grace, their 

use must be controlled by the rule of love 

- the greatest of all the gifts of the Spirit (1 

Cor 13).
