<h1> Do not misuse God's name <br>The Third Commandment</h1>
<p class="crb">
Understanding how observing the third commandment is essential in developing a proper relationship with God.</p>
<h3>
Introduction</h3>
<p>
The relationship based on love and respect that we have with our parents mirrors our relationship with God, our spiritual Father. Just as our parents give us rules and obligations to follow for our benefit, so does our spiritual Father. These guidelines are God’s instruction on how to have a better life now and provide us the opportunity for eternal life in the future! God’s instructions are found in His Ten Commandments. These commandments teach us the proper relationship we should have towards God and our fellow human beings. This discussion guide will help the user understand how observing the third commandment is essential in developing that proper relationship with God.</p>
<h3>
The Third Commandment Stated</h3>
<p>
We show our love to God by honouring and obeying Him. We should respect and worship Him to the greatest of our abilities. One of the most important ways to respect God is found in the Third Commandment. The Third Commandment concerns the sanctity of God’s name. We are commanded by God to honour and respect His name:<br> <dr class='alt5'>"You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain; for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain" (Exodus:20:7.)</dr class='alt5'><br> "Vain" means empty, useless, false, unreal, and worthless. In short, taking God’s name in vain refers to the abuse, misuse, blasphemy, cursing, or manipulation of the Lord’s name.</p> <p>So, use of God’s name in vain involves:</p>

<p><dr class='alt1'>Trivialising His name by looking at it as being insignificant. </p>
<p> <dr class='alt1'>Trying to use it to advance negative purposes (the way priests of false religions used the names of their false gods).</p>
<p> <dr class='alt1'>Using it in worship thoughtlessly. </p>
<p> <dr class='alt1'>Using profanity or blasphemy is obvious violations of the third Commandment. Sometimes people substitute words (euphemisms) for the name of God. For example, "Gee" or "Golly" is sometimes used in exclamations.</p>
<h3>
The Third Commandment &mdash; our Relationship with God</h3>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>
"Let everyone who names the name of Christ depart from iniquity." <br>(2 Timothy 2:19)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p><dr class='alt5'>
 "… You who preach that a man should not steal, do you steal? You who say, 'Do not commit adultery,' do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples? You who make your boast in the law, do you dishonour God through breaking the law? For 'the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,' as it is written." (Romans 2:21-24)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p><dr class='alt3'>
 "Therefore you shall keep My commandments and perform them: I am the Lord. You shall not profane My holy name, but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel." Leviticus 22:31-32</dr class='alt3'></p>
<p>
According to the dictionary and Thesaurus, the term "to honour" means "to treat with significance." To treat something with significance is the opposite of taking something "in vain."
The commandment includes a stern warning to those who would take His name in vain (Exodus:20:7). </p>
<p>
<b>Comment:</b> Why would you find it offensive if others were to treat your name disrespectfully? Names identify and instruct as to what something is. We all want good and honourable things associated with our names, because our names are reflections of who we are. All agree that a strong relationship is based upon respect. One of the most important ways to respect God is by reverencing His name. He tells us not to only obey Him, but also to hold His name as holy.
King David was a man after God's own heart (Acts:13:22).</p>
<p>
How do you think a person will treat Christ's name when he or she realises that salvation is only through Jesus' name (John:20:31; Acts:2:21; 4:12), that we receive the Holy Spirit in His name (John:14:26), and that God will answer prayers in His name (John:16:23)?</p>

<h3>God's Names</h3>
<p>
The Bible reveals a number of God's names. "El" means the Almighty or God the Omnipotent. "Elohim" is the plural form of El. "Jehovah" is the common spelling of the Hebrew name of God which means the Eternal or the Immutable One. He lives forever and His character never changes. "Jesus" means, appropriately, "Jehovah the Saviour." "Christ" means "the Anointed" as were priests, prophets and kings in Israel. Each name or title reveals something of God's character or divine nature. 
What does each name/title reveal about God? What does each name reveal about His relationship to each of us?</p>
<ul>
<li>Exodus:15:26</li>
<li>Psalm:23:1</li>
<li>Exodus:17:15</li>
<li>Jeremiah:23:6</li>
<li>Exodus:31:13</li>
<li>Revelation:19:11</li>
<li>I Samuel 1:3</li>
<li>Revelation:19:13</li>
<li>Psalm:7:17</li>
<li>Revelation:19:16</li></ul>
<h3>
Summary</h3>
<p><dr class='alt5'>
Jesus said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the first and great commandment" (Matt 22:37-38)</dr class='alt5'> <br>To love God is to respect and honour Him. God loves us just as our parents do. Like our parents, He shows us His love by instructing and guiding us. Our relationship with Him can be peaceful and strong if we follow His instruction with respect and loyalty. Reverencing God in all ways is how we show our respect and loyalty. Since God is good, all good things should be associated with Him and, that includes His name. We are well blessed for having a proper relationship with God. God intends that we bear His name someday (Revelation:3:12; 14:1)! Our blessing is becoming part of the God family and living with Him in His Kingdom forever. It is a reward of eternal life!</p>
