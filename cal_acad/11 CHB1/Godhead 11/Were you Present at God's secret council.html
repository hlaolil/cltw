 <h1>
Were you Present at <br>God's Secret Council
</h1>
<h3>
In union with the ascended One
</h3>
<p>
This secret of the ascended life, that we are in union with the ascended One, is revealed by two Hebrew words. 

The first describes a secret council, a family circle in which secrets are shared. It carries the ideas of fellowship and counsel. The other word speaks about our covering and protection. The first word has to do with our fellowship with Christ. The second has to do with our safety in Christ.</p> 
<p>
First, the Hebrew word translated as "secret" or "counsel" in the five references given below is sode (Strong's #5475), and it means, "a session, a company of persons (in close deliberation); by implication, intimacy, consultation; council (familiar conversations), divan, circle (familiar friends), intimacy with God (familiar converse)." Its root means, "to sit down together." </p>
<p>
The secret of the ascended life is our union with Him in the Most Holy Place. <br>The ascended life is His life.
<dr class='alt5'>
"Have you heard the counsel of God? ..." (Job 15:8)</dr class='alt5'> 
Young person, you who are about to graduate from high school, have you heard the secret of God? You love to listen to your favourite music on your MP3 player or iPod, but have you ever listened in to the sound of God's council? You who will be parents for the first time in the next five years, are you aware of this privileged mystery? 
<dr class='alt5'>
"Just as I was in the days of my prime, when the friendly counsel of God was over my tent; when the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were around me; when my steps were bathed with cream, and the rock poured out rivers of oil for me!" (Job 29:4-6)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
Have you ever sat down and talked together with God? Have you heard the secret of God? Has He ever invited you into His circle? Is the secret of God upon your tabernacle, your life? 
<dr class='alt5'>
"The secret of the Lord is with those who fear Him, and He will show them His covenant". (Psa 25:14) </dr class='alt5'></p>
<h3>
Do you speak to the Lord
</h3>
<p>
Do you fear and reverence the Lord? Have you ever been intimate with God and Him with you? Did you speak with Him this morning? Only those who fear Him will sit down and talk with Him. 
<dr class='alt5'>
For who has stood in the counsel of the Lord, and has perceived and heard His word?... (Jer 23:18)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
I would like to ask every preacher on the planet this question.<br> To understand the Bible, you must spend time with the Author. Have you "perceived" (seen) His Word? 
<dr class='alt5'>
"Surely the Lord God does nothing, unless He reveals His secret to His servants the prophets". (Amos 3:7)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
Real prophets live in the inner sanctuary. We listen more than we speak. <dr class='alt5'><br>For He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God does not give the Spirit by measure. (John 3:34; 14:24; 20:21).</dr class='alt5'> </p>
<p>
It troubles me that so many immature Christians and insecure preachers think, "If I could just get to know this famous person, or if I could just break into that inner circle of influence…" Even famous people are mere people. But have you been introduced to Him? Would you like to fellowship His circle? Have you ever met with God in His secret place? Because of Jesus' shed blood, we can sit down at His table and talk with Him, face to face. 
 <dr class='alt5'>
"Therefore, brethren, having boldness to enter the Holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which He consecrated for us, through the veil, that is, His flesh,  and having a High Priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith," (Heb 10:19-22) </dr class='alt5'></p> 
<p>
The ascended life begins at our new birth, when we are  <dr class='alt5'>"born again," (John 3:7) </dr class='alt5'>literally, "born from above" . From that moment, every child of God is privileged by the blood of Jesus to boldly enter the holiest of all. His grace permits the youngest Christian to go in, sit down in His divine presence, be still, and then listen to God talk to Himself!</p> 
<p>
The grandest truth of the New Covenant in His blood is the rent veil. Now you can hear His voice in your spirit. The door is open (Rev. 4:1). He tore the curtain. Come in and sit down together with God. Your ears are about to hear privileged information. 

This high calling, this ascended life, is not deep and mysterious. It is not a spiritual Never-Never land. In the place far above, you convene with God. As with intimate friends, both talk and both listen. The ascended life is the life of hearing His voice. 
<dr class='alt5'>
"that which we have seen and heard we declare to you, that you also may have fellowship with us; and truly our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ". (1 John 1:3)</dr class='alt5'> </p>
<h3>
God's Council the Godhead
</h3>
<p>
The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit-sit in secret council. Have you ever heard them talk to themselves about you? You are the apple of Their eye (Deut. 32:10; Psa 17:8). You are on their mind all the time-God has a mind full of man <dr class='alt5'>"What is man that You are mindful of him," (Psa 8:4).</dr class='alt5'> <br>
Within the inner circle of Himself, God took counsel with Himself about you before you were born. The Godhead deliberated and consulted together concerning your destiny. Their purposed will has predetermined the greatness of your life. Do you have any idea what they talked about? Have you heard that secret? Now, because of His blood, you can go right into the planning chambers! The secret of the ascended life is our union with the ascended One who is our life. </p>
<p>
Are you bored? Don't know what to do with your time? I know why. You've never heard His secret, His plans and envisioned purpose for His glorious Church.
<dr class='alt5'>But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with Him. (1 Cor 6:17) </dr class='alt5'>
<dr class='alt5'><br>
For we are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones. "For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh." This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church. Nevertheless let each one of you in particular so love his own wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband. <br>(Eph 5:30-33)</dr class='alt5'><br>  

As with married love, we are joined to the Lord in covenantal union. There are some things you never learned about your beloved until you were married. That was privileged information that you didn't know until you became one with him (her). In marriage, there is an intimacy, confidentiality, and a holiness; something happens within the marriage covenant that is so precious.</p> 
<p>
Is there a call of God on your life? Have you gone into the secret chambers, cried puddles of tears, and said, "Oh, God, open to me your mysteries"? 

I remember a young man who was saved at the age of 17, then filled with the Holy Ghost and called to the ministry at 19. But I really didn't learn about God until I met those men and women who lived with God in a higher dimension. When they talked, they talked out of a different place. Those encounters with real apostles and prophets, male and female, changed my life. </p>
<p>
The most prized thing I have ever encountered while breathing is to sit in the King's council and listen to God talk to Himself. In 1979, the year our oldest daughter April was born, the heavens opened and I saw the throne room (Rev. 4). I envisioned the mercy-seat. Ever since, I have maintained a conscious knowing that I am seated with Him in heavenly places. Even in moments of duress and temptation, I am deeply aware of my sharing His ascended life. I am speaking to and writing to you now out of that.</p> 
<h3>
Have you heard the voice of God?<br> Have you heard His secret? </h3>
<p>
Behold God's head. Behold His wisdom-He is too wise to make a mistake. He made you, and you are not a mistake. Behold His hand. Behold His power-He is too powerful to fail. And then behold His heart. Behold His love-He loves you too much to hurt you. 
<dr class='alt5'>
"I call to remembrance my song in the night; I meditate within my heart, and my spirit makes diligent search". (Psa 77:6) </dr class='alt5'><br>

As I travel throughout this country and the nations, I find many times when there is no one around that is spiritual enough to talk to. In those moments, I talk to myself and commune with my own heart. Sometimes when I get discouraged, I will play one of my own tapes or read one of my own books to encourage myself (1 Sam. 30:6). 

God sits in the secret chambers and talks with Himself. He does that until somebody joins Him. He is in session now. Won't you come in? The door is open ...</p> 
<p>
The secret of the ascended life is consciously knowing that you are one with Him, and have the legal right to sit down with Him in His private council. 

The first word for "secret" had to do with our fellowship with Christ. The other has to do with our safety in Christ. 

The second Hebrew word for "secret" speaks about a secret place, a hiding place, and covert. It is say'-ther (Strong's #5643), and it means, "a cover; a covering, a shelter, a hiding place, secrecy; protection." This is the Most Holy Place, the secret place of the Most High.<BR> Consider these usages: 
<dr class='alt5'>
"For in the time of trouble He shall hide me in His pavilion; in the secret place of His tabernacle He shall hide me; He shall set me high upon a rock". (Psa 27:5)</dr class='alt5'> 
<dr class='alt5'><BR>
You shall hide them in the secret place of Your presence from the plots of man; You shall keep them secretly in a pavilion from the strife of tongues (Psa 31:20)</dr class='alt5'>
<dr class='alt5'>
You are my hiding place; You shall preserve me from trouble;
You shall surround me with songs of deliverance. Selah. (Psa 32:7)</dr class='alt5'>
<dr class='alt5'><br>
I will abide in Your tabernacle forever; I will trust in the shelter of Your wings. Selah (Psa 61:4)</dr class='alt5'><br>
<dr class='alt5'>
You called in trouble, and I delivered you; I answered you in the secret place of thunder; (Psa 81:7)</dr class='alt5'><br>
<dr class='alt5'>
He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty. (Psa 91:1)</dr class='alt5'><br>
<dr class='alt5'>
You are my hiding place and my shield; I hope in Your word. (Psa 119:114)</dr class='alt5'></p> 
<p>
Again, the first Hebrew word and set of Scriptures described our fellowship with Christ. This second word and set of Scriptures just expressed the safety of our being in Christ! </p>
<p>
The secret of the ascended life is our union with Him in the Most Holy Place. The ascended life is His life.
