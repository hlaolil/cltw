 <h1>
The Character of Christ
</h1>
<p>
Christ, who is the Son, of God, reflects 

God’s own glory, and everything about 

Him represents God exactly. He sustains 

the universe by the mighty power of His 

command. After He died to cleanse us 

from the stain of sin, He sat down in the 

place of honour at the right hand of the 

majestic God of heaven. 
</p>
<p>
Being the image of God, Jesus Christ 

exhibits five characteristics that set Him 

high above all others. These 

characteristics prove that He is who He 

says He is. As Christians we are to be 

Christ like, a reflection of Him. 
</p>
<p>
As Christians we are to exhibit 

characteristics of Christ in our lives. Let’s 

look at the five characteristics of Jesus 

Christ and see if we can see any parallel 

between Jesus Christ and us.
</p>
<h3>
He has divine support.
</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
Jesus Christ is divinely supported by God 

the Father and the Holy Spirit. 
</li>
<li>
God is our father; Jesus Christ is our 

Saviour, and the Holy Spirit dwells in us.
</li>
<li>
It must therefore be safe to say that we 

too have divine support. We have great 

power and strength that we have 

inherited. 
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
He has all power.
</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
He is the creator, the alpha and omega. 

None can equal Him or His power. 
</li>
<li>
Mightier that the wind. Because He is the 

creator of the wind.
</li>
<li>
Stronger than the fury of a storm. 

Because He is the creator of the storm.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
He can cleanse all sins.
</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Our sins are cleansed.
</li>
<li>
There is mighty power in His blood.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
He is exalted on high.
</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
We shall be lifted up high.
</li>
<li>
We should exalt Him on high. All praise 

should go to Him. 
</li>
</ul>
<h3>
He is high ranking.
</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>
We are heirs of His ranking.
</li>
<li>
There is no one that is above Him, for He 

ranks above all.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
