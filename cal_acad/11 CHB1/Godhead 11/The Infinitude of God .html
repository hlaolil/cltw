<h1>
The Infinitude of God 
</h1>
<p>
What does it mean when we talk about the infinitude of God . . . What does it mean when we talk about God being infinite? We are speaking about how big God is, how great God is.<br>
<dr class='alt5'>
Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised; and His greatness is unsearchable. (Psalm 145:3)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
When we talk about the infinite nature of God, we mean that He has no limits or boundaries in time or space or extent or magnitude of any kind. He is immeasurably great . . . indefinitely or exceedingly great . . . unlimited or unmeasurable in extent of space, duration of time . . . . He is unbounded, unlimited and endless.</p>
<p>
As we set out to consider the infinitude of God, we must first consider a question: Can finite beings who measure everything they experience truly conceive of infinity? Clearly, it is a challenge! Here is God’s pointed question,<br> <dr class='alt5'>"To whom will you liken Me, and make Me equal
And compare Me, that we should be alike?"(Isaiah 46:5 )</dr class='alt5'></p> 
<p>
A. W. Tozer explains:
God dwells in a mode of being totally beyond us and wholly above us and infinitely removed from us so when we think about God we are trying to think about someone unlike anything we know. God says, Who am I like? or to whom will you compare me? The answer being, nobody; nobody is like God, nothing is like God. God is like Himself. We attempt to conceive of a mode of being with which we are completely unfamiliar; not merely somewhat unfamiliar, but completely unfamiliar.</p>
<h3>
Our limitless and measureless God
</h3>
<p>
The God of glory is limitless and measureless. All of God's attributes [all that is a part of God’s nature] are limitless and measureless. Not only is God limitless, but he cannot be limited. All existence can trace its source back to God, therefore God exceeds the sum of all existence.</p>
<p>
Here is an amazing truth to consider: As Scientists are able to explore deeper and deeper into the minute particles of the atom and farther and farther into the great expanse of the heavens, they continue to discover that there is more to be discovered. Could God have created an infinite world? This is a curious question to consider. But one thing is clear, at least as far as man will ever understand it, the universe is infinite. And God created all of it with the simple command of His word.</p>
<p class='block'><dr class='alt1'>So, how big is YOUR God? What do your doubts, fears, discouragement, and worries say about how big your God is? Let’s get to know the infinite God of glory! </p>
