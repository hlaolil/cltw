   <h1>
The Holy Spirit and Discipleship
</h1>
<p class='block'><dr class='alt'>
More than any other New Testament 

author Luke speaks of the Spirit of God. It 

has been observed that the Spirit is the 

connecting thread which runs through 

both Luke and Acts. Luke does this 

primarily by linking the ministry of the 

Spirit with the birth of Jesus in Luke 1-2 

with the birth of His Church in Acts 1-2. 

This parallel structure is also evident in 

the Spirit-filled ministry of Jesus and the 

Spirit-filled ministry of Christ's disciples in 

Acts. In addition, Luke is also careful to 

ground the miraculous work of the Spirit 

in the Old Testament births and the 

prophetic ministry of Elijah and Elisha. 

Various aspects of the work of the Spirit 

are outlined below.
</p>
<h3>
The Holy Spirit Gives Birth
</h3>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>“Then Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, since I do not know a man?” And the angel answered and said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God. (Luke 1:34-35)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>Then Peter said to them, “Repent, and let every one of you be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call.” (Acts 2:38-39)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
Just as the birth of a child together brings 

young and old together in wonder, Luke 

uses the birth of Jesus and the church to 

unite the Jewish Old Covenant 

community of faith with the flood of 

incoming New Testament Gentile 

believers.
</p>
<p>
The unity of the community in Luke-Acts 

is highlighted by discussing the role of the 

Holy Spirit as inaugurator in the birth of 

John and Jesus in Luke 1-2 and the birth 

of the Church in Acts 1-2. Luke also 

shows that just as the Great Commission 

at the end of Matthew acts as an index to 

the gospel which proceeded it, the 

programmatic discourse in Luke 4:16-30 

serves as a preface to both the ministry 

of Jesus and the Church which would 

follow it. Parallels were drawn between 

the Nazareth periscope and the ministry 

of Paul.
</p>
<p>
It is important for the modern-day church 

to realise that it is only through the new 

birth, conversion that anyone can enter 

the covenant community. This was 

profoundly illustrated by the importance of 

the miracle birth as shown in the birth of 

Isaac, John the Baptist, Jesus and the 

believers in the book of Acts.
</p>
<h3>
Being Filled with the Spirit
</h3>
<p>

<dr class='alt5'>But the angel said to him, “Do not be afraid, Zacharias, for your prayer is heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call his name John. And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth. For he will be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink. He will also be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb.<br>(Luke 1:13-15)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>Then Jesus, being filled with the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, (Luke 4:1)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p><dr class='alt5'>“The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me,
Because He has anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor;
He has sent Me to heal the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed; (Luke 4:18)</dr class='alt5'>
</p> 
<p> <dr class='alt5'>"To proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord.” (Luke 4:19)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>Jesus’ announcement that the <dr class='alt5'>“Spirit 

of the Lord is upon Me”</dr class='alt5'> through the 

citation of Isa. 61:1 in Luke 4:18 affirms 

what Luke has already been hinting at by 

the activity of the Spirit within the birth 

stories. Namely, that the Holy Spirit is 

going to be a major theme within 

Luke-Acts. The sermon at Nazareth also 

underlines the prophetic ministry of Jesus 

as well as His intention to minister to the 

marginalised within the society.
</p>
<p>
Jesus Himself is closely linked with the 

Holy Spirit in the opening events of His 

ministry. The three episodes of the 

baptism (where Jesus is filled with the 

Spirit); the temptation (where Jesus is led 

by the Spirit) and now the public 

proclamation in the community at 

Nazareth can be viewed as an integrated 

narrative, the launching of the public 

ministry of Jesus—the charismatic 

Christ.
</p> 
<p>
Being “filled” or “full” of the Spirit is a 

dominantly Lukan term. Jesus is 

described as being <dr class='alt5'>“being filled with the Holy Spirit” (Luke 4:1)</dr class='alt5'> at 

the temptation and <br> <dr class='alt5'>“full of the 

joy through the Spirit” (Luke 10:21)</dr class='alt5'> when 

He praised the Father for revealing truth 

to the humble.
</p> 
<p>
Unlike Matthew and Mark, Luke alone 

pictures Jesus returning from the desert 

to Galilee <dr class='alt5'>“in the power of the Spirit” 

(Luke 4:14).</dr class='alt5'> Through these unique portrayals of 

Christ’s public ministry Luke desires to 

highlight the important role of the Spirit in 

the life of Christ and by extension the life 

of the Church. 
</p>
<p>
Thus Luke clearly links the decisive role 

of the Holy Spirit in the life of Jesus and 

His disciples. Lest the Gentile believers 

forget the foundational work of the Spirit in 

the Old Testament prophetic ministry of 

Elijah and Elisha, Luke is careful to draw 

distinct parallels between Jesus and 

these Old Testament prophets.
</p>
<h3>
Luke, the Church and the Holy Spirit
</h3>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>Behold, I send the Promise of My Father upon you; but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high.” (Luke 24:49)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>When the Day of Pentecost had fully come, they were all with one accord in one place. And suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. Then there appeared to them divided tongues, as of fire, and one sat upon each of them. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance. (Acts 2:1-4)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>And when they had prayed, the place where they were assembled together was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness. (Acts 4:31)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>Then the Spirit said to Philip, “Go near and overtake this chariot.”<br> Now when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, so that the eunuch saw him no more; and he went on his way rejoicing. (Acts 8:29, 39)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>While Peter thought about the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Behold, three men are seeking you. <br> While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard the word. And those of the circumcision(circumcised believers) who believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also. (Acts 10:19; 44-45)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p> 
<dr class='alt5'>As they ministered to the Lord and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, “Now separate to Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” Then, having fasted and prayed, and laid hands on them, they sent them away.<br>
So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus. (Acts 13:2-4)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
Luke’s concept of the church is so radical 

in its constitution that it is only through the 

power of the Holy Spirit that the age-old 

hostilities between the Jew and the 

Gentile could be broken down in order to 

form a new community under the 

authority of the risen Lord.
</p>
<p>
The Spirit’s testimony in Acts 2 springs 

forth on the day of Pentecost when those 

who had been discipled by Jesus were 

united and waiting for the promised 

blessing of the Spirit.
</p>
<p>
For the disciples, the ascension marks 

the end of their apprenticeship and the 

beginning of their missionary task for 

which their discipleship has prepared 

them. The same Spirit which Jesus 

received at the birth of His ministry is 

given to the disciples at the birth of the 

church. Therefore Acts can be seen as 

the continuation of the Lukan Gospel, not 

in the sense that it relates what Jesus 

continued to do, but how His followers 

carried out His commission under the 

guidance of His Spirit.
</p>
<p>
The literature of the New Testament 

reveals three primary dimensions of the 

activity of the Holy Spirit:

<p> <dr class='alt3'>Salvation<dr class='alt3'>
</p> 
<p>  
<dr class='alt3'>Sanctification and,</dr class='alt3'>
</p> 
<p>  
<dr class='alt3'>Service. </dr class='alt3'>
</p>
<p> 
These dimensions are interdependent 

and complimentary. However, in the 

development of Protestant theology, the 

Reformed tradition has emphasised the 

activity of the Spirit in 

initiation-conversion, the Wesleyan 

tradition has subsequently emphasised 

the activity of the Spirit in holiness or 

sanctification, and the Pentecostal 

tradition has finally emphasised the 

charismatic activity of the Spirit in worship 

and service.
</p> 
<p>
It was pre-eminently through the Spirit 

that the risen Christ was present in the 

community. In Mark and Matthew the 

Spirit is not particularly prominent and is 

rarely linked with mission. Not so in Luke. 

Among the evangelists he may be singled 

out as the theologian of the Holy Spirit.
</p> 
<p>
The Spirit in Acts is explicitly cited as the 

guiding force of the disciples in either 

directing their activity (see Acts 2:4c; 

4:31; 8:29, 39; 10:19, 44; 11:28; 13:2,4; 

15:28; 20:22, 28) or hindering it 

(16:6, 7; 21:4).
</p> 
<p>
Luke's concept of the church is so radical 

in its constitution that it is only through the 

power of the Holy Spirit that the age-old 

hostilities between the Jew and the 

Gentile could be broken down in order to 

form a new community under the 

authority of the risen Lord. While the 

Spirit-induced praise and witness are 

surely the most evidential fruits of the 

Spirit’s working, they by no means 

exhaust the more foundational work of the 

Spirit in the formation of the community 

itself. This relationship between the 

foundational and evidential work of the 

Spirit is more thoroughly discussed in the 

following sections which deal with 

Pentecost.
</p>
<p>
Just as Jesus acknowledged the work of 

the Spirit as the basis for His own 

ministry in Luke 4:18, Peter stands up 

and explains to the wondering multitude 

that it is the Spirit as promised in Joel 

2:28-32 that correctly explains their 

ministry. Peter’s first sermon occupies 

most of the chapter (2:14-39) and is 

bracketed by the corporate meeting of the 

disciples both before (2:1-4) and after 

(2:42-47) Pentecost. 
</p>
<p>
Peter acts as a spokesperson for the 

Twelve and stands up to explain the gift of 

tongues which had provoked both wonder 

and questioning from the diaspora Jews 

who had gathered in Jerusalem for the 

feast (Acts 2:11-7-13).
</p>
<h3>
The Baptism and the Holy Spirit
</h3>
<p><dr class='alt5'>
Now when they heard this, they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, “Men and brethren, what shall we do?” Then Peter said to them, “Repent, and let every one of you be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.<br> For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call.” And with many other words he testified and exhorted them, saying, “Be saved from this perverse generation.”<br> Then those who gladly received his word were baptised; and that day about three thousand souls were added to them. (Acts 2:37-41)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
Peter's spirit-inspired sermon which 

uplifted the crucified and risen Saviour 

changed the assembly’s question from 

<dr class='alt5'>“Whatever could this mean?”(Acts 2:12)</dr class='alt5'>  to <dr class='alt5'> 
“Men and brethren, what shall we do?” Then Peter said to them, “Repent, and let every one of you be baptised in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. For the promise is to you and to your children, and to all who are afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call.” (Acts 2:37-39).</dr class='alt5'> 
</p>
<p>
Most importantly, baptism is presented as 

the means of joining the Christian 

community (cf. Acts 2:41). Luke had now 

traced in his gospel and Acts how the 

locus of the Spirit’s activity had moved 

from the periphery of the Jordan to the 

heart of Jerusalem. While John focused 

the message on preparing his hearers to 

meet the coming Lord, Peter declares 

that Jesus indeed is the Risen Lord. 

Whereas the response by the repentant 

crowd and the subsequent appeal to be 

baptised by John and Peter are the same, 

the promised coming of the Spirit as fire 

in John is fulfilled in the Eschatological 

“last days” at Pentecost.
