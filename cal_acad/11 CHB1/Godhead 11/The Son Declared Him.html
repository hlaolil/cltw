<h1> The Son Declared Him</h1>
<p>
<font color="royalblue">
No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him. (John 1:18) </font>
<p> <font color="royalblue">No man has seen God</font> — <br>With bodily eyes, yet believers see Him with the eye of faith.<br>
 <font color="royalblue">Who is in the bosom of the Father</font> —<br> The expression denotes the highest unity, and the most intimate knowledge.<br>
 <font color="royalblue">The glory of God has been declared</font> —<br> In the person of Jesus Christ.</p><p> Did Jesus come radiating beauty everywhere He went? Was there a heavenly aura about Him, a halo over His head? Did He glow like burnished bronze, so that anybody could point and say, "Hey, there goes God"? No. He revealed the glory of God by what He did and by what He said. And much of what He said is recorded in this Book — for you and me.</p>
<h2>
The Visible Glory of God</h2>
<p>
Moses asked to see the visible glory of God, and He proclaimed His name verbally. In John 1, Jesus is saying, "If you want to see the mind and nature of God, if you want to see His attitudes, look at Me." God reveals Himself and declares His glory to us through the life, works, and words of Jesus of Nazareth as He opens our minds by His Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>
Jesus is "the way" because of all mankind, only He, unmarred by sin, has intimate knowledge of God. Knowing God depends on our knowledge of the truth about Jesus. He shows the way we must walk, the direction and manner of living and relating to others. This is precisely the knowledge Jesus gives. Many times when we ask directions in a strange city, the response confuses us because we are unfamiliar with the town. But when we ask directions of Jesus, He says, "Come, follow Me, and I will take you there."</p>
<p>
Some people may teach truth, but He embodies truth; He is "the truth." A man may teach geometry, and his character may not affect his teaching. But if one teaches moral truth, character is paramount. Keeping the third commandment properly revolves around knowing the truth about God and His way.</p>
<p class="block">
<font size="+1"<font color="firebrick">Colossians 1:15; 2:9</font> are among the strongest statements in the Bible about the divine nature of Jesus:<font color="royalblue"> "He is the image of the invisible God, the first born over all creation. (Col 1:15)</font> <font color="royalblue">... For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily." (Col 2:9).</font> He not only is equal to and reflects God, but He also reveals God to us because He is God. He is completely holy and has authority to judge the world.</p>
<p>
We can have no clearer view of God than by looking at Christ. He is the full revelation of God to man. He is the complete expression of God in a human body. He is unique: God became a man, imposing upon Himself the same time-space limitations as other men.</p>
<p>
He had every opportunity to waste time, get sick, eat gluttonously and become overweight, drink and experience a hangover, "fly off the handle" in anger, or attack others when someone pricked His vanity. He could have become bitter from rejection or depressed when things did not go His way. He could have worked or played with intense competitiveness to "win at all costs." He had to face death, His own as well as of loved ones. He could have felt "the deck was stacked" against Him.</p>
<p>
The gospels show God coping with life on the same terms as men. Now we can really see what kind of character God possesses. Jesus' life gives us first hand knowledge of what the true way of life is, allowing us to cooperate with Him in His purpose. Among many other things, we see God teaching, healing, sacrificing His life, correcting in love, guarding His flock, and patiently counseling.</p>
