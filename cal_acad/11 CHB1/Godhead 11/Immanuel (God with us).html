   <h1>Immanuel (God with us)</h1>
<p>
Immanuel is a Hebrew word meaning “God with us”.  The first time this is used in the Bible is in the Old Testament prophet Isaiah:
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>Therefore the Lord Himself will give you a sign: Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a Son, and shall call His name Immanuel. (Isaiah 7:14)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
Both Christian and Jewish scholars have debated the meaning and possible (single or multiple) fulfilments of this prophecy.  In any case, the New Testament gospel writer Matthew indicates that it finds at least one of its fulfilments in the birth of Jesus.<br>
<dr class='alt5'>An angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.  And she will bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.”  So all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying: “Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel,” which is translated, “God with us.” <br>(Matt 1:20-23)</dr class='alt5'> </p>
<p>
The idea here is that, although God is enthroned in heaven, far above all created things, He also comes near to us in the person of Jesus.  In more theological terms, God is simultaneously transcendent (above and distinct from His creation) and immanent (present in, and intimately involved with, His creation).</p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>For thus says the High and Lofty One who inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy: “I dwell in the high and holy place, with him who has a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. (Isaiah 57:15)</dr class='alt5'><br>
<dr class='alt5'> “Am I a God near at hand,” says the Lord,
“And not a God afar off? Can anyone hide himself in secret places, so I shall not see him?” says the Lord; “Do I not fill heaven and earth?” says the Lord. (Jer 23: 23-24)<dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
And here are three New Testament passages which emphasise the intimate spiritual union that Christians have with Christ:
<p> <dr class='alt5'> "A little while longer and the world will see Me no more, but you will see Me. Because I live, you will live also. At that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you. He who has My commandments and keeps them, it is he who loves Me. And he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and manifest Myself to him” (John 14:19-21)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p><dr class='alt5'> Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword? As it is written: “For Your sake we are killed all day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.” Yet in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. For I am persuaded that neither death nor life, nor angels nor principalities nor powers, nor things present nor things to come, nor height nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Rom 8:35-39)</dr class='alt5'><p>
<dr class='alt5'> Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ himself? Shall I then take the members of Christ and unite them with a prostitute? Never!  Do you not know that he who unites himself with a prostitute is one with her in body? For it is said, “The two will become one flesh.” But whoever is united with the Lord is one with him in spirit.  Flee from sexual immorality. All other sins a person commits are outside the body, but whoever sins sexually, sins against their own body. Do you not know that your bodies are temples of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have received from God? You are not your own; you were bought at a price. Therefore honour God with your bodies. (1 Cor 6:15-20)</p>
<p><p class='block'><dr class='alt1'>
The amazing thing is that, if we make a decision to give all of ourselves to God, He graciously gives all of Himself to us (or, at least, as much as we can handle) <dr class='alt5'></p>
