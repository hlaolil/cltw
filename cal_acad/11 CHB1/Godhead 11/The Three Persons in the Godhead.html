   <h1>The Three Persons in the Godhead</h1>
<p>
<h2>The Father is God</h2>
<p>
There are numerous verses in the scripture that reveals that the Father is God. </p>
<p><dr class='alt5'>"yet for us there is one God, the Father, of whom are all things" (I Cor 8:6)</dr class='alt5'>
 </p>
<p><dr class='alt5'>"Paul an apostle. . . through Jesus Christ, and God the Father." (Gal. 1:1)</dr class='alt5'> </p>
<p><dr class='alt5'>
 "At that time Jesus answered and said, “I thank You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth" (Matt 11:25)</dr class='alt5'> </p>
<p><dr class='alt5'>"God the Father has set His seal on Him.”" (John 6:27)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p> <dr class='alt5'>"According to the foreknowledge of God the Father." (1 Peter 1:2)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p> <dr class='alt5'>"That every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father." (Phil 2:11)</dr class='alt5'> </p>
<p><dr class='alt5'>"I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God." (John 20:17)</dr class='alt5'> </p>
<p><dr class='alt5'>"But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truth" (John 4:23)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p><dr class='alt5'> Jesus prayed to God the Father. (Mark 14:36, John 11:41;17:11).</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
<h2>The Word is God</h2>
<p>
Jesus is called "the Word" because He declares God to us and God speaks through Him. <br><dr class='alt5'>"God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets, has in these last days spoken to us by His Son" <br
>(Heb 1:1-2)</dr class='alt5'>.<br
><br
> Christ is the final spokesman of God. In the Saviour's title found in Rev 1 <dr class='alt5'><br>"I am Alpha and Omega" (Rev 1:8)</dr class='alt5'> is understood that He is God's alphabet, the one who spells out Deity, the one who utters all God has to say. <br>Even clearer is the testimony of John 1,<dr class='alt5'>"No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him. (John 1:18)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p><dr class='alt5'>"The Word of God" (John 1:1; Rev 19:13)</dr class='alt5'> means that Christ is God's way of expressing Himself just as our words express our thoughts and desires. The Word of God must be as eternal as God himself. Christ is also called <br><dr class='alt5'>"the Wisdom of God". (1 Cor 1:24)</dr class='alt5'><br> We cannot suggest that there was a time when God was without wisdom.<br> The Wisdom of God must be as eternal as God.
<p>
A <font color="firebrick">"Word"</font> is a medium of manifestation.</p> 
<p>A <font color="firebrick">"Word"</font> is a means of communication.</p> 
<p>A <font color="firebrick">"Word"</font> is a method of revelation.</p>
<p> And Christ, as the<font color="firebrick"> Word</font> reveals the attribute and perfection of God. He displayed God's power, He manifested God's wisdom, He exhibited His holiness, He made known His grace; and He unveiled His heart. In the Christ of the scripture is God fully and finally declared and nowhere else. The attributes which can be ascribed only to God are ascribed to Christ in the scripture. God could not be the eternal Father without an eternal Son. Son ship does not necessarily imply origin but may express the idea of relationship. Jesus Christ from everlasting to everlasting is the eternal Son of God the Father. He is without beginning and without end, for God is the eternal Father of the Lord Jesus Christ.
<p>
The everlasting Fatherhood of God is not at all contradicted by the scriptures that speak of Jesus Christ as the "first begotten". In Col 1:18 and Rev 1:5, this term simply denotes that Jesus Christ is the first to rise from the dead in His resurrected body, never to die again.</p> 
<p>In Rom 8:29, Col 1:15 and Heb 1:6 the term "first born" as applied to Christ, simply means that He has the place of pre-eminence just as the oldest son had in the Jewish family. He is to be honoured above all others through eternity as the God-man. The words "only begotten" is a compound word which simply means "only' and "kind or class". It affirms that Jesus Christ is the "unique Son", "the only one of His class."</p>
<p>
It asserts most positively the eternal relationship between the Father and the Son. It is actually a striking declaration of Christ's deity and of God's eternal Fatherhood.</p>
<p>
<h2>The Holy Spirit is God</h2>
<p>
The Holy Spirit is placed on a plane of absolute equality with the Father and the Son as Deity and is regarded equally with them as the source of all power and blessing. <dr class='alt5'><br
>" Peter said, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit?... You have not lied to men but to God.” (Acts 5:3,4)</dr class='alt5'> </p>
<p><dr class='alt5'>Our Lord Jesus Christ said: " And I will pray the Father, and He will give you another Helper, that He may abide with you forever— the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees Him nor knows Him; but you know Him, for He dwells with you and will be in you.  But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in My name, He will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all things that I said to you." (John 14:16,17,26)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
If the Holy Spirit is just an influence, then John 14:16 should read,<dr class='alt2'> "He will give you another Helper, that <font color="red"><font size="+1">IT</font></color="red"><font color="green"> may abide with you for ever."</color="green"> <font color="BLACK"><br>Instead we read <font color="royalblue">"that<font color="red"> <font size="+1"> HE</font><font color="royalblue"> may abide with you forever"</font> <font color="BLACK"><br>A personality possesses a mind, a will, and emotions. Certainly a mere influence does not have these characteristics, but we find them ascribed to the Holy Spirit.</p> 
<p>The divine wisdom of the Holy Spirit is indicated in I Cor 2,<br><dr class='alt5'> "But God has revealed them to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God. For what man knows the things of a man except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God." (I Cor 2:10,11)</dr class='alt5'><br>
The Holy Spirit is a person who knows the deep things of God and reveals them to us. </p>
<p>The Holy Spirit has a will. He says, <dr class='alt5'>" But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills." (I Cor 12:11).</p>
<p>
An influence or abstract power cannot choose to do anything. We find in this verse further proof of the personality of the Holy Spirit. The third quality of a personality is the ability to experience emotion, to feel joy and sorrow. That the Holy Spirit possesses this characteristic is clear from the scripture. </p>
<p>He loves, for the Apostle Paul in Rom 15 refers to<dr class='alt5'> "the love of the Spirit"<br>(Rom 15:30)</dr class='alt5'> </p>
<p>He is able to feel grief. Therefore, we are told, <dr class='alt5'>"And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God," (Eph 4:30).</p>
<p>
The Holy Spirit performs acts which can only be ascribed to a personality.</p>
<p> He speaks (Rev 2:7),</p> 
<p>He makes intercession (Rom 8:26),</p> 
<p>He teaches (John 14:26),</p> 
<p>He leads and guides (Rom 8:14).</p>
<p>
<h2>These Three are One</h2>
<p>
The unity of God was clearly expressed when the divine law was given through Moses: <dr class='alt5'><br>"The Lord is our God, the Lord alone (that is, the only one)"  (Deut 6:4)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p> Our Lord Jesus Christ confirmed this in Mark 12:29.</p> 
<p>The apostle Paul stated the same truth: <br><dr class='alt5'>"Now a mediator does not mediate for one only, but God is one." (Gal 3:20)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p> Likewise, the apostle James wrote: <dr class='alt5'><br>"You believe that there is one God. You do well." (James 2:19)</dr class='alt5'> </p>
<p>The cumulative evidence of these verses is that there is only one God.

<h2>Relationship within the Godhead</h2>
<p>
Within the Godhead, the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit share an equality of divine nature. It is noteworthy that, in the great trinitarian passages in the New Testament, the scriptures do not adhere to any rigid sequence when mentioning the divine persons, thereby avoiding any suggestion of superiority or inferiority within the Godhead. Indeed every possible arrangement of the divine names is found.
