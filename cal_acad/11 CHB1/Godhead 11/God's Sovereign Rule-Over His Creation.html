   <h1>God's Sovereign Rule<br>Over His Creation</h1>
<h3>
Sovereign God?
</h3>
<p>
Is the God of reality Sovereign in the fullest sense of that term in His universe and personal in His relationships with His creatures? Our study of God has shown that we must answer this question with a resounding, <i><b>Yes.</b></i><br> 
As Sovereign does He have a wise and comprehensive plan whereby He ordains all things in His universe? And, again, because the one is true we have seen that the other most biblically and logically follows.</p>
<p>
As this plan projects the creation of a spiritual and material universe has He taken that next step and objectified His omnipotence, omniscience, and omnibenevolence by actually bringing into existence a realm of reality apart from Himself? Once more we must answer, <i><b>Yes</b></i>, for <dr class='alt5'>“The heavens declare the glory of God; the firmament proclaims the work of His hands” (Psa. 19:1).</dr class='alt5'></p>
<h3>
Sovereign control? 
</h3>
<p>
The question we must now face, then, is does this Sovereign God who planned so carefully and created so beautifully yet maintain sovereign control in His universe? Is He a provident God “who stays to preserve and to renew and finally to consummate His purposive creation"? David has answered this question for us with the eloquence of a worshipping heart as he says
<dr class='alt5'>Yours, O Lord, is the greatness, The power and the glory, The victory and the majesty; For all that is in heaven and in earth is Yours; Yours is the kingdom, O Lord, And You are exalted as head over all. Both riches and honour come from You, And You reign over all.
In Your hand is power and might; In Your hand it is to make great And to give strength to all. (1 Chron 29:11-12)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
With a series of majestic nouns David acknowledges, rather than ascribes, Yahweh's greatness, power, glory, victory, majesty, dominion, headship and might; with a series of majestic verbs, in acknowledgement of this greatness, he forcefully indicates the acts of Yahweh who exalts, rules, makes great and strengthens. He is thus described not as possessing mere raw power but infinitely creative power; not only as the victorious conqueror, but also as the benevolent ruler; not only as surrounded by intrinsic glory but also as the provident Lord; not merely as being essentially great in Himself but as the gracious enabler who makes great.</p>
<h3>
The Doctrine of Providence 
</h3>
<p>
The doctrine of providence affirms what David testifies in his prayer nearly three millennia ago. The living God everywhere upholds and maintains the created universe and He does so, moreover, for the sovereign purpose and goal for which He initially created it.  Because of our tendency to be parochial and certainly because of our finiteness and our fallenness we have a very myopic view of reality.</p>
<p>
This doctrine enables us to see things in correct perspective. It tells us that<br> “… despite sin’s colossal disfigurement of the universe through creaturely revolt, God affirms the universe more than He negates it; His program is one of redemption not demolition, one of preservation not of destruction, one of renewal and not of obliteration.” <br>
Furthermore, this truth has immediate and salutary bearing on our Christian lives. “It means that we are able to live in the assurance that God is present and active in our lives. We are in His care and can therefore face the future confidently, knowing that things are not happening merely by chance. We can pray, knowing that God hears and acts upon our prayers. We can face danger, knowing that He is not unaware and uninvolved." </p>
<h3>
Trusting in God's Providence
</h3>
<p>
In the midst of, because of and despite seemingly impossible pressure and overwhelming circumstances, “God's majestic providence encourages us not only to believe and trust but also to praise Him. God who has already predestined and called His people to salvation continues to work out His purpose amid their seemingly contradictory and perplexing circumstances on the way to glory (Rom. 8:28 ff).” As Paul states later in the same chapter, <dr class='alt5'>“He who did not spare His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?" (Rom. 8:32).</dr class='alt5'><br> God will not create; God will not redeem; only to leave us on our own. The "not" of verse 32 was carefully chosen by the apostle so as to call forth a positive answer to his question. Surely, He will give us all things freely.</p>
