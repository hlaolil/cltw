<h1>
Holy Spirit in the Old Testament
</h1>
<h2>
The role of the Holy Spirit
</h2>
The role of the Holy Spirit in the Old 

Testament was much like His role in the 

New Testament.  These areas of the Holy 

Spirit’s work is as evident in the Old 

Testament as it is in the New Testament. 

When we speak of the role of the Holy 

Spirit, we can discern five general areas 

in which the Holy Spirit still works now.
</p> 
<h2>
Regeneration
</h2>
<p>
The first area of the Spirit’s work is in the 

process of regeneration. Another word for 

regeneration is “rebirth,” from which we 

get the concept of being “born again.” The 

classic proof text for this can be found in 

John’s gospel:<dr class='alt5'> <br>“Most assuredly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.” (John 3:3).</dr class='alt5'><br> This begs the 

question: what does this have to do with 

the Holy Spirit’s work in the Old 

Testament? Later on in His dialogue with 

Nicodemus, <dr class='alt5'>Jesus answered and said to him, “Are you the teacher of Israel, and do not know these things?” (John 3:10).</dr class='alt5'> 

The point Jesus was making is that 

Nicodemus should have known the truth 

that the Holy Spirit is the source of new 

life because it is revealed in the Old 

Testament. For instance, Moses told the 

Israelites prior to entering the Promised 

Land that <dr class='alt5'>“And the Lord your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants, to love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, that you may live". (Deuteronomy 30:6).</dr class='alt5'> <br>This 

circumcision of the heart is the work of 

God’s Spirit and can be accomplished 

only by Him. We also see the theme of 

regeneration in Ezekiel 11:19-20 and 

Ezekiel 36:26-29.
</p>
<p>
The fruit of the Spirit’s regenerating work 

is faith (Ephesians 2:8). Now we know 

that there were men of faith in the Old 

Testament because Hebrews 11 names 

many of them. If faith is produced by the 

regenerating power of the Holy Spirit, then 

this must be the case for Old Testament 

saints who looked ahead to the cross, 

believing that what God had promised in 

regard to their redemption would come to 

pass. They saw the promises and <dr class='alt5'>

“having seen them afar off were assured of them” 

(Hebrews 11:13)</dr class='alt5'>, accepting by faith that 

what God had promised, He would also 

bring to pass.
</p>
<h2>
Indwelling (or filling)
</h2>
<p>
The second aspect of the Spirit’s work in 

the Old Testament is indwelling, or filling. 

Here is where the major difference 

between the Spirit’s roles in the Old and 

New Testaments is apparent. The New 

Testament teaches the permanent 

indwelling of the Holy Spirit in believers (1 

Corinthians 3:16-17; 6:19-20). When we 

place our faith in Christ for salvation, the 

Holy Spirit comes to live within us. The 

Apostle Paul calls this permanent 

indwelling the <dr class='alt5'>“guarantee of our 

inheritance” (Ephesians 1:13-14)</dr class='alt5'>.<br> In 

contrast to this work in the New 

Testament, the indwelling in the Old 

Testament was selective and temporary. 

The Spirit “came upon” such Old 

Testament people as Joshua (Numbers 

27:18), David (1 Samuel 16:12-13) and 

even Saul (1 Samuel 10:10). In the book 

of Judges, we see the Spirit “coming 

upon” the various judges whom God 

raised up to deliver Israel from their 

oppressors. The Holy Spirit came upon 

these individuals for specific tasks. The 

indwelling was a sign of God’s favour 

upon that individual (in the case of David), 

and if God’s favour left an individual, the 

Spirit would depart (e.g., in Saul’s case in 

1 Samuel 16:14). Finally, the Spirit 

“coming upon” an individual doesn’t 

always indicate that person’s spiritual 

condition (e.g., Saul, Samson, and many 

of the judges). So, while in the New 

Testament the Spirit only indwells 

believers and that indwelling is 

permanent, the Spirit came upon certain 

Old Testament individuals for a specific 

task, irrespective of their spiritual 

condition. Once the task was completed, 

the Spirit presumably departed from that 

person.
</p>
<h2>
Restraint
</h2>
<p>
The third aspect of the Spirit’s work in the 

Old Testament is His restraint of sin. 

Genesis 6:3 would seem to indicate that 

the Holy Spirit restrains man’s sinfulness, 

and that restraint can be removed when 

God’s patience regarding sin reaches a 

"boiling point." This thought is echoed in 2 

Thessalonians 2:3-8, when in the end 

times a growing apostasy will signal the 

coming of God’s judgement. Until the 

preordained time when the <dr class='alt5'>“man of 

sin” (2 Thes 2:3)</dr class='alt5'> will be revealed, the 

Holy Spirit restrains the power of Satan 

and will release it only when it suits His 

purposes to do so.
</p>
<h2>
Empowerment for service.
</h2>
<p>
The fourth aspect of the Spirit’s work in 

the Old Testament is the granting of 

ability for service. Much like the way the 

spiritual gifts operate in the New 

Testament, the Spirit would gift certain 

individuals for service. Consider the 

example of Bezalel in Exodus 31:2-5 who 

was gifted to do much of the artwork 

relating to the Tabernacle. Furthermore, 

recalling the selective and temporary 

indwelling of the Holy Spirit discussed 

above, we see that these individuals were 

gifted to perform certain tasks, such as 

ruling over the people of Israel (e.g., Saul 

and David).
</p>
<h2>
The Spirit’s role in creation.
</h2>
<p> 
Genesis 1:2 speaks of the Spirit <dr class='alt5'>“hovering 

over the waters”</dr class='alt5'> and superintending the 

work of creation. In a similar fashion, the 

Spirit is responsible for the work of the 

new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17) as He 

is bringing people into the kingdom of God 

through regeneration.
</p>
<p>
All in all, the Spirit performed much of the 

same functions in Old Testament times 

as He does in this current age. The major 

difference is the permanent indwelling of 

the Spirit in believers now.<br> As Jesus said 

regarding this change in the Spirit’s 

ministry,<dr class='alt5'> “the Spirit of truth, whom the 

world cannot receive, because it neither 

sees Him nor knows Him; but you know 

Him, for He dwells with you and will be in 

you.” (John 14:17)</dr class='alt5'>.
