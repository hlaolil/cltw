 	<h1>Who Is the Angel of the Lord </h1>
<p>
If Gideon only saw an angel, why did he fear that he might die? Many interpreters believe that an angel takes God's place and acts as His representative. However, others do not feel this explanation fits all the data. Who, then, is this "angel of the Lord"?</p>
<p>
The angel of the Lord first appears in Gen 16:7 and then intermittently throughout the early Old Testament books. In other passages an individual manifesting himself in human form is frequently called "the Lord" (Gen 12:7; 17:1; 18:1). If this angel actually were God, why is he called an angel? Since the root meaning of angel is "messenger" or "one who is sent," we must determine from context whether the word refers to the office of the sent one or to the nature of created angels as finite beings.</p>
<p>
Initially, some contexts of the term "angel of the Lord" appear to refer to nothing more than any other angel (as in Judg 6:11). But as the narrative progresses, that angel soon transcends the angelic category and is described in terms suited only to a member of the Trinity. Thus in the Judges 6 episode, we are startled when verse 14 has the Lord speaking to Gideon, when previously only the angel of the Lord had been talking.</p>
<p>
Many Old Testament passages state that this angel is God.<br> After being told that Hagar had been speaking with the angel of the Lord. <br>(four times in Gen 16:7, 9-11), Gen 16:13 informs us that Hagar <dr class='alt5'> "called the name of the Lord who spoke to her, "You-Are-the-God-Who-Sees;"</class='alt5'>  
<p>Jacob's testimony in Gen 48:15-16 is even more striking. He identifies the God in whose presence his fathers Abraham and Isaac had lived as <dr class='alt5'>"The God who has fed me all my life long to this day, The Angel who has redeemed me from all evil,"</p>
