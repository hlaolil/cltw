Tools of discipleship <br> Spirit and Word 
</h1>
<p>
When Jesus took His leave of those first eleven 

remaining disciples, nearing the end of the first part of 

their apprenticeship, He said to them,<dr class='alt5'> "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.” <br>(Matt 28:18-20)</dr class='alt5'><br>
Except He didn’t quite say always, He said, "I am with 

you all of the days." Jesus promises to be with them 

every day. That’s weird, isn’t it, as we said, and just 

as He takes His leave. How can this be? <br>It’s John 

who explains it best. <dr class='alt5'>"... when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, “Peace be with you.” When He had said this, He showed them His hands and His side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. So Jesus said to them again, “Peace to you! As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.” And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit". (John 20:19-22)<dr class='alt5'>
</p>
 <p>
And in that instant, all Jesus' previous teaching must 

have become clear, all that stuff about a Spirit of 

truth, an advocate who will come to them, one who 

will take what is Jesus' and declare it to them, one 

who will turn their pain to joy, who will make it 

possible for them to ask anything in the name of 

Jesus and receive it. He is one who will be the sap in 

the vine of which they are a part.
</p> 
<p> 
And here is the key to our discipleship. Jesus can 

lead you to a group of people with whom you can 

begin a new journey. You will begin to realise you are 

able talk to God in prayer. And through the prayer you 

will be overwhelmed by the cleansing, renewing 

presence of the Holy Spirit. And this will definitely 

change you! 
</p>
<p>
The key ingredient to our discipleship is the Holy 

Spirit. We cannot follow Jesus without the Holy Spirit, 

because Jesus is, clearly, not here. No puzzling 

conversations about fasting or Sabbaths, no master 

classes in casting out particularly resistant evil spirits, 

no incomprehensible trips up mountains or nights 

spent in gardens, no surreal stories, no disappearing 

and reappearing tricks. None of that is available to us. 

What is 
available to us we now find within ourselves, in the 

person of the Holy Spirit. 
</p>
<p>
If discipleship is anything, it has to be Trinitarian, 

linking us to Father, Son and Spirit
