 	<h1>A Personal God</h1>
<p>
<h2>Old Testament Evidence</h2>
<p>
These promises of the New Testament build on a considerable Old Testament backdrop of evidence for a personal God. It cannot be over stressed that it is fundamental to appreciate the nature of God if we are to have any true understanding of what Bible based religion is all about. The Old Testament consistently talks of God as a person; the person-to-person relationship with God of which both Old and New Testaments speak is unique to the true Christian hope.</p>
<h3>
In the image of God
</h3>
<p> 
The following are strong arguments in favour of a personal God:<br>
<dr class='alt5'>Then God said, “Let Us make man in Our image, according to Our likeness”.(Gen. 1:26)  </dr class='alt5'>Thus man is made in the image and likeness of God, as manifested through the angels. <br>James speaks of <dr class='alt5'>“... men, which are made in the similitude of God.” James 3:9</dr class='alt5'> Our creation in the image of God surely means that we can infer something about the real object of which we are but an image. Thus God, whom we reflect, is not something nebulous of which we cannot conceive.</br> Ezekiel saw God enthroned above the cherubim, with the silhouette of <dr class='alt5'>“the likeness of a man” (Ezek. 1:26; 10:20)</dr class='alt5'>; it is God Himself who is located above the cherubim (2 Kings 19:15). <br>All this has a practical import; because we are in the image of God, because it is imprinted on every part of our bodies,<dr class='alt5'> “Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s, and to God the things that are God’s.” (Luke 20:25)</dr class='alt5'><br>God is a person and He has a definite form and being.</p>
<h3>
God's Dwelling Place </h3>
<p>He wishes us to conceive of Him as a personal being, a Father to whom we can relate.
Descriptions of God’s dwelling place clearly indicate that He has a personal location:<br><dr class='alt5'> “God is in heaven” (Eccl. 5:2)</dr class='alt5'> <br><dr class='alt5'>“He has looked down from the height of His sanctuary; from heaven did the Lord behold the earth” (Psa. 102:19,20)</dr class='alt5'> <br><dr class='alt5'>“Hear in heaven your dwelling place” (1 Kings 8:39)</dr class='alt5'> </p>
<p>
Yet more specifically than this, we read that God has a “throne” (2 Chron. 9:8; Psa. 11:4; Is. 6:1; 66:1). Such language is hard to apply to an undefined essence which exists somewhere in heavenly realms. God is spoken of as “coming down” when He manifests Himself. This suggests a heavenly location of God. It is impossible to understand the idea of God's manifestation without appreciating the personal nature of God.
</p>
<p>
Is. 45 is full of references by God to His personal involvement in the affairs of His people:<br> <dr class='alt5'>“I am the Lord, and there is none else ... I the Lord do all these things ... I the Lord have created it. Woe unto him that strives with his maker...I, even my hands have stretched out the heavens ... look unto me, and be saved, all the ends of the earth”</dr class='alt5'> <br>
This last sentence especially shows the personal existence of God - He desires men to look to Him, to conceive of His literal existence with the eye of faith.
</p>
<p>
God is revealed to us as a forgiving God, who speaks words to men. Yet forgiveness and speech can only come from a sentient being, they are mental acts. Thus David was a man after God’s own heart (1 Sam. 13:14), showing that God has a mind (heart), which is capable of being replicated to some limited degree by man, although man by nature is not after God’s heart. Passages like, <dr class='alt5'>“And the Lord was sorry that He had made man on the earth, and He was grieved in His heart.” (Gen. 6:6)</dr class='alt5'> reveal God as a feeling, conscious being. This helps us to appreciate how we really can both please and displease Him, as children can a natural father.</li></p>
<p>
<h2>Is God Personal ...</h2>
<h3>
If He isn't
</h3>
<p>
If God is not a real, personal being, then the concept of spirituality is hard to grapple with. If God is totally righteous but is not a personal being, then we cannot really conceive of His righteousness manifested in human beings. Once we appreciate that there is a personal being called God, then we can work on our characters, with His help and the influence of His word, to reflect the characteristics of God in our lives.</p>
<h3>
God Is Personal
</h3>
<p>
God’s purpose is to reveal Himself in a multitude of glorified beings. His memorial name, Yahweh Elohim, implies this ("He who shall be revealed in mighty ones", is an approximate translation). The descriptions of the reward of the faithful in God’s coming Kingdom on earth show that they will have a tangible, bodily existence, although no longer subject to the weaknesses of human nature.<br> 
Job longed for the <dr class='alt5'>“latter day”</dr class='alt5'> when he would have a resurrection of his body (Job 19:25-27). <br>
Abraham is one of the <dr class='alt5'>“many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake,Some to everlasting life,” (Dan. 12:2)</dr class='alt5'> so that he can receive the promise of eternal inheritance of the land of Canaan, a physical location on this earth (Gen. 17:8).<br> <dr class='alt5'>“Saints shall shout aloud for joy...let them sing aloud on their beds...and  execute vengeance on the nations, And punishments on the peoples” <br>(Psa. 132:16; 149:5,7)</dr class='alt5'> <br>
A failure by both Jew and Gentile to appreciate passages like these, as well as the fundamentally literal, physical import of the promises to Abraham, has led to the wrong notion of an “immortal soul” as the real form of human existence. Such an idea is totally devoid of Biblical support. God is an immortal, glorious being, and He is working out His purpose so that men and women might be called to live in His future Kingdom on this earth, to share His attributes, expressed in a bodily form.</p>
<p>
The faithful are promised that <dr class='alt5'>"... you may be partakers of the divine nature ..."(2 Pet. 1:4)</dr class='alt5'> <br>
will transform our lowly body that <dr class='alt5'>"... it may be conformed to His glorious body (Phil. 3:21)</dr class='alt5'> and we know that He will have a physical body in the Kingdom. The doctrine of the personality of God is therefore related to the Gospel of the Kingdom.</p>
<p>
There can be no sensible concept of worship, religion or personal relationship with God therefore until it is appreciated that God is a real being and that we are made in His image. We need to develop His mental likeness now so that we may be made fully like Him in the Kingdom of God. So much more sense and comfort can now be gained from the passages which speak of God as a loving Father, chastening us as a Father does his son (e.g. Deut. 8:5).<br> 
In the context of Christ’s sufferings we read that,<dr class='alt5'> “Yet it pleased the Lord to bruise Him” (Is. 53:10)</dr class='alt5'> although he <dr class='alt5'>“cried out to my God; He heard my voice from His temple, And my cry came before Him, even to His ears.” (Psa. 18:6)</dr class='alt5'> <br>
God’s promise to David of a seed who would be God’s Son required the miraculous birth of a human being who was truly in the image and likeness of His father.</p>
<p>
A correct understanding of God is a key which opens up many other vital areas of Bible doctrine. But as one lie leads to another lie, so a false concept of God obscures the truth which the Scriptures offer. If you have found this section convincing, or even partly so, the question arises: "Do you really know God?" We will now further explore Bible teaching about Him.</p>
<p>
<h2>The Unity Of God</h2>
<p>
There is really repeated Biblical emphasis upon the unity of God, that Yahweh God of Israel,<dr class='alt5'> "the Father"</dr class='alt5'> is the one and only God:<dr class='alt5'> "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one!" (Deut. 6:4).</dr class='alt5'> He swears that there will be no God formed after Him <dr class='alt5'>Before Me there was no God formed, nor shall there be after Me.(Isa 43:10)</dr class='alt5'> </p>
<p>
The birth and exaltation of His Son, whatever exalted language is used about, was therefore in no way the forming of another God. If the Lord Jesus knew there to have been a trinity, it's somewhat strange that He fails to correct the man who commented: <dr class='alt5'>"Teacher. You have spoken the truth, for there is one God, and there is no other but He." (Mark. 12:32)</dr class='alt5'> The record presents an obviously monotheistic Jewish scribe as being in complete agreement with the Lord Jesus about the unity of God. The Lord Jesus evidently supported the Old Testament's strict monotheism.</p>
