   <h1>The God Who Reveals Himself</h1>
<p>
People have all kinds of distorted impressions of God. As a result, their view of life is awry- for 

example, they may think life is just a matter of fate. But the Lord of the universe leaves nothing to 

chance.</p>
<h3>
What God is
</h3>
<p>
Because God wants us to approach life correctly, His Word gives us a clear picture of what He 

is like. One way He reveals Himself is through the material world. The Bible says that the 

heavens "declare the glory of God" and "pour forth speech" about the Author of creation (Ps. 

19:1-2 niv). They are telling of His strength and magnificence. Likewise, the wind, waves, and 

natural disasters show forth the power of our awesome God. And in a similar way, all the cycles 

of nature, with their vivid colours and changing patterns, tell of our Maker's creative genius.</p>
<p>
<h3>
Man's conscience
</h3>
<p>
Another way God chooses to reveal Himself is through man's conscience. Even people who 

have never heard of God's laws instinctively know what is right and what is wrong (Rom. 

2:11-15). There are atheists who would never lie, steal, or kill. This standard comes from God, 

who has impressed a moral sense on every person's conscience.</p>
<p>
Many people obey their conscience yet fail to believe in God or recognise that they are 

accountable to Him. The fact is that unbelief doesn't cancel your accountability to the Lord. The 

evidence for His existence is undeniable, but He will not force anyone to believe. Everybody has 

a choice to make: Will I worship a god of my own creation, or will I worship the One who created me?
