Preservation by God
</h1>
<p>
Preservation means that all things owe their continued existence to God's omnipotent and omnipresent power. Every creature is sustained continuously in harmony with its own peculiar being and nature. This applies to all creatures. 
</p>
<p>
It also applies to all moral rational creatures, including the evil as well as the good, the powers of darkness as well as the kingdom of our God, in Jesus Christ our Lord. This element of the providence of God is known as cooperation. 
</p>
<p>
In a general sense,preservation is God's continuously sustaining power as it causes all creation to continue to exist. Every creature is sustained by God according to its nature, the tree as tree, the animal as animal, the plant as plant, etc. The Lord never violates or annuls the nature of any particular creature. This is certainly emphasised throughout in the Word of God. Nothing happens by chance. There is no such thing as "luck." And we should be careful never to include this word "luck" in our vocabulary. 
</p>
<p>
The Bible speaks of the hairs of our head as all being numbered, that we cannot make one hair white or black, that not a sparrow falls off the housetop without the will of our heavenly Father, and that He gives to every lily of the field its beauty and bestows upon it a glory that Solomon never knew. Indeed, there is no truth of which we are surer and which we live and practice as little as this truth of the Lord's continuous preservation. 
</p>
<p>
We say that it was providential of God when we missed a train or plane that subsequently suffers disaster, and we often fail to understand that it would have been just as providential had we boarded that particular train or plane which would have resulted in our death. And these examples can be multiplied. However, the confessions and the infallible Scriptures ascribe all things to God's providence, and this includes adversity as well as prosperity, sickness as well as health, death as well as life, the "bad and evil" as well as the "good." 
</p>
<p>
Nothing happens by chance, but all things occur according to and by the Lord's constantly providential care over all things. This is what we mean when we speak of God's providence from the viewpoint of preservation. In subsequent articles we will call attention, the Lord willing, to this providence of the Lord as consisting of government and cooperation. The former refers to God's control over all things as the Lord guides all things to His own determinate end, and the latter refers to all the acts of His moral-rational creatures as always under the direct control of the living God.
