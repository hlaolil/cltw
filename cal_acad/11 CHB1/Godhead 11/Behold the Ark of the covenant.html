<h1>
Behold the Ark of the covenant 
</h1>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>
 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is crossing over before you into the Jordan. (Joshua 3:11)</dr class='alt5'></p>
<h3>
The Lord goes ahead
</h3>
<p>
The ark is on the shoulders of a delegation of spiritual leaders and when they step into the river the amazing happens: 20 miles up river, the water stands up, and the riverbed empties as the water rushes by to the Dead Sea. Then the people of Israel walk over this wide swath of dry ground where moments ago a river ran 10 feet deep! God was first in, and He went into the place of the most danger. As pictured by the Ark, He’s first, He’s in the middle, and He’s the last out. He leads and has us covered … always!
</p>
<p>
First Joshua says that the ark of God will go before; and secondly, he explains for what purpose, namely, that the Jordan river may retreat, trembling, so to speak, at the presence of the Lord, as is said in the Psalms. (Psalm 114.)</p> 
<h3>
God is Ruler
</h3>
<p>
Let us understand, that while the ark went before, God displayed His power in guiding the people. And in this way there was a confirmation of the sanctity of the worship appointed by the Law, when the Israelites perceived that it was no empty symbol of His presence that God had deposited with them. For Jordan was compelled to yield obedience to God just as if it had beheld His majesty.</p>
<p>
We must remember, that the only reason which induced the Lord to display His grace in the ark was because He had placed His covenant within it. Moreover, as this could not be easily credited, Joshua directs the mind of the people to the contemplation of the divine power, which surmounts all difficulties. The title of <dr class='alt3'>  Ruler of the whole earth</dr class='alt3'>  here applied to God is not insignificant, but extols His power above all the elements of nature, in order that the Israelites, considering how seas and rivers are subject to His dominion, might have no doubt that the waters, though naturally liquid, would become stable in obedience to His word.</p>
