 	<h1>God's Preservation</h1>
<p>
The Bible states: the Son, through whom also He made the worlds;<br> <dr class='alt5'>who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person, and upholding all things by the word of His power. (Heb 1:3).</dr class='alt5'><br> Not only do we see He is God who created all things but that He is the one who sustains all things through His Word. 
A better rendering of the Word sustaining is upholding because Jesus doesn’t merely sustain all things. but He actually upholds all things.</p>
<h3>
Upholding and Preserving
</h3> 
<p>
Jesus is upholding all things in the power of His word which is an ongoing activity and purposeful. He is involved in upholding all things. its not the case that God has just wound the world up like a clock and left it to its own mechanisms (natural laws that we observe around us all of which God has set in place) but He is actively and purposefully upholding all things even the natural laws we see around us.</p>
<p>
In the book of Colossians is further confirmation:<br> <dr class='alt5'> And He is before all things, and in Him all things consist.(Colossians 1:17)</dr class='alt5'><br> Again we see He is the one who created all things (every created thing in the universe), the One who holds everything together, He maintains it all, and He preserves it all and in Him they exist.This means if God was to cease sustaining all things, or to hold them together, the only thing that would exist would be God. We would no longer exist as the Apostle Paul said in Acts:<br> <dr class='alt5'> in Him we live and move and have our being. (Acts: 17:28)</p> 
<p>
We see the the Levites Declare:<br> <dr class='alt5'> "You alone are the Lord; You have made heaven, The heaven of heavens, with all their host, The earth and everything on it, The seas and all that is in them, And You preserve them all. The host of heaven worships You. (Nehemiah 9:6)</p>
