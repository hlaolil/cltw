  <h1>
Quenching - Grieving the Holy Spirit
</h1>
<h3>
Quenching  the Holy Spirit
</h3>
<p>
When the word “quench” is used in 

Scripture, it is speaking of suppressing 

fire. When believers put on the shield of 

faith, as part of their armour of God 

(Ephesians 6:16), they are extinguishing 

the power of the fiery darts from Satan. 

Christ described hell as a place where 

the fire would not be “quenched” (Mark 

9:44, 46, 48). Likewise, the Holy Spirit is a 

fire dwelling in each believer. He wants to 

express Himself in our actions and 

attitudes. When believers do not allow the 

Spirit to be seen in our actions, when we 

do what we know is wrong, we suppress 

or quench the Spirit (1 Thessalonians 

5:19). We do not allow the Spirit to reveal 

Himself the way that He wants to.
</p>
<h3>
Grieving the Holy Spirit
</h3>
<p>
To understand what it means to 

grieve (cause sadness or sorrow to) the 

Spirit, we must first understand that this 

indicates the Spirit possesses 

personality. Only a person can be 

grieved; therefore, the Spirit must be a 

divine person in order to have this 

emotion. Once we understand this, we 

can better understand how He is grieved, 

mainly because we too are grieved. 

Ephesians 4:30 tells us that we should 

not grieve the Spirit.<p> We will grieve the Spirit:
<ul> 
<li>
by living like the pagans (4:17-19), 
 </li>
 <li>
 by lying (4:25),
</li>
<li> 
 by being angry (4:26-27), 
</li> 
<li>
by stealing (4:28), 
</li> 
<li>
by cursing (4:29), 
</li> 
<li>
by being bitter (4:31),
</li> 
<li>
by being unforgiving (4:32), 
</li> 
<li>
and by being sexually immoral (5:3-5). 
</ul> 
</li>
<p>
To grieve the Spirit is to act out in a sinful 

manner, whether it is in thought only or in 

both thought and deed.
</p>
<p class='block'>
Both quenching and grieving the Spirit are 

similar in their effects. Both hinder a godly 

lifestyle. Both happen when a believer 

sins against God and follows his or her 

own worldly desires. The only correct 

road to follow is the road that leads the 

believer closer to God and purity, and 

farther away from the world and sin. Just 

as we do not like to be grieved, and just 

as we do not seek to quench what is 

good—so we should not grieve or quench 

the Holy Spirit by refusing to follow His 

leading.
