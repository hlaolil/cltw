   <h1>
Who is the Holy Spirit
</h1>
<h2>
The Personality of the Holy Spirit 
</h2>
<h3>
First:
</h3>
<p>
In Acts 13:1-5, the Holy Spirit acts as a Person. He speaks to the leaders of the church at Antioch. He instructs them, <dr class='alt5'>"Now separate to Me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them" (v. 2).</dr class='alt5'> Notice the personal references "to Me" and "I." The Holy Spirit, along with the Antioch leaders, sends out the missionaries (vv. 3, 4).</p>
<h3>
Second:
</h3>
<p>
Throughout the rest of the Book of Acts, the Holy Spirit is portrayed as a Person. He had inspired Scripture which had to be fulfilled (1:16). Ananias lies to the Holy Spirit (5:3). The Spirit bears witness to Jesus (5:32). Philip is instructed by the Spirit (8:28). The early believers are comforted by Him (9:31).</p>
<p>
The Spirit tells Peter how to act towards the men He has sent (10:19f). Peter recounts to Cornelius what the Spirit had told Him (11:12). The decisions of the Jerusalem council are confirmed by the Holy Spirit (15:28).
</p>
<p>
The Holy Spirit forbids Paul to preach in Asia and Bithynai (16:6f). He testifies about the <dr class='alt5'>"chains and tribulations"</dr class='alt5'> awaiting Paul (20:23).<br> Paul tells the elders of the church at Ephesus,<dr class='alt5'> ". . . the Holy Spirit has made you overseers to shepherd the church of God . . ."  (20:28).</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
The Holy Spirit again prophesies of the problems about to befall Paul (21:11). And finally, Paul declares, <dr class='alt5'>"The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers . . ." (28:25).</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>
Third:
</h3>
<p>
The Holy Spirit exhibits personal traits elsewhere in the Bible. The Spirit  <dr class='alt5'>"hovers" </dr class='alt5'> over the creation (Hebrew--rahap Gen 1:2, compare Deut 32:11). <br>He is to send Israel's Redeemer (Isa 48:16).
</p>
<p>
Jesus promises His followers that the Spirit will speak for them when they are being persecuted (Matt 10:16-20). The Spirit will teach them what they should say (Luke 12:12).
</p>
<p>
The Spirit assures believers we are the children of God. He leads us, bears witness to us, and enables us to cry out <dr class='alt5'>"Abba, Father" (Rom 8:14-17).</dr class='alt5'> He intercedes for us before the Father (Rom 8:26). He also loves us and enables us to love God and others (Rom 5:5, 15:30).
</p>
<p>
The Spirit searches <dr class='alt5'>"the deep things of God"</dr class='alt5'> and knows them (1Cor 2:10f). He distributes spiritual gifts to all Christians <dr class='alt5'>"as He wills" (1Cor 12:11).</dr class='alt5'> And we can have <dr class='alt5'>"communion"</dr class='alt5'> or <dr class='alt5'>"fellowship"</dr class='alt5'> with the Holy Spirit (2Cor 13:14; Gr. koinonia).
</p>
<p>
Further, we can grieve the Holy Spirit (Eph 4:30). He instructs us as to what will happen <dr class='alt5'>"in the latter times" (I Tim 4:1).</dr class='alt5'> He witnesses to believers as to the perfection of the sacrifice of Jesus (Heb 10:14-17). He is insulted when people reject what Christ has done (Heb 10:29). As such, the Spirit commands people to accept the free offer of eternal life (Rev 22:17).
</p>
<h3>
Fourth:
</h3>
<p>
Masculine pronouns are used in reference to the Holy Spirit despite the fact that "Spirit" (Greek--pneuma) is neuter (John 14:26; 15:26; 16:8, 13f, Greek--ekeinos, literally, that One).
</p>
<h3>
Fifth:
</h3>
<p>
Jesus referred to the Holy Spirit as <dr class='alt5'>"another Helper" (John 14: 16).</dr class='alt5'> "Another" in the Greek is allos. Greek scholar Joseph Thayer states, "Allos generally denotes simply a distinction of individuals." This usage is in contrast to a similar word Jesus could have spoken but did not--heteros (different). "Heteros involves the secondary idea of difference of kind" (Thayer, p. 243). Hence, since Jesus is a Person, the Holy Spirit must be One also.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the word rendered <dr class='alt5'>"Helper"</dr class='alt5'> (Greek--parakletos) is applied to Jesus in I John 2:1 where it is generally translated as <dr class='alt5'>"Advocate."</dr class='alt5'> Thayer writes in reference to both Jesus and the Holy Spirit being called parakletos," so of the Holy Spirit destined to take the place of Christ with the apostles (after His ascension) . . ." (Thayer, p. 483). Only a Person can take the place of a Person.
</p>
<p>
See Acts 9:31 where the early church is said to be <dr class='alt5'>". . . walking in the fear of the Lord and the comfort of the Holy Spirit."</dr class='alt5'> "Comfort" is the verb form of the noun parakletos (i.e.. parakleses).
</p>
<h2>
 The Deity of the Holy Spirit
</h2>
<h3>
First:
</h3>
<p>
The Holy Spirit is equated with God in several places in the Scriptures. Peter considers lying to the Holy Spirit to be the same as lying to God (Acts 5:3f). <br>Paul calls the Spirit <dr class='alt5'>"the Lord" (2Cor 3:17).</dr class='alt5'> 
</p>
<p>
The Spirit distributes gifts to Christians <dr class='alt5'>"as He wills" (1Cor 12:11).</dr class='alt5'><br> But it is God who sets members in the Church<dr class='alt5'> "as He pleases" (1Cor 12:18).</dr class='alt5'><br> In addition, the Lord directs our <dr class='alt5'>"hearts into the love of God" (2Thes 3:5).</dr class='alt5'> <br>Yet,<dr class='alt5'> "the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit" <br>(Rom 5:5).</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>
Second:
</h3>
<p>
Christians are the temple of God because the Spirit dwells in us (1Cor 3:16). Further, Paul prays for Christians to <dr class='alt5'>"be filled with all the fullness of God"<br> (Eph 3:19).</dr class='alt5'> <br>But later, he commands us to <dr class='alt5'>"be filled with the Spirit" (Eph 5:18).</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>
Third:
</h3>
<p>
The Holy Spirit possesses the attributes of God. He is eternal (Heb 9:14), omnipresent (Psa 139:7-10), and omnipotent (Luke 1:35-37).<br> He knows <dr class='alt5'>"the deep things of God"</dr class='alt5'> so He must also be omniscient (1Cor 2:10f).
</p>
<h3>
Fourth:
</h3>
<p>
The Holy Spirit does the works of God. Genesis states,<dr class='alt5'> "the LORD God formed man" (2:7).</dr class='alt5'><br> But Job proclaimed,<dr class='alt5'> "The Spirit of God has made me . . ." (Job 33:4).</dr class='alt5'> <br>The Holy Spirit calls people to be missionaries and elders (Acts 13:2, 20:28). But Jesus tells us to pray for <dr class='alt5'>"the Lord of the harvest to send out labourers into His harvest" (Matt 9:38).</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
Peter states that the Scriptures were written as people <dr class='alt5'>"were moved by the Holy Spirit" (2 Pet 1:20f)</dr class='alt5'> <br>Paul informs us that <dr class='alt5'> "All Scripture is given by inspiration of God" (2 Tim 3:16). </dr class='alt5'> God gives The Revelation to Jesus, but it is the Spirit who is speaking to the churches (Rev 1:1; 2:7).
</p>
<p>
And most importantly, God gives eternal life, although people must be  <dr class='alt5'>"born of the Spirit" to be saved (1John 5:11; John 3:3-8). </dr class='alt5'><br> Further, God chooses us for salvation, and the Holy Spirit guarantees our inheritance (Eph 1:3-14).
</p>
<h3>
Fifth:
</h3>
<p>
The words of God are considered to be the words of the Holy Spirit. Compare the following sets of verses: Isa 6:9f; Acts 28:25-27; /Heb 10:15f; Jer 23,33f).
</p>
<h3>
Conclusion:
</h3>
<p>
In light of all of the preceding information, there is only one possible answer to the title of this article--the Holy Spirit is a Person who is God. As such, HE is able to give the believer comfort and direction in life. These things, a "force" could not possibly provide (see Rom 8:14; Acts 9:31).
