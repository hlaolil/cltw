 	<h1>God's Only Begotten Son</h1>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life." (John 3:16).</p>
<p>
One of the favourite Christmas Scripture verses is <dr class='alt5'>"In this the love of God was manifested toward us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him." (1 John 4:9)</dr class='alt5'> The marvellous incarnation in human flesh of the only begotten Son of God is not the end of the story, of course. The next verse explains that we have life through Him because God <dr class='alt5'>"sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins" (1 John 4:10).</dr class='alt5'> Our heavenly Father gives us eternal life instead of the eternal hell that we deserve because His only begotten Son died in our place for our sins. <dr class='alt5'>"For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him." (2 Corinthians 5:21).</p>
<p>
<h2>The Only Begotten of the Father</h2>
<p>
Consider, though, the significance of this revelation that Jesus Christ is the Father's "only begotten" Son. This unique phrase is used with reference to the Lord Jesus just four other times, and all five verses contain vitally important truths concerning Christ. These verses are as follows:
<dr class='alt5'>"And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth." (John 1:14).</dr class='alt5'>
This is the key verse of the Incarnation, assuring us that the man Jesus, who dwelt among us for a time, was also the eternal Word who was <dr class='alt5'>"in the beginning with God"</dr class='alt5'> and that He <dr class='alt5'>"was God" </dr class='alt5'>and that <dr class='alt5'>"all things were made by Him" (John 1:1-3).</dr class='alt5'><br> He was God the Creator manifest in the flesh.</p>
<p>
 <dr class='alt5'>"No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him." (John 1:18). </dr class='alt5'>
The Father is omnipresent, and therefore invisible to mortal eyes, but as Jesus said:  <dr class='alt5'>"He who has seen Me has seen the Father;" (John 14:9). </dr class='alt5'> Men have seen and heard the Father in the person of His only begotten Son. Whenever God has been seen by men, it has been through the Son who has revealed Him.
 <dr class='alt5'>"For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have everlasting life." (John 3:16). </dr class='alt5'>
<p>
This verse, of course, is the most magnificent of all gospel verses; many would call it the greatest verse in the Bible. It assures us that, if we simply put our trust in our great Creator who has become man in order to die for our sins, and then to defeat death and become our Saviour, our sins will be forgiven, and we shall live forever with Him.
 <dr class='alt5'>"He who believes in Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God." (John 3:18). </dr class='alt5'></p>
<p>
Other than the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,  <dr class='alt5'>"Nor is there salvation in any other, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved.”(Acts 4:12). </dr class='alt5'> In view of all that our Creator/Saviour has done for us, this verse gives clear warning that those who refuse or neglect to believe on the person and work of God's only begotten Son, will die in their sins, condemned forever by the Father whose Son they have spurned.
 <dr class='alt5'>"God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through Him" (1 John 4:9). </dr class='alt5'>
This great Christmas verse was discussed above and is a wonderful summary verse on salvation that Christians now often write on their Christmas cards.</p>
<p>
<h2>The Only Begotten Son</h2>
<p>
But why was it important for the Holy Spirit who inspired these five great verses to stress that the Lord Jesus was the incarnate only begotten Son of God? </dr class='alt5'> It is worth noting that, although Christ is called the Son, or Son of God, frequently in the New Testament, He is never (in the Greek original) called the "only" son of God.</p>
<p>
The fact is, that to call Him the only Son of God would make the Bible contradict itself, for He is not the only Son of God, and certainly not the  <dr class='alt5'>"one and only" </dr class='alt5'> Son of God. Angels are several times called the sons of God (e.g., Job 38:7) since they had no fathers, being directly created by God. Likewise, Adam was called the son of God (Luke 3:38), because he was directly created. The same applies even to fallen angels (Genesis 6:2), and even to Satan (Job 1:6), because they also were created beings. The term is also used in a spiritual sense, of course, for those who have become  <dr class='alt5'>"new creations" </dr class='alt5'> in Christ Jesus by faith (2 Corinthians 5:17; Ephesians 2:10; etc.). In this sense, we also are  <dr class='alt5'>"sons of God" (e.g., I John 3:2) </dr class='alt5'> by special creation not physically but spiritually.</p>
<p>
But it is never applied in this sense to Christ, for He is not a created son of God but a begotten Son of God--in fact, the only begotten Son of God.<dr class='alt5'> In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.(John 1:1).</dr class='alt5'> In His prayer to the Father in the upper room, He spoke of  <dr class='alt5'>"with the glory which I had with You before the world was." (John 17:5). </dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>
The only begotten Son from eternity
</h3>
<p>
In that wonderful Old Testament Christmas prophecy about His coming human birth in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2), we are told that His  <dr class='alt5'>"goings forth are from of old, from everlasting.” </dr class='alt5'> His human body was, indeed, Whose goings forth are from of old,
From everlasting.<dr class='alt5'>"brought forth" from "she who is in labour who has given birth;" (Micah 5:3).</dr class='alt5'> But long before that, He had been everlastingly going forth from <dr class='alt5'>"the bosom of the Father." John 1:18,<dr class='alt5'> He was still <dr class='alt5'>"in the bosom of the Father,"</dr class='alt5'> even while He was on Earth manifesting the Father.
These truths are beyond our full comprehension, of course, for they are all part of the great mystery of the Triune Godhead. Christ is <dr class='alt5'>"the image of the invisible God" (Colossians 1:15),</dr class='alt5'> for as He said: <dr class='alt5'>"I and my Father are one" (John 10:30).</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<h3>
Eternally Begotten
</h3>
<p>
He is not just the only begotten Son of the Father, for He is also the eternally begotten Son of the Father. He is eternally "in His bosom," yet always "going forth" to "declare" the Father--once as the creating Word, occasionally in pre-incarnate theophanies, also through the Holy Spirit conveying God's written Word (which had been <dr class='alt5'>"Forever, O Lord, Your word is settled in heaven." (Psalm 119:89)</dr class='alt5'> down to man through divinely chosen prophets, then ultimately appearing as the incarnate Word to live forever as the God/man.
The doctrine of "eternal generation" was what the older theologians called this great truth. He did not become the only Son by His virgin birth. He was the only begotten Son from eternity,<dr class='alt5'> "established from everlasting," (Proverbs 8:23)<dr class='alt5'>.</p>
<h3>
The First Begotten from the Dead
</h3>
<p>
But that is not all. He was not just the only begotten Son in the beginning, He soon also became the "the first born from the dead" in time (Revelation 1:5). He was <dr class='alt5'>"declared to be the Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead." (Romans 1:4).<dr class='alt5'> When Paul at Antioch preached on the resurrection, he declared that God <dr class='alt5'>"has raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, "You are My Son, Today I have begotten You" (Acts 13:33).</dr class='alt5'>
He is the only begotten Son eternally and now the first begotten Son by resurrection, <dr class='alt5'>"the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep" (I Corinthians 15:20).</dr class='alt5'> What a wonderful Saviour is Jesus Christ, our Lord!
The Lord Jesus is not only the unique Son of God by eternal generation and by resurrection, but also by divine inheritance. God has <dr class='alt5'>"spoken to us by His Son, whom He has appointed heir of all things" (Hebrews 1:2).</dr class='alt5'></p>
<h3>
The Uniquely Incarnate Son
</h3>
<p>
His unique human birth, miraculously conceived with a divinely created body in a virgin's womb, had also marked Him as the incarnate Son of God. To Mary, the angel had said: <dr class='alt5'>"Do not be afraid... that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God" (Luke 1:30,35).</dr class='alt5'>
His unique righteousness, in both character and action, still further marks Him as Son of God, for He alone possessed the divine nature from the beginning. He said on one occasion:<dr class='alt5'> "the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do; for whatever He does, the Son also does in like manner." (John 5:19).</dr class='alt5'>
He was even identified as God's Son by heavenly proclamation. <dr class='alt5'>Then a voice came from heaven, “You are My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” (Mark 1:11).</dr class='alt5'>
The Lord Jesus Christ is thus Son of God by miraculous conception and virgin birth, by heavenly proclamation, by His uniquely perfect human nature, by divine inheritance, and by triumphant resurrection.
But, most of all and first of all, He is Son of God by eternal generation--the Second Person of the Holy Trinity, the only begotten Son of God!</p>
<h3>
The Son Given
</h3>
<p>
There is another great Christmas verse. <dr class='alt5'>"For to us a child is born,"</dr class='alt5'> known and beloved by every born-again Christian. That child was the infant Jesus, born of the virgin as prophesied hundreds of years in advance (Isaiah 7:14) in the little town of Bethlehem, as also prophesied (Micah 5:2).<br> At the same time, <dr class='alt5'>"to us a Child is born,"</dr class='alt5'> That Son was the only begotten, eternally begotten Son of God. <dr class='alt5'>"And the government shall be upon His shoulder," for He holds the whole wide world in His hand! <dr class='alt5'>"And His name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace" (Isaiah 9:6).</p>
<p class='block'><i><dr class='alt1'>As one with the everlasting Father in the Triune Godhead, He is also the mighty God. He is our Creator, our Redeemer, our Resurrected Saviour, our King of kings and Lord of lords. <dr class='alt5'>"Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those who come to God through Him" (Hebrews 7:25).</dr class='alt5'></p>
