   <h1>
Joel’s Prophecy-The Pentecost
</h1>
<p>
In looking at what happened on the Day of 

Pentecost (Acts 2), we see the impact of 

that day was not only that the 120 

received the Baptism in the Holy Spirit 

and spoke with tongues, but that it was a 

day of the outpouring of the Gift of 

Prophecy. Over 800 years before that 

day, the Prophet Joel had prophesied that 

the Holy Spirit would be poured out, and 

the phenomena would be that both sons 

and daughters would prophesy (see Joel 

2:28-32). Joel had made no specific 

mention of speaking in tongues.
</p>
<h3>
Speaking in tongues
</h3>
<p>
Yet, when the Day of Pentecost came, 

those 120 did speak in tongues. The 

Scripture declares, <dr class='alt5'>“When the Day of 

Pentecost had fully come, they were all 

with one accord in one place. And 

suddenly there came a sound from 

heaven, as of a rushing mighty wind, and 

it filled the whole house where they were 

sitting. Then there appeared to them 

divided tongues, as of fire, and one sat 

upon each of them. And they were all 

filled with the Holy Spirit and began to 

speak with other tongues, as the Spirit 

gave them utterance.” (Acts 2:1-4).</dr class='alt5'> 
</p>
<p>
The noise they were making was such 

that a very large crowd gathered to see 

what it was all about. When that crowd 

gathered, maybe they came out of that 

upper room down on to the streets and 

began prophesying the words of the Lord 

Jesus? We are told that they were 

speaking in the languages of the different 

nationalities that were gathered there. The 

Holy Spirit so filled those disciples of 

Jesus that they were miraculously 

speaking in languages they had never 

learned – and those gathered could 

understand what they were saying. 
</p>
<h3>
Joel's Prophesy
</h3>
<p>
As the crowds were questioning what 

was happening, Peter stood up and 

declared, <dr class='alt5'>“This is that which was spoken 

by the prophet Joel: ‘And it shall come to 

pass in the last days, says God, That I will 

pour out of My Spirit on all flesh; Your 

sons and your daughters shall prophesy, 

Your young men shall see visions, Your 

old men shall dream dreams. And on My 

menservants and on My maidservants I 

will pour out My Spirit in those days; And 

they shall prophesy. I will show wonders 

in heaven above and signs in the earth 

beneath: Blood and fire and vapour of 

smoke. The sun shall be turned into 

darkness, and the moon into blood, 

before the coming of the great and 

awesome day of the Lord. And it shall 

come to pass that whoever calls on the 

name of the Lord shall be saved”  (Acts 

2:14-21)</dr class='alt5'>

</p>
<p>
I noticed that Joel’s original prophecy only 

spoke of prophesying once, but Peter 

interpreting its fulfilment, repeated it twice, 

as to emphasise the importance of what 

the sign of the Holy Spirit’s outpouring 

really is. What many have taken to be that 

the tongues were given to speak in the 

languages of the gathered people for 

preaching purposes, Peter actually 

interprets it as prophesying – prophesying 

that present-tense “now” “rhema” Word of 

God. Prophesying is different to 

preaching, although some preaching can 

be prophecy.
</p>
<h3>
Prophesying
</h3>
<p>
Many have preached that speaking in 

other tongues is the sign of the Baptism 

in the Holy Spirit (and I believe that those 

filled with the Holy Spirit should go on to 

speak in other tongues, if they have not 

already done so). Yes, speaking in other 

tongues is important, but we have far too 

often failed to emphasise the importance 

of the Holy Spirit-filled believers 

prophesying. 
</p>
<p>
Prophesying is for the <dr class='alt5'>“edification and exhortation and comfort to men”<br> (1 Cor 14:3).</dr class='alt5'> It is the sign or 

evidence that Jesus is in the midst of His 

people.  

<dr class='alt5'>“Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.” (Rev 19:10)</dr class='alt5'> When 

the presence of Jesus is felt in the 

gathering together of His people, there 

should be a free flowing of prophecy. It is 

God’s way of speaking to us through His 

body of Holy Spirit-filled believers. It is a 

gift that all Spirit-filled believers can 

exercise (1 Corinthians 14:31  ), and 

verse one of 1 Corinthians 14  teaches us 

to focus in especially on the Gift of 

Prophecy. Generally speaking, 

prophesying is misunderstood, and 

therefore under-valued in its operation 

amongst us.
</p>
<p>
So, briefly, Joel made no mention of 

speaking in tongues in his prophecy, but 

rather on prophesying as a major sign of 

that outpouring, and then Peter, 

interpreting the Day of Pentecost as being 

the fulfilment of that which Joel spoke, 

puts a double emphasis upon people 

prophesying. Joel mentioned prophesying 

once, but Peter in the Acts interpretation 

mentions it twice. This, being the case, 

means that we should look again at the 

importance of the Gift of Prophecy as a 

“now” word for the Christian Church, and 

take this gift much more seriously than 

we have tended to in the past.
</p>
<h3>
Gifts of the Holy
</h3>
<p>
Corinthians teaches us that the 

Gifts of the Holy Spirit function as a result 

of our <dr class='alt5'>“earnest desire” (1 Cor 12:31)</dr class='alt5'> (“to be zealous 

towards, to be eager for”). These are 

powerful words in their Scriptural 

understanding. The subject matter is 

serious and very important, and therefore 

we should be giving ourselves to the 

exercising of them.<br>Then in 1 Cor

13   we are given the reason – the 

motivation - why we should earnestly 

want to build up the body of Christ 

through the exercising of Spiritual Gifts. It 

is LOVE for God and for people! When 

we truly love one another, we will want to 

co-operate with the Holy Spirit and His 

wonderful gifts (1 Cor] 12:7-11)and release them out of our lives to build 

up that body!<br> When we come to 1 

Cor 14, Paul puts the two 

chapters (1 Cor 13) and(1 Cor

12) together in a nutshell. He 

says,<dr class='alt5'>“Pursue love , 

and desire spiritual gifts , but especially that you may 

prophesy.” (1 Cor 14:1)</dr class='alt5'><br> He clearly and definitely tells 

us to focus in on this Gift of Prophesying, 

and then spends the chapter telling us 

why. It is all to the building up of the 

Church (which is the people of God).
</p>
<p>
It was the Holy Spirit filled believers 

PROPHESYING that really impacted 

those watching and listening that day. 

Then, when Peter preached it as being 

the fulfilment of that which Joel 

prophesied all those years previously, we 

are told,<dr class='alt5'> “Then those who gladly received 

his (Peter’s) word were baptised; and that 

day about three thousand souls were 

added to them” (Acts 2:41).</dr class='alt5'> <br>That was 

some impact that the Holy Spirit – through 

those newly baptised in the Holy Spirit 

believers – made that day! The Holy Spirit 

spoke through those believers in 

prophecy! And the result of all that 

prophesying was a huge increase in 

those who turned to believe and follow 

Jesus Christ in a personal way!
</p>
<h3>
Why is prophesying so important?
</h3>
<p>
It is God’s will and way to speak to people 

– both saved and unsaved (see 1 

Corinthians 14:22-25). Unbelievers do not 

prophesy, only believers. But when 

believers are prophesying, any 

unbelievers within listening range can be 

powerfully impacted by the conviction, 

truth and life of the Holy Spirit flowing 

through us. Unbelievers have been saved 

as a direct result of people prophesying!
</p>
<p>
Prophecy flows out of a love relationship 

with Jesus. The gift and spirit of prophecy 

in operation brings “love letters from 

Jesus” to those assembled together in 

His name. True prophecies bring a 

positive, present time “now” message 

from the heart of God to the people. They 

build us up, inspire us, comfort us, and 

encourage us to know that God is for us, 

and has great things He wants to do in 

and through us.
</p>
<p>
There are many benefits when we 

understand and apply ourselves to the 

prophetic words that come forth through 

the Spiritual Gifts.<br><dr class='alt5'>“For you can all 

prophesy one by one, that all may learn 

(“to learn, intellectually from others, or 

from study and observation, to be 

informed, to understand”) and all may be 

encouraged (“to call to one, call near, to 

call for; every kind of speaking to, which is 

meant to produce a particular effect, e.g., 

exhortation, encouragement, comfort, 

etc.”)” (1 Cor 14:31).</dr class='alt5'> <br>The Gift of 

Prophecy produces “a learning,” and “an 

encouragement” to us. The more that 

prophecy comes forth, the more we will 

gain the benefits of that.
</p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>"Do not quench the Spirit. Do not despise prophecies.” (1 Thess

5:19-22).</dr class='alt5'><br>Some interesting words are 

used by some Bible translations: <br>“Do not 

put out the Spirit’s fire; do not treat 

prophecies with contempt.” (NIV). <br>“Do not smother 

the Holy Spirit. Do not scoff at those who 

prophesy” (TLB).
</p>
<p>
Receiving prophecies in our lives enables 

us to 
<ul>
<li>
“Wage the good warfare”
</li>
<li>
“have faith” 
</li>
<li>
“a good conscience” (see 1 Timothy 

1:18-20  ); 
</li>
<li>We are to“meditate (“to care for, take 

care for anything, so as to be able to 

perform it”) on these things (prophecies)” 
</li>
<li>
“give ourselves entirely to them (the 

prophecies)” 
</li>
<li>
“that our progress (“a going forward, 

advancement”) may be evident to all” 
</li>
<li>
“continue in them (those prophecies)” 
</li>
<li>We then “save ourselves” and 9. 

“those who hear us” (1 Timothy 4:12-16  

). God knew what He was doing when He 

gave us the Gift of Prophecy.
</li></p></ul>
<h3>
Prophecy in the Old Testament
</h3>
<p>
Even in Old Testament times, the 

prophets prophesying inspired the people 

to fulfil the work of God:<dr class='alt5'> “Then the prophet 

Haggai and Zechariah the son of Iddo, 

prophets, prophesied to the Jews who 

were in Judah and Jerusalem, in the 

name of the God of Israel, who was over 

them. So Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel 

and Jeshua the son of Jozadak 

(Jehozadak) rose up and began to build 

the house of God which is in Jerusalem; 

and the prophets of God were with them, 

helping them” (Ezra 5:1-2).</dr class='alt5'> 
</p>
<p>
Prophesying inspired and encouraged the 

people to do what God had called them to 

do. Without the inspiration of the 

prophets, the work had fallen into 

discouragement and disrepute.<br> In Ezra 
 we read, <dr class='alt5'>“So the elders of the Jews 

built, and they prospered (“to accomplish 

successfully; to reach the goal”) through 

the prophesying of Haggai the prophet 

and Zechariah the son of Iddo. And they 

built and finished it, according to the 

commandment of the God of Israel, and 

according to the command of Cyrus, 

Darius, and Artaxerxes king of Persia.” (Ezra 6:14)</dr class='alt5'><br>  

Prophecy inspired the people to finish the 

task God had given them to do.
</p>
<p>
In Numbers we read of the 70 

elders prophesying after God had given 

them an impartation of Moses spirit:<dr class='alt5'> “and it happened, when the Spirit rested upon them, that they prophesied, although they never did so again. (Numbers 11:25).</dr class='alt5'> 

<br>When Moses was questioned about all 

that prophesying, his response was,<dr class='alt5'> “Oh, 

that all the Lord’s people were prophets ...” (Numbers 11:29).</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
Samuel’s prophetic words to Saul were: 
<dr class='alt5'>
“And it will happen, when you have come 

there to the city, that you will meet a 

group of prophets coming down from the 

high place ... and they will be 

prophesying. Then the Spirit of the Lord 

will come upon you, and you will prophesy 

with them and be turned into another man 

... So it was, when he had turned his 

back to go from Samuel, that God gave 

him another heart; and all those signs 

came to pass that day. When they came 

there to the hill, there was a group of 

prophets to meet him; then the Spirit of 

God came upon him, and he prophesied 

among them” (1 Samuel 10:1-13).</dr class='alt5'> The 

terminology is that of the Old Covenant 

when the Spirit of God came upon people. 

In this New Covenant the terminology is 

that the Holy Spirit has been sent to live 

within us forever (John 14:15-31).
</p>
<p class='crb'>
Let us never forget that the operation of 

Spiritual Gifts is God’s idea. He sent the 

Spiritual Gifts with and in the Holy Spirit 

Who now lives inside all Spirit-filled 

believers in Jesus Christ. Be encouraged 

to PROPHESY out of a heart of great love 

for the people! <dr class='alt5'>“Therefore, brethren, desire earnestly to 

prophesy, and do not forbid to speak with 

tongues.” (1 Cor 14:39)</dr class='alt5'>
