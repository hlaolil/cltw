<h1>
 The importance of Jesus Christ's Resurrection 
</h1>
<p>
The resurrection of Jesus is important for 

several reasons. First, it witnesses to the 

immense power of God Himself. To 

believe in the resurrection is to believe in 

God. If God exists, and if He created the 

universe and has power over it, He has 

power to raise the dead. If He does not 

have such power, He is not a God worthy 

of our faith and worship.<br> Only He who 

created life can resurrect it after death, 

only He can reverse the hideousness that 

is death itself, and only He can remove 

the sting that is death and the victory that 

is the grave’s (1 Cor 15:54-55). In 

resurrecting Jesus from the grave, God 

reminds us of His absolute sovereignty 

over life and death.
</p>
<h3>
A testimony to our resurrection
</h3>
<p>
Second, the resurrection of Jesus is a 

testimony to the resurrection of human 

beings, which is a basic tenet of the 

Christian faith. Unlike all other religions, 

Christianity alone possesses a founder 

who transcends death and who promises 

that His followers will do the same. All 

other religions were founded by men and 

prophets whose end was the grave. As 

Christians, we take comfort in the fact 

that our God became man, died for our 

sins, and was resurrected the third day. 

The grave could not hold Him. He lives, 

and He sits today at the right hand of God 

the Father in heaven.
</p>
<p>
In 1 Cor 15, Paul explains in detail 

the importance of the resurrection of 

Christ. Some in Corinth did not believe in 

the resurrection of the dead, and in this 

chapter Paul gives five disastrous 

consequences if there were no 

resurrection:
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>And if Christ is not risen, then our preaching is empty and your faith is also empty.(1 Cor 15:14)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
<dr class='alt5'>Yes, and we are found false witnesses of God, because we have testified of God that He raised up Christ, whom He did not raise up—if in fact the dead do not rise (1 Cor 15:15);</dr class='alt5'> 
</p>
<p> 
<dr class='alt5'>And if Christ is not risen, your faith is futile; you are still in your sins!<br>(1 Cor 15:17);</dr class='alt5'> 
</p>
<p> 
<dr class='alt5'>Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. (1 Cor 15:18);</dr class='alt5'>  
</p>
<p> 
<dr class='alt5'>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men the most pitiable.<br> (1 Cor 15:19).<dr class='alt5'> 
</p>
<p> 
But Christ indeed has risen from 

the dead and <dr class='alt5'>“has become the first-fruits 

of those who have fallen asleep” (1 Cor 15:20),</dr class='alt5'> 

assuring that we will follow Him in 

resurrection.
</p>
<p>
The inspired Word of God guarantees the 

believer's resurrection at the coming of 

Jesus Christ for His Body (the Church) at 

the Rapture. Such hope and assurance 

results in a great song of triumph as Paul 

writes in 1 Cor 15: <dr class='alt5'><br>“O Death, 

where is your sting? O Hades, where is 

your victory?” (1 Cor 15:55)</dr class='alt5'>
</p>
<p>
How do these concluding verses relate to 

the importance of the resurrection? Paul 

answers,<dr class='alt5'> “Therefore, my beloved 

brethren, be steadfast, immovable, 

always abounding in the work of the Lord, 

knowing that your labour is not in vain in 

the Lord.” (1 Cor 15:58).</dr class='alt5'> He 

reminds us that because we know we will 

be resurrected to new life, we can suffer 

persecution and danger for Christ’s sake 

(1 Cor 15:29-31), just as He did. We can follow 

the example of the thousands of martyrs 

through history who gladly traded their 

earthly lives for everlasting life via the 

resurrection.
</p>
<p>
The resurrection is the triumphant and 

glorious victory for every believer. Jesus 

Christ died, was buried, and rose the third 

day according to the Scripture. And, He is 

coming again! The dead in Christ will be 

raised up, and those who remain and are 

alive at His coming will be changed and 

receive new, glorified bodies <br>(1 

Thess 4:13-18). Why is the 

resurrection of Jesus Christ important to 

salvation? It demonstrated that God 

accepted Jesus’ sacrifice on our behalf. It 

proves that God has the power to raise us 

from the dead.</p> 

<p class='block'><dr class='alt3'>The resurrection guarantees that those 

who believe in Christ will not remain dead, 

but will be resurrected to eternal life. 

That is our blessed hope!
