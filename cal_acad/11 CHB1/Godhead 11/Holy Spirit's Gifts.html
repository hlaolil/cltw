Holy Spirit's Gifts
</h1>
<h3>
The Gifts
</h3>
<p>
There are actually three biblical lists of the 

“gifts of the Spirit,” also known as spiritual 

gifts. The three main passages 

describing the spiritual gifts are:<p> Romans 12 

 The spiritual gifts 

identified are prophesying, 

serving, teaching, encouraging, giving, 

leadership, and mercy.(Romans 12:6-8)
 <p>The first list in 1 

Corinthians includes the word of 

wisdom, the word of knowledge, faith, 

healing, miraculous powers, prophecy, 

distinguishing between spirits, speaking in 

tongues and interpretation of tongues.(1 Cor 12:4-11)<p>  

The second list in 1 Corinthians 12
 includes 

healing, helps, governments, diversities of 

tongues. (1 Corinthians 12:28) 
</p>
<h3>
Prophecy 
</h3>
<p> 
The Greek word translated “prophesying” 

or “prophecy” in both passages properly 

means to “speak forth” or declare the 

divine will, to interpret the purposes of 

God, or to make known in any way the 

truth of God which is designed to 

influence people. The idea of telling the 

future was added sometime in the Middle 

Ages and is in direct contradiction to other 

scriptural passages that condemn such 

fortune-telling or predicting the future 

(Acts 16:16-18).
</p>
<h3>
Serving 
</h3>
<p> 
Also referred to as “ministering,” the 

Greek word diakonian, from which we get 

the English “deacon,” means service of 

any kind, the broad application of practical 

help to those in need.
</p>
<h3>
Teaching 
</h3>
<p>
This gift involves the analysis and 

proclamation of the Word of God, 

explaining the meaning, context and 

application to the hearer’s life. The gifted 

teacher is one who has the unique ability 

to clearly instruct and communicate 

knowledge, specifically the doctrines of 

the faith.
</p>
<h3>
Encouraging 
</h3>
<p> 
Also called “exhortation,” this gift is 

evident in those who consistently call 

upon others to heed and follow God’s 

truth, which may involve correction or 

building others up by strengthening weak 

faith or comforting in trials.
</p>
<h3>
Giving 
</h3>
<p>
Gifted givers are those who joyfully share 

what they have with others, whether it is 

financial, material, or the giving of 

personal time and attention. The giver is 

concerned for the needs of others and 

seeks opportunities to share goods, 

money and time with them as needs 

arise.
</p>
<h3>
Leadership
</h3>
<p>
The gifted leader is one who rules, 

presides over or has the management of 

other people in the church. The word 

literally means “guide” and carries with it 

the idea of one who steers a ship. One 

with the gift of leadership rules with 

wisdom and grace and exhibits the fruit of 

the Spirit in his life as he leads by 

example.
</p>
<h3>
Mercy 
</h3>
<p>
Closely linked with the gift of 

encouragement, the gift of mercy is 

obvious in those who are compassionate 

toward others who are in distress, 

showing sympathy and sensitivity coupled 

with a desire and the resources to lessen 

their suffering in a kind and cheerful 

manner.
</p>
<h3>
Word of wisdom 
</h3>
<p>
The fact that this gift is described as the 

“word” of wisdom indicates that it is one 

of the speaking gifts. This gift describes 

someone who can understand and speak 

forth biblical truth in such a way as to 

skilfully apply it to life situations with all 

discernment.
</p>
<h3>
Word of knowledge 
</h3>
<p>
This is another speaking gift that involves 

understanding truth with an insight that 

only comes by revelation from God. 

Those with the gift of knowledge 

understand the deep things of God and 

the mysteries of His Word.
</p>
<h3>
Faith 
</h3>
<p>
All believers possess faith in some 

measure because it is one of the gifts of 

the Spirit bestowed on all who come to 

Christ in faith (Galatians 5:22-23). The 

spiritual gift of faith is exhibited by one 

with a strong and unshakeable 

confidence in God, His Word, His 

promises, and the power of prayer to 

effect miracles.
</p>
<h3>
Healing
</h3>
<p>
Although God does still heal today, the 

ability of men to produce miraculous 

healings belonged to the apostles of the 

first century church to affirm that their 

message was from God. Christians today 

do not have the power to heal the sick or 

resurrect the dead. If they did, the 

hospitals and morgues would be full of 

these “gifted” people emptying beds and 

coffins everywhere.
</p>
<h3>
Miraculous powers 
</h3>
<p>
Also known as the working of miracles, 

this is another temporary sign gift which 

involved performing supernatural events 

that could only be attributed to the power 

of God (Acts 2:22). This gift was exhibited 

by Paul (Acts 19:11-12), Peter (Acts 3:6), 

Stephen (Acts 6:8), and Philip (Acts 

8:6-7), among others.
</p>
<h3>
Distinguishing (discerning) of spirits 
</h3>
<p>
Certain individuals possess the unique 

ability to determine the true message of 

God from that of the deceiver, Satan, 

whose methods include purveying 

deceptive and erroneous doctrine. Jesus 

said many would come in His name and 

would deceive many (Matthew 24:4-5), 

but the gift of discerning spirits is given to 

the Church to protect it from such as 

these.
</p>
<h3>
Speaking in tongues
</h3>
<p>
The gift of tongues is one of the 

temporary “sign gifts” given to the early 

Church to enable the gospel to be 

preached throughout the world to all 

nations and in all known languages. It 

involved the divine ability to speak in 

languages previously unknown to the 

speaker. This gift authenticated the 

message of the gospel and those who 

preached it as coming from God. The 

phrase <dr class='alt5'>“different kinds of tongues”</dr class='alt5'> or 

<dr class='alt5'>“varieties of tongues”</dr class='alt5'> 

effectively eliminates the idea of a 

“personal prayer language” as a spiritual 

gift.
</p>
<h3>
Interpretation of tongues 
</h3>
<p>
A person with the gift of interpreting 

tongues could understand what a 

tongues-speaker was saying even though 

he did not know the language that was 

being spoken. The tongues interpreter 

would then communicate the message of 

the tongues speaker to everyone else, so 

all could understand.
</p>
<h3>
Helps 
</h3>
<p>
Closely related to the gift of mercy is the 

gift of helps. Those with the gift of helps 

are those who can aid or render 

assistance to others in the church with 

compassion and grace. This has a broad 

range of possibilities for application. Most 

importantly, this is the unique ability to 

identify those who are struggling with 

doubt, fears, and other spiritual battles; to 

move toward those in spiritual need with a 

kind word, an understanding and 

compassionate demeanour; and to speak 

scriptural truth that is both convicting and 

loving.
