 	<h1>
No Finite picture of an Infinite God
</h1>
<p>
There have been many attempts to develop illustrations of the Trinity. However, none of the popular 

illustrations are completely accurate. The egg (or apple) fails in that the shell, white, and yolk are parts 

of the egg, not the egg in themselves, just as the skin, flesh, and seeds of the apple are parts of it, not 

the apple itself. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are not parts of God; each of them is God. The water 

illustration is somewhat better, but it still fails to adequately describe the Trinity. Liquid, vapour, and 

ice are forms of water. The Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are not forms of God, each of them is God. So, 

while these illustrations may give us a picture of the Trinity, the picture is not entirely accurate. An 

infinite God cannot be fully described by a finite illustration.
</p>
<p>
The doctrine of the Trinity has been a divisive issue throughout the entire history of the Christian church. 

While the core aspects of the Trinity are clearly presented in God’s Word, some of the side issues are not 

as explicitly clear. The Father is God, the Son is God, and the Holy Spirit is God—but there is only one 

God. That is the biblical doctrine of the Trinity. Beyond that, the issues are, to a certain extent, 

debatable and non-essential. Rather than attempting to fully define the Trinity with our finite human minds, 

we would be better served by focusing on the fact of God's greatness and His infinitely higher nature. <p>

“Oh, the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are His judgements 

and His ways past finding out! “For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has become His counsellor?”<br> 

(Romans 11:33-34).
