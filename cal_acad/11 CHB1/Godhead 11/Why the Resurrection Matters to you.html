<h1>
Why the Resurrection Matters to you
</h1>
<h2>
Explaining evidence and meaning of the 

resurrection
</h2>
<p>
Every day more and more people are 

taking a look -- for some, a second or 

more times -- at the historical person of 

Jesus of Nazareth. So why do His life and 

teachings still generate such interest 

today?
</p>
<h3>
What I Found in My Search
</h3>
<p>
To begin with, everything about Him was 

unique: The prophecies of His coming. 

His birth. His life. His teachings. His 

miracles. His death. And especially His 

resurrection. <font color="red"><font size="+1">It is history's most 

significant event.</font></font>
</p>
<p>
The validity of Jesus' claims about 

Himself rests on the Resurrection -- 

whether He rose from the dead or stayed 

in the grave. Many sceptics say that to 

believe in a risen Christ is nothing more 

than a blind leap of faith with little or no 

basis in truth.
</p>
<p>
When confronted with the facts, however, 

those who are intellectually honest have 

been forced to admit that the 

Resurrection is an historical event based 

on irrefutable proofs. On my spiritual 

journey from agnosticism to faith in 

Christ, I, like many people, had a problem 

with the Resurrection. But my personal 

study brought me to a firm conviction that 

a bodily resurrection is the only 

explanation for Christ's empty tomb. 

Several evidences helped me reach this 

conclusion.
</p>
<h3>
Evidence for the Resurrection
</h3>

<p>1st, Christ predicted His resurrection.<br> 

The Bible records,<dr class="alt5"> "From that time Jesus began to show to His disciples that He must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and be raised the third day." (Matthew 16:21).</dr class="alt5"> <br>Even though His 

followers did not understand what He was 

telling them at the time, they remembered 

His words and recorded them.</p>
<p>
2nd, Jesus made numerous 

appearances to His followers.<br> He 

comforted the mourners outside His tomb 

on Sunday morning.<br> On the road to 

Emmaus, He explained things about 

Himself from the Old Testament.<br> Later, 

He ate in their presence and invited them 

to touch Him. Scripture records that 

Jesus was seen by more than 500 at one 

time. Some may argue that a few people 

could have agreed to a deception, but 

how can one explain the collaboration of 

500 people?</p>
<p>
3rd, the unrelenting faith of the 

disciples convinces me of the 

Resurrection. Those disciples who were 

once so afraid that they deserted their 

Lord now courageously proclaimed this 

news, risking their lives to preach. Their 

bold and courageous behaviour does not 

make sense unless they knew with 

absolute certainty that Jesus had been 

raised from the dead.</p>
<p>
4th, the growth of the Christian church 

confirms the Resurrection.<br> Peter's first 

sermon, which dealt with Christ's 

resurrection, stirred people to receive Him 

as their living Saviour. Luke records the 

thrilling results: <dr class="alt5">"that day about three thousand souls were added to them." (Acts 2:41).</dr class="alt5"> And that group of believers has 

multiplied until now it reaches around the 

world. Today, there are hundreds of 

millions of believers.
</li></ul>

<p>
Finally, the testimony of hundreds of 

millions of transformed lives through the 

centuries shows the power of the 

Resurrection. Many have been delivered 

from addictions. The destitute and 

despairing have found hope. Broken 

marriages have been restored. The most 

conclusive proof for the resurrection of 

Jesus Christ is that He is living within 

believers today in all of His resurrected 

life and transforming power.
The Resurrection sets Christianity apart. 

No other religious leader has broken the 

power of death and conquered sin.
</p>
<h3>
Significance of the Resurrection
</h3>
<p>
The Resurrection confirms that Jesus is 

who He claimed to be. Let us consider 

the magnitude of this event:
</p>
<p>
The Resurrection proved that Christ 

was divine. The fact that Jesus Christ 

died on the cross does not prove in itself 

He is God. Jesus proved His deity by 

fulfilling the prophecies of His death and 

by His return from the grave. <br>The Bible 

declares that <dr class="alt5">"and declared to be the Son 

of God with power according to the Spirit 

of holiness, by the resurrection from the 

dead." (Rom 1:4).</dr class="alt5">
</p>
<p>The Resurrection proved Christ's 

power to forgive sin. The Bible asserts,<dr class="alt5"> 

"And if Christ is not risen, your faith is 

futile; you are still in your sins!" (1 

Cor 15:17).</dr class="alt5"> By rising from the 

dead, Jesus proved His authority and 

power to break the bonds of sin and to 

assure forgiveness and eternal life to all 

who accept His gift of salvation.
</p>
<p>
The Resurrection revealed Christ's 

power over death. The Bible records, <dr class="alt5">

"knowing that Christ, having been raised 

from the dead, dies no more. Death no 

longer has dominion over Him." (Rom 

6:9).</dr class="alt5">
</p> 
<p>The Resurrection secured our victory 

over death as well and <dr class="alt5">"and raised us up 

together, and made us sit together in the 

heavenly places in Christ Jesus," 

<br>(Eph 2:6).</dr class="alt5">
</p>
<p>The Resurrection defeated God's 

enemy. From the moment of his original 

rebellion until the day of the Cross, the 

devil fought viciously and cunningly to 

overthrow the kingdom of God. Satan 

must have thought he had dealt the final 

and decisive blow in this age-old war. But 

this was the devil's most serious 

miscalculation. The Cross was heaven's 

triumph. And when Jesus Christ arose, 

the power of sin and death was forever 

shattered. Because of the Resurrection, 

Christians need never fear Satan or death 

again.
</p>
<h3>
Completion of Redemption
</h3>
<p>
For 40 days after His death and 

resurrection, Christ appeared many times 

to His followers.<bk>
On one occasion, He gathered His 

remaining 11 disciples on a mountain in 

Galilee and gave them His Great 

Commission.<bk><dr class="alt5">
He said, "Go therefore and make 

disciples of all the nations, baptising them 

in the name of the Father and of the Son 

and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them 

to observe all things that I have 

commanded you; and lo, I am with you 

always, even to the end of the age.” 

Amen." (Matt 28:19,20)</dr class="alt5">
</p>
<p>
Later, the Book of Acts records that, on 

the Mount of Olives, He admonished His 

disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they 

were filled with the Holy Spirit and then to 

take His message to Jerusalem, Judea, 

Samaria and to the ends of the world 

(Acts 1:4,5,8).
</p>
<p>
Immediately after, He rose skyward and 

disappeared into the clouds, leaving the 

disciples staring after Him in amazed 

wonder. The ascension of Christ was the 

final act in the drama of redemption. His 

mission completed, Jesus Christ was 

exalted to His former glory.
</p>
<p class='crb'>

The resurrection of Jesus Christ ranks as 

history's most revolutionary event.
One cannot deny that He shook the world 

in His day.<bk>
But His life just as dramatically has 

shaped the course of history in our time.
The Resurrection is the final proof that 

Jesus Christ is who He claimed to be.
