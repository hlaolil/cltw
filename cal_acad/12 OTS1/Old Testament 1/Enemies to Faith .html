Enemies to Faith

<h3>
The Fight of Faith
</h3>
<p>
When we “fight the good fight of faith,” we can step out of the narrow place of failure into the boundless power of God.</p>
<p>
This article discusses the Christian’s<font color= "blue">
 “Fight the good fight of faith,” (1 Tim 6:12)</font>. I have sometimes heard people say that they are going to fight the devil. <br>I don’t know why, because:<br>Firstly they are no match for him.<br> Secondly, Jesus has already defeated the devil for us. Jesus was our substitute. I have also heard people say that they are going to fight sin. <br>But I am not going to fight sin. I’m going to preach the cure for sin. <br>Jesus is the cure.<br>

The only fight that the believer is called upon to fight is the “good fight of faith.” And if there is a fight, then there must be enemies or hindrances to faith. <br>If there were no enemies to faith, there would be no fight to it. <br>In this article we deal with six enemies to faith.</p>

<i>Failure to Understand What It Means to Be a New Creature in Christ</i></font></p>
<p>
<font color= "blue">
Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new. (2 Cor 5:17)</font>.<br>

A lack of understanding of what it means to be a new creature hinders our faith life. Many people do not realise that they are actually new creatures; they think that when they were saved God just forgave them of their sins. <br>But it would do little good if this were all the sinner received, for he is a child of the devil and would still go to hell. He has to be born again. He has to become a new creature, putting off his old sinful ways. No, we are not just forgiven sinners. We are not barely-getting-along church members. We are not living at the end of the block on Struggling-to-get-to-heaven Street next to Grumble Alley. That’s not for us. We are new creatures, created by God in Christ Jesus with the very life and nature of God in our spirits. We are children of God, sons of God, heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ Jesus</p>

<p><font color= #B22222;><i>
Failure to Understand Our Place in Christ</i></font></p>
<p>
Everywhere I go I suggest that Christians go through the New Testament, particularly the epistles, and write down the phrases, “in Christ,” “in whom,” and “in Him.” Writing them down will help you to remember them. <br>There are 133 such expressions in the New Testament. If you will read and meditate on these scriptures until they become a part of you, life will be different for you. As you read these verses, say to yourself, “This is who I am. This is what I have in Christ Jesus.”

In one church where I visited, there was a woman who the pastor described as one of the most outstanding Christian workers he had ever known. She was graduated from a leading seminary with a degree in Christian education, and she gave her services to the church free of charge. During our revival there I urged the people to begin memorising and claiming these verses. After awhile this woman came to me and said that she had written down twenty-five of these scriptures and had begun to confess them. She said that since she had been doing this, she had become an entirely new and different person. She had found that she didn’t worry any more. She said that she thought and acted differently. She felt differently. She was amazed at herself and couldn’t help but say sometimes, “Is this really me?” I told her that she was just now beginning to walk in the light of what she had all the time. She, just as many other Christians, didn’t have an understanding of what Christ is in her life, and this hinders faith. Getting this understanding cured this woman of her worry habit.</p>

Failure to Understand Righteousness</i></font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, that we might become the righteousness of God in Him. (2 Cor 5:21)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin. (1 John 1:7) </font>and therefore by the new birth we become a righteous new creature. <br>We know that God did not make any unrighteous new creature. We are created by God in Christ Jesus. He made a righteous new creature. We are sons and daughters of God as though we had never sinned. We can stand in His presence without sin-consciousness, without any feelings of guilt or shame. We don’t have to be tongue-tied because of fear. We can come into God’s presence because we belong there. When we were born again, our sins were remitted because our past life stopped existing. God said <font color= "blue">"I will forgive their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more.”(Jer 31:34)</font>.<br>And if He doesn’t remember them, why should we?</p>
<p>
“But I have committed sins since becoming a Christian. How can I be righteous?” some may ask. The answer to this question is, <font color= "blue">“If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.”(1 John 1:9)</font> When the believer who has sinned confesses his sin and asks for forgiveness, the Lord does two things<br>
First, He forgives him.<br>
Second, He cleanses him from all unrighteousness<br>

When we have sinned, we feel guilty and have a sense of unrighteousness.<br> We feel unworthy to come into God’s presence. But when we confess our sin, He forgives and He also cleanses. We regain our right standing with Him.<br>

The word “unrighteousness” is just the word “righteousness” with the prefix “un” in front of it meaning “not” or “non-righteousness.” If we are cleansed from “non-righteousness,” then we are righteous again.</p>

<p><font color= #B22222;><i>
Failure to Understand Our Right To Use the Name of Jesus</i></font></p>
<p>
<font color= "blue">Most assuredly, I say to you, whatever you ask the Father in My name He will give you. Until now you have asked nothing in My name. Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full. (John 16:23-24)</font><br>

When we fully realise the power of Jesus’ name, when we understand what that name will do, then we can defeat Satan and enjoy victory.<br>

In the sixteenth chapter of Mark, Jesus told His disciples, <font color= "blue">“Go into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He who believes and is baptised will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned. And these signs will follow those who believe:  (Mark 16:15-17)</font>.<br>

To them that believe the gospel these signs shall follow them – not just the Early Church, not just the apostles, not just the preachers. All believers can cast out devils in His name. Every believer has authority over demons and evil spirits in the name of Jesus. In His name they will speak with new tongues. In His name they will lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. [Note: But the scripture also says: <font color= "blue">"Do not lay hands on anyone hastily, nor share in other people’s sins; keep yourself pure" (1 Tim 5:22)</font>. You can only cast out demons where you have the approval of the person prayed for, and it is dangerous to be presumptuous about this. We should be specifically instructed by God. <br>However, when it comes to ourselves, our family, and those for whom we are spiritually responsible, we have this authority].<br>

The name of Jesus has authority and power today, and that name belongs to us.</p>

Enemy No. 5

<p><font color= #B22222;><i>
Failure To Act Upon the Word</i></font></p>
<p>
If we know that God’s Word is true, and we act as though it is true, then it becomes a reality in our lives. <br>The Bible says, <font color= "blue">“Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and lean not on your own understanding;” (Prov 3:5)</font>. All that is necessary for us to ask is, “What does God’s Word say?”

People often ask me why they don’t receive healing. <br>They quote scriptures such as <font color= "blue">“... Himself took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses” (Matt 8:17)</font>, and <br><font color= "blue">“ who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness—by whose stripes you were healed.” <br>(1 Peter 2:24)</font>. They tell me they believe these scriptures. Then I ask them, “But have you ever acted like these verses of scripture are true?”<br>

Real faith is the child of the knowledge of God’s Word. Act on the Word and get real faith from it. Instead of trying to believe, act upon the Word.</p>
<h3>
Enemy No. 6 
</h3>
<p><font color= #B22222;><i>
Failure To Hold Fast to Our Confession of Faith</i></font></p>
<p>
<font color= "blue">
For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. (Rom 10:10)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
For assuredly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, "Be removed and be cast into the sea," and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that those things he says will be done, he will have whatever he says. Therefore I say to you, whatever things you ask when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you will have them. (Mark 11:23-24)</font></p>
<p>
Faith is measured by our confession. Our usefulness in the Lord is measured by our confession. Eventually we become what we confess, whether for good or bad. There is a confession of our hearts and a confession of our lips, and when these two harmonise, we become mighty in our prayer life. <br>The reason that so many are defeated is that they have a negative confession. They are talking of their weaknesses and failures, and invariably they go down to the level of their confession.<br>

There is a scriptural law that I discovered from the lips of Jesus in which is quoted above. This is that our confessions rule us. We are what we say. <br>The woman with the issue of blood, whose story we find in Mark 5:25-34, said, <font color= "blue">
“If only I may touch His clothes, I shall be made well.” (Mark 5:28)<br>

And He said to her,“Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be healed of your affliction.” (Mark 5:34)</font><br>
 What she said was her faith speaking, and it came to pass.</p>
<p>
When we “fight the good fight of faith,” as the Apostle Paul admonishes us, we can step out of the narrow place of failure and weakness in which we live into the boundless power of God.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto thou art also called, and hast professed a good profession before many witnesses” <br>(1 Tim 6:12)</font>.</p>
<p>
<font color= "blue">
Faith in Action: “But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only ...” <br>(James 1:22)<font>.
