   <h1>
Allegories and Metaphors
</h1>
<p>
Reading the Bible from Exodus to Numbers you will uncover miracles, metaphors and allegories. This article is a story of a people on a journey and their struggle to accept God as the Almighty. 
<h2>
Stage One
</h2>
<p>
The eleven Camps from Ramses to the Mountain of the Law.<br> 
You cannot read the first part of the journey out of Egypt, and not recognise that God has a plan for His people.
<h3>
1. Shouts and Cries
</h3> 
<p>
It began with the death and pain of Egypt (Ex 12:29) contrasted with celebration and departure of Israel:<br> 
<font color= "blue">They departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the day after the Passover the children of Israel went out with boldness in the sight of all the Egyptians. For the Egyptians were burying all their first born, whom the Lord had killed among them. Also on their gods the Lord had executed judgements  Then the children of Israel moved from Rameses and camped at Succoth.(Num 33:3)</font>.</p>
<h3>
2. Heavenly GPS 
</h3>
<p>
Next was the story of God’s miraculous guidance. <br><font color= "blue">They departed from Succoth and camped at Etham, which is on the edge of the wilderness, (Num 33:6)</font>.</p>
<p><font color= "blue"> 
And the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so as to go by day and night.<br> He did not take away the pillar of cloud by day or the pillar of fire by night from before the people. (Ex 13:21-22)</font>.</p>
<h3>
3. Baiting 
</h3>
<p>
God sets up Pharaoh.<br> <font color= "blue">They moved from Etham and turned back to Pi Hahiroth, which is east of Baal Zephon; and they camped near Migdol. (Num 33:7)</font> </p>
<p>
Ex 14 tells the story of how God told Moses to camp by the sea after wandering a bit (remembered in the places named here) so that Pharaoh would see them wandering and chase after them!. Pharaoh took the bait and chased after them. God parted the sea, and then swallowed up the Egyptians, causing great reverence to overtake the people of Israel.</p>
<p>
God has a plan. It may not always appear that God is at work, and sometimes the way God works is so incredibly difficult to discern. Who beside our God would have planned for Pharaoh to resist so that a contest could form and God could fill the hands of His people? Who would have thought ahead to the coming generations of Pharaohs and recognised the need to bring Egypt and her self-made gods to their needs before the Holy One, so that Israel would be left unmolested to flourish when they arrived in Canaan? God did!<br> He did it according to a plan. Who would have thought of a desert GPS guidance system to get the people to follow Him? God did! <br>He knew where He wanted His people and when. Who would have told the people to appear to be wandering so He could draw Pharaoh in and crush his chariots – the one danger that would have haunted Israel for the next four decades in the wilderness of Sin? God did!<br> Because He wanted Israel to settle down and organise into a nation.</p>
<p>
When it appears this old world is spinning out of control, it isn’t.<br> God is at work. His plan is complex, and His power is unbounded by human will. No one can overrule Him. If He allows something, it won’t be simply human sin sickness that causes it – it passed through God’s stamp of approval toward His plan. That is easier to say that to truly accept.</p>
<p>
Did not this plan put His own people in more peril? Did not this plan drag out the bitter hardship of slavery and abuse on His people longer? Yes, it did. When a believer exclaims: “God has a plan!” they do so in the face of a world that would reshape God to their own sense of justice, their own sense of fairness, and their own sense of timing. God has a plan – but men and women who do not believe in Him do not like to hear that. <br>He is not a malleable God – He will not be shaped, trained to jump through the hoops of our timing. Ultimately, belief that God has a plan is an expression of belief in God’s Sovereignty. A Sovereign has no need to explain the details of His plan to His followers. Job discovered that lesson.</p>
<p>
When people demand that God explain Himself, they are often saying they don’t believe that He knows what He knows, sees what He sees and understands what He understands. Recognising that God has a plan is recognition of God’s place above our lives – and that is something a non-believer does not want to do. Nevertheless, God has a plan!<br>
Not only that, but where God guides, God provides. <br>Look at the whole next segment of the journey to the Mountain of the Law</p>
<h3>
4. Bitterness: 
</h3>
<p>
The people face the reality they are unprepared for the desert.<br> <font color= "blue">They departed from before Hahiroth and passed through the midst of the sea into the wilderness, went three days journey in the Wilderness of Etham, and camped at Marah (Num 33:8)</font>. 
<br>Thirsty, the people came to Marah, a place of bitter calcium and magnesium springs, and found water that would cause terrible cramps and intestinal distress. God provided what they needed, not what they wanted.</p>
<h3>
5. Blessing
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
They moved from Marah and came to Elim. At Elim were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees; so they camped there (Num 33:9)</font><br> 
The people learned that God had prepared places of rest and provision in the wilderness, in spite of the inhospitable appearance. God had plenty for them in places they knew nothing of, yet they needed to keep following Him past bitterness and into blessing.
<h3>
6. Bread 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
They moved from the Red Sea and camped in the Wilderness of Sin. <br>(Num 33:11)</font>
<br> 
Ex 16 recounts this journey to have taken place one month into their travels, more than half way to the Mountain of the Law.<br> At the point their grain had run out, God began providing the manna to them for the next forty years, until they came into Canaan (Josh 5:10-12). <br>Cheese they had, perhaps even some eggs, but the staple of grain used to supplement both man and flock was running scarce – and God showed something new. God has more options to supply than we can see.
<h3>
7. Birds
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
They journeyed from the Wilderness of Sin and camped at Dophkah. <br>(Num 33:12)</font>
<br> 
In the journey into the wilderness of Sin, they left the sea, and any fish they could have caught. Turning inland, they hungered for something more than manna, and God gave them quails.<br> 
<font color= "blue">They departed from Dophkah and camped at Alush. (Num 33:13)</font>
<h3>
8. Drink and Defend
</h3>
<p>
<font color= "blue">
“They moved from Alush and camped at Rephidim, where there was no water for the people to drink. (Num 33:14)</font><br>
The story of Ex 17 opens with the grumbling of thirsty Israelites, and the instruction for Moses <font color= "blue">
Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock in Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, that the people may drink.” (Ex 17:6)</font>. <br>Moses renamed the place he associated with his call by God the new names of Massah (Heb: trial) and later a similar place called Meribah (Heb: provocation). Meribah is not the same place as Massah and not at the same time, but connected by the same “water from the rock” experience in Num 20:8-11– except Meribah is where God said speak to the rock (Psa 95:7-8). <br>Shortly after God provided the water from the rock on the west of Horeb – a band of marauding Amalekites attacked (perhaps because they were taking the stored water?) and Joshua got his first command of an army of Israel to fight (Ex 17:8-16) and the victory was celebrated by giving God the title <br><font color= "blue">“The Lord Is My Banner;” (Ex 17:15)</font>.
<h3>
9. Consultation
</h3>
<p>
The Amalekites weren’t the only one who heard about Israel’s camp in the Wilderness of Sin – the Midianites also heard. Sometime during the time of camping at Rephidim, perhaps near the end of the fifty days of the journey, Jethro the father-in-law of Moses came out to see Moses and his family <br>(Ex 18) and told Moses to spread out the workload.<br> <font color= "blue">They departed from Rephidim and camped in the Wilderness of Sinai <br>(Num 33:15) (Ex 19:1-2)</font>.<br> 
 <font color= "blue">In the third month after the children of Israel had gone out of the land of Egypt, on the same day, they came to the Wilderness of Sinai (Ex 19:1)</font>.</p>
<h3>
Where God Guides, God Provides. 
</h3>
<p                                         >
He can provide water in a desert for thousands, or counsel in a tent for one leader. He can fill a net with fish, or a hungry belly with manna. He can store rain water in a rock wall or supply strength from a team mate holding up your arms during a conflict.</p>
<h2>
Stage Two
</h2>
<p>
Fifty Days Later – Camping by the Mountain of the Law (Ten Months- Ex 20-40;<br> Num 1:1-10:11).<br>
They arrived at the Mountain and met God. Some only saw His power from a distance, seventy saw Him pass by a prepared lunch table.<br> One talked with Him and got a tablet cut from His hand. Here is the lesson: <br>God knows what He thinks. He wasn’t waiting for a poll or survey to make the rules of right and wrong. He wasn’t “getting input” from Moses. <br>God knows what is right, because God Defines what is right. He also is keenly aware that fallen human nature isn’t keen on following what is right ...</p>
<p>
During the time Moses was on the Mountain of the Law (Ex. 24:18), the people rebelled. Three thousand were involved in a calf worship uprising, together with an orgy that followed the inaugural celebration (Ex. 32). <br>God tipped off Moses, who seemed in no hurry to go back to the people, and Moses angrily broke the tablets he brought from God when he saw the party. He called on Levites to kill those involved (3,000 according to Ex 32:18).<br> In the face of this bold mutiny, God threatened not to go personally with Moses to the Promised Land, though He would supply an angelic guide.<br> Moses pleaded with God, and God relented and replaced the tablets <br>(Ex. 34:1ff). <br>He kept meeting with Moses, who walked from the presence of the Holy One with a shining face (Ex. 34:29ff).</p>
<p>
Our faith is built on the truth that God knows what He thinks.<br> He doesn’t need men to try to make right more popular. He requires only that we live by His Spirit and His Word – and that we understand His absolute right to move in history, and in our lives. We don’t have to understand His reasons, we have to follow His Words. We don’t need to make His Words softer to win Him a greater popularity, we need to speak them openly, cherish them lovingly, and live them humbly. If the Bible means anything in all its content, it means this: God knows what He thinks and says what He means.</p>
<h2>
Stage Three
</h2>
<p>
Moving from the Mountain of the Law to Kadesh (Num 10:11-14:38).

<p>
The next stage after Sinai illustrates vividly the common frailties of people. The people didn’t trust Moses, and they didn’t trust God. They wanted what they wanted, when they wanted it. They fussed and fumed ...</p>
<h3>
1. Greed
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
They moved from the Wilderness of Sinai and camped at Kibroth-hattaavah (Num 33:16)</font>. The people left the mountain in fanfare thirteen months after their departure from Egypt (Num. 10:11). The camp moved out, complete with a new worship centre of the Tabernacle. Complaints about the conditions caused a fire to break out on the edge of the camp, and greed overcame people on God’s next wave of quail brought to the camp – so a sickness set in killing those who incessantly cried for more than they needed. They buried many at the site of the “grave of the greedy” or Kibroth – hatta ‘avah.</p>
<h3>
2. Healing
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
They departed from Kibroth-hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth (Num 33:17)</font>. To get away from the cemetery, they founded a little village (chatser) and called it “The Villages”, or Hazeroth. It took time to heal from their losses.</p>
<h3>
3. Mistrust 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
They departed from Hazeroth and camped at Rithmah (Num 33:18)</font> <br>[in Paran -Num 12:16]. (The whole encampment encompasses the stories of Num 13:1-14:38).<br> It began with Moses’ own family expressing jealousy about Moses and his special relationship with God. Miriam stalled all forward movement while she recovered from God’s temporary plague of leprosy.<br> Next was the mistrust of the spies sent to the Hebron plateau. They returned with grapes and stories – but the majority of the spies would not urge the people to take the land as God instructed.</p>
<p>
This stage, filled with rebellion and grave stones, reminds us of an essential truth:<br>God’s Plan requires our Surrender. God’s people need to follow God’s Word and God’s will – or disaster follows. When we want and pursue what God says we aren’t supposed to have, we hurt those around us. When we delay in following God’s stated purposes, we stifle God’s blessings. We go on in a desert while God provides in the land He called us to live in.<br>Believers are called to surrender their wants to God and trust Him for the direction and provision. We won’t find the provision in a place He hasn’t told us to be. Conversely, we will experience greater communion with Him when we walk beside Him, and refuse to wander off.</p>
<h2>
Stage Four
</h2>
<p>
Eighteen Encampments in the southern deserts of Israel ending at Kadesh (Num 14:39-20:14).</p>
<p>
The eighteen camps are mentioned in Num 33:19-36 There is no cross reference for these in another travel log outside of Numbers. <br>Based on Deut 1:46-2:1 it appears Israel encamped for a length of time at Kadesh the first time “many days” at the time of the spies search, and God’s penalties to the people as a result of their disbelief.<br> The record is near to Rithmah, an undetermined location not far from Kadesh. <br>Numbers includes the list of camps without commentary:<br>
<font color= "blue">They departed from Rithmah and camped at Rimmon Perez. They departed from Rimmon Perez and camped at Libnah. They moved from Libnah and camped at Rissah. They journeyed from Rissah and camped at Kehelathah. They went from Kehelathah and camped at Mount Shepher. They moved from Mount Shepher and camped at Haradah. They moved from Haradah and camped at Makheloth. They moved from Makheloth and camped at Tahath. They departed from Tahath and camped at Terah. They moved from Terah and camped at Mithkah. They went from Mithkah and camped at Hashmonah. They departed from Hashmonah and camped at Moseroth. They departed from Moseroth and camped at Bene Jaakan. They moved from Bene Jaakan and camped at Hor Hagidgad. They went from Hor Hagidgad and camped at Jotbathah. They moved from Jotbathah and camped at Abronah. They departed from Abronah and camped at Ezion Geber. They moved from Ezion Geber and camped in the Wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh. (Num 33:19-36)</font></p>
<p>
The eighteen encampments chronicle the venture of most of the thirty eight of the total forty years of wandering. It then took another two years to place the people in the valley opposite Jericho. <br>This was forty years to reach what would have been a march of only a few days to get into the heart of the Promised Land when the spies went up from Kadesh through Wadi Zin.</p>
<p>
A fourth lesson is so obvious in this section:<br>When God Calls – Answer Him. God told the people to go in to the land, but they chose a “plan b” for their lives.<br> How many believers can identify with that?</p>
<p>
God told you to marry a believer, but you didn’t – plan b created a huge difficulty.</p>
<p>
God told you to live within your means – but plan b has meant years of recovery from debts.</p>
<p>
God told you to study His Word and know it – but years of distraction in your plan b has made you spiritually anaemic and open to making the wrong judgements.</p>
<p>
We could go on and on ... but we all get the point. Delayed obedience is disobedience. When God is Calling – Pick up the Phone.</p>
<h2>
Stage Five
</h2>
<p>
Ten Encampments from Kadesh to the Jordan River (Num 20:14-33:49; cp. Num 26:63)</p>
<p>
Tired of running and ready to head, at least little by little, toward the Promised Land – the children of Israel moved another ten times – largely making their way around the land on the eastern side of the Jordan – a choice that would cost them two and one-half tribes, a deeply destructive compromise with women of the region and several difficult battles is recounted in a simple quick reference:</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
They moved from Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, on the boundary of the land of Edom.
Then Aaron the priest went up to Mount Hor at the command of the Lord, and died there in the fortieth year after the children of Israel had come out of the land of Egypt, on the first day of the fifth month. Aaron was one hundred and twenty-three years old when he died on Mount Hor. Now the king of Arad, the Canaanite, who dwelt in the South in the land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel. So they departed from Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah. They departed from Zalmonah and camped at Punon. They departed from Punon and camped at Oboth. They departed from Oboth and camped at Ije Abarim, at the border of Moab. They departed from Ijim[a] and camped at Dibon Gad. They moved from Dibon Gad and camped at Almon Diblathaim. They moved from Almon Diblathaim and camped in the mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.  They departed from the mountains of Abarim and camped in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho. They camped by the Jordan, from Beth Jesimoth as far as the Abel Acacia Grove in the plains of Moab. (Num 33:37-49)</font></p>
<p>
At the risk of being overly Obvious, there is a simple lesson we have in these eleven places and ten journeys: not being where you are told leaves you open to encountering tests for which you aren’t prepared. Skip school and hang out with trouble makers off campus and you will end up facing challenges you may not have bargained for. Sneak into the party with the “druggies” and “partiers” and you will be confronted with peer pressure and choices on a whole different level.<br>Choose a philosophy program in a godless institution, and you may find yourself standing like a tree in front of a flame thrower. <br>Spend late hours at the office under pressure with the new intern and you may find yourself ruining your marriage. choose to spend your time where God has Told You to Be. You may feel ready for the tests, but no one ever failed when they avoided the test altogether.</p>
<p>
The end of the passage is four commands and a warning in the Laws of Conquest. The four commands included:

The whole of the travel log had a point – and that was to let the lessons of the past inform the choices concerning the future. God gave four brisk and simple commands:<br>

<font color= "blue">Now the Lord spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan, across from Jericho, saying, “Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them <br>(Num 33:50-51)</font>:</p>
 <p><font size="+1">
Command One</font><p>
<p>
Don’t compromise with wickedness. <br> <font color= "blue">... "When you cross over the Jordan into the land of Canaan, then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before you, and destroy all their figured stones, and destroy all their molten images and demolish all their high places; (Num 33:51b)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">
Command Two</font><p>
<p>
Don’t stop short of Obedience.<br> <font color= "blue">you shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land and dwell in it, for I have given you the land to possess. (Num 33:53)</font>
<p><font size="+1">
Command Three</font><p>
<p>
Trust My Direction and Provision again.<br> <font color= "blue">And you shall divide the land by lot as an inheritance among your families; to the larger you shall give a larger inheritance, and to the smaller you shall give a smaller inheritance; there everyone’s inheritance shall be whatever falls to him by lot.  (Num 33:54)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">
Command Four</font><p>
<p>
Preserve the Importance of the Family Structure.<br> <font color= "blue">... ”You shall inherit according to the tribes of your fathers. (Num 33:54b)</font></p>
<p><font size="+1">
The One Warning</font><p>
<p>
Five stages gave way to a record of four commands that eventually came down to One Warning: Be the distinct people I have called you to be, or you will not be a people at all.<br>
<font color= "blue">
But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then it shall be that those whom you let remain shall be irritants in your eyes and thorns in your sides, and they shall harass you in the land where you dwell. Moreover it shall be that I will do to you as I thought to do to them.” <br>(Num 33:55-56)</font></p>
<p>
Don’t get smug about being My children, act out of humility and obedience. How do we accomplish that? The best was is to look back, and review the lessons God already taught you:</p>
<p>
God has a plan</p>
<p>
Where God guides, God provides. </p>  
<p>
God knows what He thinks, and says what He means.</p>
<p>
God’s plan requires surrender.</p>
<p>
When God calls – answer Him.</p>
<p>
Choose to be where He tells you – or face testing that exposes your weakness.</p>
<p>
Before we move ahead, we should look back. Careful observations of the lessons of our past will help us make fewer mistakes in our move forward.</p>
