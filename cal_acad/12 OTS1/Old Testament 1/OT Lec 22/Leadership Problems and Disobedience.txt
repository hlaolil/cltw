Leadership Problems and Disobedience

<h2>
Moses' Complaint to the Lord 
</h2>
<p>
Now Moses brings the problems to the Lord in a kind of petulant way.<br>
<font color= "blue">
"So Moses said to the Lord, “Why have You afflicted Your servant? And why have I not found favour in Your sight, that You have laid the burden of all these people on me? Did I conceive all these people? Did I beget them, that You should say to me, Carry them in your bosom, as a guardian carries a nursing child, to the land which You swore to their fathers? Where am I to get meat to give to all these people? For they weep all over me, saying, Give us meat, that we may eat. I am not able to bear all these people alone, because the burden is too heavy for me. If You treat me like this, please kill me here and now—if I have found favour in Your sight—and do not let me see my wretchedness!" (Num 11:11-15)</font></p>
<p>
This is not one of Moses' greatest leadership moments. He blames God for the problems. They're your problem, he tells God. Why do I have to deal with Your problem people? At the root of Moses' misery, however, are two elements:</p>
<p>
The burden of leadership is too heavy for him.</p>
<p>
He knows he is inadequate to supply what the people are demanding.</p>
<p>
Moses is at his wits end. Unless God backs him up, he can't face his own ruin.</p> 

God answers Moses in two ways:<br>

God puts some of His Spirit on 70 of Israel's elders (Num 11:24-30)
God promises abundant meat (Num 11:31-34)
God's promise of a month's supply of meat is so huge even Moses can't believe it. (Num 11:21-22). Moses' vision of God is too small! Then God rebukes Moses and tells him to tell the people what He said, even if he can't envision it!

“Has the Lord’s arm been shortened? Now you shall see whether what I say will happen to you or not.” So Moses went out and told the people the words of the Lord," (Num 11:23-24a)</font>
<h3>
The Quail and Plague 
</h3>
<p>
For God, providing meat wasn't a problem.

"Now a wind went out from the Lord, and it brought quail from the sea and left them fluttering near the camp, about a day’s journey on this side and about a day’s journey on the other side, all around the camp, and about two cubits (about a metre)above the surface of the ground." (Num 11:31)</font></p>
<p>
These people who had demanded "other food" in their unbelief, now had much more than they could even eat. It began to spoil, and many of them died from food poisoning, a "severe plague" from the Lord.</p>

<h2>
The Rock and the Rod
</h2>
<p>
The first striking of the Rock took place early in the Exodus and is a picture of Him who was stricken for us (cf. Isa 53:4), but the second striking of the Rock took place at the end of the 40 years in the wilderness, where the Rock was clearly meant to be a symbol of the victory that is based upon our Lord's sacrifice, a Second Advent reference, just as the entrance into the land is typical of the restoration of Israel after the Second Advent (i.e., so we have two Rocks representing two advents; cf. the colt and the foal in Matt 21:1-5, also bearing the same two-advent symbolism).</p>
<p>
By striking the Rock instead of speaking to it as he was instructed - and striking it twice at that - Moses sent the wrong message entirely, suggesting, symbolically, that the first striking had been insufficient, and that (again, symbolically) Christ's sacrifice once and for all had not been enough - something more was needed (and a double effort at that!). Given that exactly this issue has been a tremendous problem for Israel throughout her later history, Moses' action, while it may seem minor to us, has major implications.</p>
<p>
The book of Hebrews was written largely to address this issue of the continuation of Jewish believers in sacrifices through which they were essentially also continuing to "strike the Rock", thus denying by implication that Christ's work on the cross was sufficient for salvation. In the same second context, Num 20:12 makes this issue clear. For the basis of God's rebuke of Moses and Aaron is that they did not believe/trust Him enough (analogous to and typical of future Jews failing to appreciate Christ's sacrifice) so as "to sanctify" Him or "consider Him holy" (analogous to and typical of future Jewish leaders failing to honour Christ's sacrifice).</p>
<p>
Seen in this light, Moses' lapse and God's treatment of it should have been a powerful and unmistakable message to future generations of Israel: if even the greatest spiritual leader of Israel would be held to account for failing to appreciate God's gracious Gift once given, how much more would this not be true for those not of Moses' stature? The price Moses (and Aaron) paid for this disobedience to the Lord's command was severe: neither of them was allowed to enter the land (a penalty which looks forward to that future day when those of Israel who do not repent will likewise not be allowed to enter the land upon the Messiah's return: (Ezek.20:30-38)</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Go up this mountain ... and die on the mountain which you ascend, and be gathered to your people, just as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people; 51 because you trespassed against Me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah Kadesh, in the Wilderness of Zin, because you did not hallow Me in the midst of the children of Israel." (Deut 32:49-51) </font></p>
<p>
Even in this failure, Moses stands as an example for all future generations. In Moses' case, there were mitigating circumstances, to be sure, but even this lapse and the consequences it engendered have served to fulfil the purposes of God. And there is also the fact that Moses' work is not yet done. Along with Elijah, the other prominent man of God whose body was spared corruption, Moses will be revived in the early days of the Tribulation to fulfil an important ministry of turning Israel back from this very hardness of heart, and turning many back from the same tendency he symbolised on this occasion of failing to treat God as holy by failing to appreciate, accept and respect the Messiah's sacrifice (Rev 11).</p>
