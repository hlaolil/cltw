<p>
These sermons were given during the 40-day period prior to Israel’s entering the Promised Land. The first sermon was delivered on the 1st day of the 11th month (Deut 1:3), and the Israelites crossed the Jordan 70 days later, on the 10th day of the 1st month (Joshua 4:19). Subtract 30 days of mourning after Moses’ death (Deut 34:8), and we’re left with 40 days. The year was 1410 B.C.</p>
<h3>
Purpose of Writing
</h3>
<p>
A new generation of Israelites was about to enter the Promised Land. This multitude had not experienced the miracle at the Red Sea or heard the law given at Sinai, and they were about to enter a new land with many dangers and temptations. The book of Deuteronomy was given to remind them of God’s law and God’s power.</p>

<p><font color= "blue">
“You shall not add to the word which I command you, nor take from it, that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you”  (Deut 4:2)</font></p>

“Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one! You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. “And these words which I command you today shall be in your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up.” (Deut 6:4-7)</font></p>

“and he said to them: “Set your hearts on all the words which I testify among you today, which you shall command your children to be careful to observe—all the words of this law. For it is not a futile thing for you, because it is your life, and by this word you shall prolong your days in the land which you cross over the Jordan to possess” (Deut 32:46-47)</font> </p>
<h3>
Brief Summary
</h3>
<p>
The Israelites are commanded to remember four things: God’s faithfulness, God’s holiness, God’s blessings, and God’s warnings. The first three chapters recap the trip from Egypt to their current location, Moab. Deut 4 is a call to obedience, to be faithful to the God Who was faithful to them.</p>
<p>
Deut 5 to 26 are a repetition of the law. The Ten Commandments, the laws concerning sacrifices and specials days, and the rest of the law are given to the new generation. Blessings are promised to those who obey (Deut 5:29; 6:17-19; 11:13-15), and famine is promised to those who break the law (Deut 11:16-17).</p>
<p>

The theme of blessing and cursing is continued in Deut 27-30. This portion of the book ends with a clear choice set before Israel:<font color= "blue"> “I call heaven and earth as witnesses today against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing; therefore choose life, that both you and your descendants may live.” (Deut 30:19)</font> 
God’s desire for His people is found in what He recommends: “choose life”.</p>
<p>
In the final chapters, Moses encourages the people; commissions his replacement, Joshua; records a song; and gives a final blessing to each of the tribes of Israel. Deut 34 relates the circumstances of Moses’ death. He climbed Mt. Pisgah, where the Lord showed him the Promised Land that he could not enter. At 120 years old, but still with good eyesight and the strength of youth, Moses died in the presence of the Lord. The book of Deuteronomy ends with a short obituary on this great prophet.</p>
<h3>
Foreshadows
</h3>
<p>
Many New Testament themes are present in the Book of Deuteronomy. The foremost among them is the necessity of keeping perfectly the Mosaic Law and the impossibility of doing so. The endless sacrifices necessary to atone for the sins of the people—who continually transgressed the Law—would find their fulfilment in: <font color= "blue">
“By that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all." (Heb 10:10).</font>
Because of His atoning work on the cross, we would need no further sacrifices for sin.</p>
<p>
God’s choosing of the Israelites as His special people foreshadows His choosing of those who would believe in Christ (1 Peter 2:9). In Deut 18:15-19, Moses prophesies of another prophet—the ultimate Prophet to come who is the Messiah. Like Moses, He would receive and preach divine revelation and He would lead His people (John 6:14; 7:40).</p>
<h3>
Practical application
</h3>
<p>
The book of Deuteronomy underscores the importance of God’s Word. It is a vital part of our lives. Although we are no longer under the Old Testament law, we are still responsible to submit to the will of God in our lives. Simple obedience brings blessing, and sin has its own consequences.</p>
<p>
None of us is “above the law.” Even Moses, the leader and prophet chosen by God, was required to obey. The reason that he was not allowed to enter the Promised Land was that he disobeyed the Lord’s clear command (Num 20:13).</p>
<p>
During the time of His testing in the wilderness, Jesus quoted from the book of Deuteronomy three times (Matt 4). In so doing, Jesus illustrated for us the necessity of hiding God’s Word in our hearts that we might not sin against Him (Psa 119:11).</p>
<p>
As Israel remembered God’s faithfulness, so should we. The crossing of the Red Sea, the holy presence at Sinai, and the blessing of manna in the desert should be an encouragement to us as well. A great way to keep going forward is to take some time to look back and see what God has done.</p>
<p>
We also have a beautiful picture in Deuteronomy of a loving God Who desires a relationship with His children. the Lord names love as the reason that He brought Israel out of Egypt “with a mighty hand and redeemed you" </font>
(Deut 7:7-9). What a wonderful thing to be free from the bondage of sin and loved by an all-powerful God!</p>
