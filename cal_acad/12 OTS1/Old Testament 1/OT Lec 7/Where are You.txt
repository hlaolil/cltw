<h3>
Adam and Eve hide from God
</h3>
<p>
God came as usual in the cool of the day to fellowship with Adam and Eve, but they withdrew. This is the hard fact that man withdrew from God, not God from man. It is clear that man tried hide from God, and yet he could not. <br>The created could not divorce itself from his Creator.<br>
These two sinners could not escape the presence of God, and when called responded honestly, <font color= "blue">"... I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself". (Gen. 3:8-10)</font><br> When we come in contact with God face to face we are left with no defence. Isaiah, the prophet of God, cried, <font color= "blue">"Woe is me!, for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclear lips; for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts." (Isa 6:5)</font> <br>The holiness of God exposes our sin and deep down we know we have no defence.
<h3>
Adam and Eve attempt Self-Justification
</h3>
<p>
When questioned by God as to how they knew they were naked and asked <br><font color= "blue">Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you that you should not eat?” (Gen 3:11)</font> <br>Both Adam and Eve tried to justify their action by passing the blame.<br>

Adam, pleaded is was the fault of the woman, <font color= "blue">"... whom You gave to be with me, ...". (Gen 3:12)</font> It seems Adam was indirectly blaming God.<br> As if, if God had not given him the woman he would not have sinned. However, Adam was not deceived as noted earlier. He with full knowledge wilfully disobeyed God. <br>Eve, followed Adam's example and said <font color= "blue">“The serpent deceived me, and I ate.” (Gen 3:13)</font></p>
<p>
Since the Fall it has never helped anyone to blame someone else for our own shortcomings. When we try to justify our actions we are denying our guilt. <br>It is avoiding reality by not facing sin. All the while we are busy trying to justify ourselves we are delaying the cure to the problem. All who come to Christ must plead "guilty". We must accept our responsibility for our actions, and throw ourselves on the mercy of God.</p>
<h3>
The Judgements of God for the Serpent
</h3>
<p>
God must judge sin. Without responsibility for our actions the law is invalid.<br> God made the serpent a perpetual example to man of the Fall. The serpent lost its place as the "most subtle" of all the beasts of the field and made the lowest. It would crawl on its belly from that day forward. The judgement and effects of sin extended not only to the serpent but to all the animal kingdom. (Gen 3:14) (See Jer. 12:4, Rom. 8:20)<br>

Further, God said there would be "enmity" between the serpent and woman.<br> The curse goes much deeper than just establishing an ill feeling between woman and serpents. It was addressed to Satan himself. Man would not be Satan's willing ally and the seed of woman, referring ultimately to Christ, would crush the head of Satan which is a fatal blow. Satan's power would be only to cripple mankind, and not be able to destroy it. (Gen 3:15)
<h3>
The Judgement of God for the Woman
</h3>
<p>
God's judgement on woman was that her sorrow and conception be multiplied. The result of sin was that the length and pain of child birth was increased.

Further, the woman would have a strong desire to rule over her husband, however her husband would rule over her. Having overstepped the bounds of her position and responsibility, she would be mastered by him. She would always be in subjection to man, and in her carnal nature, never be satisfied with this situation. (Gen 3:16)
<h3>
The Judgement of God for the Man
</h3>
<p>
Man's sin brought the judgement of having to toil and have great hardships in making a livelihood. The same word which describes the pain of women in childbirth is used her to describe man's pain in labouring for a living.<br>

The life of man would be one of hard work caused by "thorns and thistles" indicating that even the plants of earth were adversely effected by man's sin. After a hard life man would die and be returned to the dust from which he was formed. (Gen 3:17-19)
<h3>
Adam names Woman
</h3>
<p>
Trusting is the promises of God that one would come who would restore fellowship with God and destroy the work of Satan, Adam named his wife, Eve. The name means "life", she was to be the mother of the human race.<br>

This statement absolutely refutes any concept of theistic evolution. <font color= "blue">And Adam called his wife’s name Eve, because she was the mother of all living. (Gen 3:20)</font> God did not evolve men from lower creatures.
<h3>
God's provision for Sinful Man
</h3>
<p>

Adam and Eve, must have been greatly repentant of their deeds which had brought sin into the world. God in his mercy made provision for them made them coats of animal skins for them to wear. Earlier they had made themselves fig leaves to hide their nakedness, however their efforts were lacking.<br>
The word "covering" also means "atonement". Most see this act of God as being more than just providing clothes, but as an act of God's Grace in providing atonement from sin as well. They responded in their hearts to God and trusted Him, God in turn accepted their faith and saved them<br>
There was shedding of blood, as a picture of the coming of Christ and His shedding His blood to atone for the sins of all mankind. Animals were killed and their skins used for a "covering" for man.<br>
The Garden of Eden continued on for some time after the Fall, maybe even until the Great Flood. However, God drove Adam and Eve from this special place prepared for them and sent them into a harsh world to hack out a living by the sweat of their brow. The would no longer have be able to take of the fruit of the tree of life that grew in the garden. The result of sin was death. God had warned them it would be so. Now cut off from the source of everlasting life they face a sure and certain future death.<br>
God placed Cherubims with flaming swords to protect the entrance into the Garden and Adam and Eve never again returned to it. (Gen 3:21)<br>

Man's death was spiritual as well as physical. When he sinned he died spiritually being cut off from the source of life, who is God. In time sin works its way and all men eventually die. Rom 6, says, <font color= "blue">"The wages of sin is death ...". (Rom 6:23)</font> Man is given time; time to live experience life and also to seek God and be saved.</p>
<p>
As we close Gen 3, the record of the Fall of Man, the picture looks bleak. <br>But we have the promise of God, in Gen 3:15, man had forsaken God, but God had not forsaken man. The Saviour was promised and He would come and all that would by faith accept God's provision for atonement would not be taken in the "second" death, that being eternal separation from God in Hell's fires. <br>The message is one of man's failure and God's demonstrated mercy to save the sinner gone astray.
