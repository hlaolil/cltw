The Consequences of Disobeying God
</h1>
<p>
The Holy Scriptures State that if we are obedient, then we shall receive goodness from the Lord, but our  disobedience to God will lead to consequences of adversity. It’s a terrible thing to disobey God.  
<br>There have been plenty of persons mentioned in the Bible who thought they were a lot smarter than God, and who chose to do things their way over God’s way. This led to severe negative consequences for them.

Adam and Eve

Adam and Eve lived together in a perfect Paradise, what the Bible calls the Garden of Eden, until they disobeyed God by eating fruit from the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. This act of sin, caused “The Fall”. <br>
From this comes our separation from God, painful childbirth, weeds in our garden, and, ultimately, death. Moreover, Adam and Eve’s disobedience introduced fear and alienation even death  into humankind’s formerly perfect relationships with God and one another</p>
