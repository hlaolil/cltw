The Old Testament Tabernacle and instructions
</h2>
<h3>
A Look at The Old Testament Tabernacle
</h3>
<p>
You can read the detailed instructions for the Old Testament church tabernacle starting in Exodus chapter 25. God gives the instructions on how to build and of what materials to be used in the construction of His home the tabernacle where they are to meet with Him. He also gives explicit instructions on how meet with Him, what He expects from them and how to prepare etc in complete detail.</p>
<h3>
The Priesthood 
</h3>
<p>
You can read of the appointment and all about the priesthood, their duties, their garments and how they are to perform their duties of the old testament in complete detail beginning in Exodus chapter 28.</p>
<h3>
The Church
</h3>
<p>
The church was actually the temple (tabernacle). The building made with Hands. The place where they had to come to meet with God, through the priesthood. They could not approach God on their own.</p>
<h3>
The People
</h3>
<p>
The old testament congregation was made up of the nation of Israel and a few others were allowed to become part of it. Very few. See the law for details</p>
<h3>
Manner of Meetings
</h3>
<p>
Starting in Exodus chapter 25 you can see all the explicit and complete details of the priesthood, their raiment, the instruments, the sacrifices and all the details of when where, and how the service of the tabernacle is to be performed. It is too lengthy to be shown in detail here but you should read it if you are not familiar with all of it. The important thing to understand here is that God gives complete details of when, where, why, how and by whom He desires to be served. All this, of course, changed when the new testament was begun, but since God is the same yesterday, today and forever we can expect the same level of detail under this covenant as well.</p>
<h3>
Sacrifices
</h3>
<p>
Beginning in chapter 27 of Exodus you can read all about the required sacrifices. And again the thing to understand here is that all the details are given by God Himself.</p>
<h3>
God's throne among the people of Israel.
</h3>
<p>
God had a sort of throne in the most Holy place where He lived, the mercy seat on top of the ark of the covenant. (Ex 25:10-22)</p>
<h3>
The home of God among the people of Israel.
</h3>
<p>
Note that God lived in a portable building built by the hands of men and to meet with Him you had to go to where the temple currently was located. You also could not approach Him for yourself, you had to go through men, the priests. Only those of the tribe of Levi could serve the Lord. Those of the ministry (priesthood) were required to do the work of the ministry.</p>
<h3>
The atonement for sins of the priests and the people.
</h3>
<p>
Note that atonement (forgiveness of sins) was only possible once a year and if the “man” priest was not acceptable that day to God the sins would not be forgiven. In fact there was a cord tied to the leg of the priest that entered the most Holy place with God, to be used to pull his body out if God killed him. This was not salvation, only the forgiveness of sins. It could not make one righteous as Christ does.

Also notice that is says this is a “statute forever”, the word used here does not mean eternally, it means for an indefinite period, which in this case is until the death of Christ as the law will be done at that time and since it is to be completely fulfilled, no part of it shall remain.(Lev 16:29-34)
<h3>
Salvation
</h3>
<p>
In the old testament, salvation was by faith as it is in the new testament. 
Salvation is and always has been and always will be, a free gift by the Grace of God , received by belief and trust and adherence to Christ and His Gospel.

For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes. (Rom 10:3-4 )

The law could not bring salvation, it was designed to point them to Christ. We look back at Christ the Saviour and they looked forward to Him. The entire law points to the free gift of salvation only available through Christ the messiah. No man could fulfil the entire law so no man could be justified by it and it tells us that. Faith in Christ is the only Way. Now that Christ has come there is no need for the law which pointed to Him as the coming redeemer. Now all can look back to His coming as it has brought all that was promised.</p>
<h3>
Duration of The Covenant
</h3>
<p>
The Law of Moses was given for a certain period of time. It was temporary, never was it intended to last beyond the death of Christ. Look at the above scripture, check your bible, it was to be in effect from the time it was given to Moses only until the death of Christ on the cross. At His resurrection the new and eternal covenant was to begin. As in the born again experience of the Christian, the Kingdom of God that was brought by Christ made “all things new”. The entire law was Finished and done away with and a brand new and totally different manner of relating to God was instituted. Nothing of the old was retained, it was fulfilled and therefore finished forever.</p>

The New Testament Tabernacle and instructions
</h2>
<h3>
A Look at The Instructions For Jesus' Church 
</h3>
<p>
He and The original apostles have given us the pattern for His church just as God gave the Israelites the pattern for the Old Testament church. If we have eyes to see and ears to hear and a heart to obey, we find He gives us instruction on what and how to do everything that is important to Him. The Tabernacle (temple), The Priesthood (Clergy), Manner of Meetings, Sacrifices, God's Home on earth, Holidays and how to Celebrate them, Atonement, Salvation, Duration</p>
<h3>
The Tabernacle
</h3>
<p>
Remember, The tabernacle is God's home with man on the earth. Where in the old testament He was on the mercy seat in the little room (most Holy place or Holy of Holies) in the tabernacle (a Building made with hands), it is different in the new testament.</p>
<p>
And Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and breathed His last. Then the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom. (Mark 15:37-39)</p>
<p>
When Jesus died the veil (the covering to the entrance to the most Holy place where the presence of God resided ) was supernaturally torn in two, God was exposed, let out of the box where He resided under the old testament. It was the beginning of the new covenant. No longer is God going to live in the tabernacle made with hands, He is no longer confined to a single location inside a temple made with hands. No longer must we depend on men to go to God for us. No longer do we have to go to where the tabernacle is, He is with us always.</p>
<p>
Do you not know that you are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God dwells in you? If anyone defiles the temple of God, God will destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which temple you are. (1 Cor 3:16-17)</p>
<p>
Remember, “where two or more are gathered in His name there He is in the midst of them. We can meet anywhere, any time, with or without notice. He will be there, in a home, at the beach, the coffee shop, at work, in a warehouse, He does not care, all He cares is that we invite Him to be the leader and Lord and He will meet us there. We are His abode, He goes with us if we allow Him to.</p>
<h3>
The Priesthood (Clergy) - New Testament Ministries
</h3>
<p>
Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually. And God has appointed these in the church: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, after that miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, varieties of tongues. (1 Cor 12:27-29)</p>
<p>
Do you notice He did not appoint them “Over” anything or anyone, He appointed them “in the church”. Those appointed/Given to the body of Christ are members individually as are all, not above or more important, not “in charge” or “in control”but entrusted with special giftings to be used to bring the whole body of Christ into “the stature of the fullness of Christ”, thereby requiring them to become true servants of all and not lords or masters as so many believe. They are not appointed to stand and tell everyone what to do but are supposed to teach , by example and word how to become doers of the word. To allow all to minister as the Spirit leads. How to be servants and meet the needs of all. Today's “ministry” for the most part believe that they are to stand and preach at “their” people who are “under their control”. They think they are to do the ministering while the regular people look on. But scriptures say that is not their job. In the new testament there is NO clergy-Laity. All are equal and all are able to access God directly without need of a “clergy” . In fact those who are to minister to the others are required to be servants to all and must lower themselves to be true servants to the brethren.</p>
<p>
The work of the ministry, the bringing of the lost to Christ, the healing , the baptising etc. (the work of the ministry, not the work of the “church” or of a pastor) “the work of the ministry” is to be done by all the saints and the job of those called to the specific ministries (they are ministries that men do and are not Positions, or Titles as some suppose), is setting the example of servant hood and bringing the rest of the saints to “the fullness of the Gospel of Christ. </p>
<p>
He specifically states they are not to be “over” or “In Control” of anyone. But prideful men continue to believe what the schools of “the churches of men “ teach instead of learning the truth from the scriptures with the help of the Holy Spirit. They serve as hirelings in the “churches of men” and believe and teach they are serving the “church of Christ” but Christ and His Spirit are far from them. These “churches” are the fruit of men that have no knowledge of the truths of scripture and bring “their” people (yes their people because God is not with them) into a bondage of meetings and programs and all the man made nonsense that has nothing to do with the true church of Jesus Christ. </p>
<p>
Jesus set us free from bondage and He has no desire for us to be brought back into bondage of any kind. The true church of Christ serves as He directs through His Holy Spirit and does so as an act of love by hearing from Him and following His direction, not that of some mere deluded man with a plan. True leadership is seldom seen but the evidence of their presence is always evident. There is no such thing in scripture as a pastor, check your scriptures, that is something men do for other saints, it is a ministry and is not a “position' nor is it a “title”.</p>
<p>
The great apostle shows the example, he always says Paul called to be an apostle or Paul, a bond servant, and never does he assume it to be a title. There is no such thing as apostle John or pastor Fred. These ministries are the opposite of what the “churches of men” want you to believe. All ministries are to assume the lowliest place in the true church. Ministry, as Christ shows us is a position of servitude. There are to be no men lifted up above others, all who assume leadership roles are to be bond servants of all. Any man calling himself by any title other than brother or his own name does not understand scripture and is not qualified to lead. Note, God gave the ministries to the church, he did not give the church to the ministries. we are warned in scripture to beware of hirelings, those that are paid to minister and do it a a job, not as true ministry does, as a work of love. Hirelings always require a title.</p>
<p>
Notice again that the ministry was given to the church and the reasons for it. The only true ministries in the new testament are men that are filled with and led by the Holy Spirit and leading, training and releasing the brethren as they are prepared to fulfil their ministries. Their mission is “ I do not seek My own will but the will of the Father who sent Me.” (John 5:30) They have no desire to build anything but the unseen Kingdom of God.</p>
<p>
No one can be planted in any location if they are free to follow the Holy Spirit of God. Nothing in the Kingdom is permanent all is continuing forward in preparation to the last days. To be truly a part we must hear from the Holy Spirit and do His will, not the will of men.</p>
<p>
There is only one church of Jesus Christ and only one leader of it, His Holy Spirit.</p>
<h3>
The Church
</h3>
<p>
Is the people. Gods abode is in His people so they do not have to go anywhere to meet Him. He is always with them. His temple (tabernacle) is no longer a building made with hands. The old has passed away and all things have become new.</p>
<h3>
The People
</h3>
<p>
The new testament church is made up of “whosoever will”. Any person that is willing to repent and accept Jesus sacrifice as his own and follow Him is welcome and becomes a part of the church of Christ. It requires that we recognise that all things have become new, the old has passed way and we are a New Creation in Him,. No membership cards, no secret pledge, no submission to or permission from men required. Just submission to Christ. It is the beginning of a Spiritual journey and is not something you do once and then go on living your life as you wish. It is a lifelong journey and those who endure to the end SHALL be saved. He has bought us and we belong to Him and not to ourself. Therefore we must continuously hear from and follow Him if we claim to be Christians (His people). Otherwise we are liars and the truth is not in us</p>
<h3>
Manner of Meetings
</h3>
<p>
The manner of meeting when saints come together is not written on a sheet of paper or a board in front for all to read. The meeting of the true saints of the church of Jesus Christ will understand the plan that scripture has laid out and will understand that the meeting is to be led by the Holy Spirit and because of this can move in any direction as , if and when He says. In over 40 years I have never seen a meeting that was truly led by His Spirit that did not at some point take a turn in direction.</p>
<h3>
The Sacrifices
</h3>
<p>
There are no further sacrifices necessary in the true church of Christ. He made them for us and all we have to do is accept His sacrifice as being ours as He tells us.</p>
<h3>
God's Throne on Earth
</h3>
<p>
God does not have a throne on earth, He lives in us , and He is everywhere and anywhere His people are. We can approach Him without going before His throne, all we have to do is speak because He lives in us. We are His tabernacle and throne room and we are never alone.</p>
<p>
He has a throne somewhere in the heavens from which He will judge all mankind when this earthly dispensation comes to an end.</p>
<h3>
Atonement
</h3>
<p>
No longer do we have to depend on a mere man to go before God in our behalf on that one day of the year. Under the new testament Jesus paid the price for all of our trespasses and sins to be erased and all we have to do as Christians is repent and ask His forgiveness and we become clean again. And day any time any place. Its between us and God . Of course if we have offended or hurt a brother then we must also make that right as well.</p>

If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. (1 John 1:8-10)
Note that it says God desires all men to be saved and that it also says through him many will be made righteous . Not all will be saved and not all will be made righteous, only those that will repent and meet the scriptural requirements will be made righteous. (be saved).</p>
<h3>
Duration
</h3>
<p>
This new covenant is eternal, From the death of Christ to eternity-- Forever Never Ending. Unlike the old covenant that was given for a specific time period ( from Moses until Christ) the new covenant has no end.</p>
<h3>
Salvation
</h3>
<p>
Salvation is now open to all that will repent and accept the atonement that was paid for by Christ on the cross. It is a free gift, ours for the taking by meeting the requirements sent forth in scripture.</p>
<h3>
God's Home on Earth
</h3>
<p>
We, the new testament saints are God's home on earth until the judgement. Then after it we the saints of God will inherit the earth. Then at some point, in an instant there will be a new heaven and a new earth and we will spend eternity there with Him.</p>
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
There is only one true church of Jesus Christ. It has no denominations (schisms and divisions). It has no clergy. Its headquarters is at the throne of God in heaven and not in a building made with hands on earth. In it all are equal but some have been called to a greater servant hood. There are no Men in Charge, it is led by the Holy Spirit</p>
<p>
It has no permanent location. God is with it. It is eternal.</p>
<p>
The current “church” system is an attempt by men to re-invent the Old Testament Tabernacle ) temple- church) into a vehicle for them to be lifted up and have control over people. The Old Testament Tabernacle was part of the law and was done away with as was the rest of the law when its time was finished. (Remember it was only in effect from Moses until the death of Christ)</p>
<p>
The true church is the People who belong to and follow Jesus Christ without reservation and nothing more.</p>
