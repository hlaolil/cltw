Somebody out of a Nobody
</h1>
<p>
The problem with discovering the historical Moses is one common to religious heroes. All we really know about him comes from the Bible and nowhere else. He appears first in the book of Exodus, wrapped in a wonderful story about his birth and upbringing. <br>A king, or Pharaoh, had arisen in Egypt "who knew not Joseph," a Hebrew whose influence in Egypt had encouraged peace between the peoples <br>(See Joseph in Genesis). <br>The Hebrews, so blessed at the end of Genesis, had, four hundred years later, fallen on hard times. Forced to serve as slaves living in the Egyptian ghetto town known as Goshen, they were punished severely if their daily quota of brick-making fell short.</p>
<h3>
Moses in Egypt
</h3>
<p>
When Pharaoh ordered that the first-born sons of the Jewish slaves be killed, Moses' father and mother, Amram and Jochebed, gave him up to the hands of either fate or God. In the hope that someone would find the baby Moses and raise him, they wrapped him in swaddling clothes, placed him in a basket, and set him adrift on the Nile River.
Moses' sister kept careful watch on his progress downstream.<br> It happened that Pharaoh's daughter was bathing at that moment and noticed the basket floating on the current. She did what many people do when picking up a helpless baby. She fell in love. She must have known that it was a Hebrew baby. And she must have suspected something was up when Moses' sister showed up just in time to tell her she knew of someone, Moses' mother, who was both willing and able to nurse the baby until he was old enough to move into Pharaoh's house.</p>
<p>
Whatever happened-and the Bible characteristically leaves us free to decide for ourselves, thus guaranteeing endless centuries of people sitting around tables studying scripture-Moses was raised in the court of the king and grew to be one of the most important men in Egypt.<br>
Therein lies one of the problems concerning Moses and the historical record. Egyptians have always been very good about recording history, especially the history of their kings. But there is no mention of Moses or the Hebrew people. None at all. Anywhere. Not even a defaced statue or a stray cuneiform tablet. Some explain Moses' absence by surmising that Egypt wasn't likely to record for posterity the humiliation of a Pharaoh who raised a very ungrateful Moses as his own. Others point out that one would at least expect to find that someone rewrote the story, slanting it in a way that would defend Pharaoh and cast aspersions on "Moses the ingrate," especially in light of what happens next in the story.</p>
<p>
So far, all we have to go on is an account written possibly years, and more probably centuries, after the event. And any lawyer could persuade a jury that the testimony of the scriptures, written perhaps by Moses and certainly by Jewish authors, was biased toward the Hebrew point of view. But the tradition is so strong it refuses to go away. So it becomes, like so many other religious points of view, a matter of faith.<br>
At any rate, Moses grew to adulthood thinking himself a very important person. But blood is thicker than Egyptian privilege. When Moses was about forty years old, he underwent a severe mid-life crisis. Seeing an Egyptian taskmaster beating a Hebrew slave, he was outraged and killed the Egyptian. Burying the body in the sands of the desert, he hoped the incident would pass unnoticed.
Of course, it didn't. A day later he became the talk of Goshen. Everyone knew what he had done. Moses was forced to flee for his life.<br> In those days, you simply didn't defend Hebrew slaves. The thinking was that it tended to set a bad example.</p>
<h3>
Moses in Midian
</h3>
<p>
So Moses went "home"-to the place where his ancestors had lived. <br>He fled to Midian, where he spent another forty years tending the sheep of Jethro, the man whose daughter, Zipporah, became Moses' wife.<br>Jethro is called "a priest of Midian," and here we find ourselves treading on some pretty believable historical ground. Given the subsequent warlike history between Israel and Midian, it's a fairly safe bet that later scribes wouldn't have invented a Midianite period for their beloved Moses unless such a story was widely believed to have been true. So if Moses really existed, chances are he stayed for a while in Midian.<br>
Forty years, to be exact. We now have two periods consisting of one of the Bible's favourite symbolic numbers. Forty years in Egypt, forty years in Midian. But all quiet times come to an end in heroes' stories. And Moses was about to begin another forty-year period, the most important of his life.</p>
<h3>
Moses finds out he is not a Someboby but a Nobody
</h3>
<p>
Someone once said that Moses spent<img src="../../../images/content/burning_bush.jpg" width="200" 

height="210" hspace="10" vspace="0" border="0" align="right" 

alt=""> forty years thinking he was a somebody, forty years learning he was a nobody, and forty years discovering what God could do with a nobody. And it began in the most unlikely of places.<br> If you were inventing this story, how could you ever think up a scenario in which Moses hears the voice of God coming out of a bush that "burned, but was not consumed"? This is a real sticking point for Moses' detractors. The idea, which is so far-fetched it seems as though it must be a human invention, defies critical analysis just because it is so radical. <br>Who would make up something like this if they wanted the story to appear believable?<br>
But the Bible insists that it was by means of a burning bush that God gave Moses his marching orders, instructing Moses to tell Pharaoh to let God's people go. Moses was reluctant at first and full of excuses, pointing out that he was not a good speaker. God told him to bring his brother, Aaron, as his spokesperson. Moses finally agreed.</p>
<h3>
The Exodus
</h3>
<p>
And so it began-the story retold every year by Jewish families celebrating Passover, perhaps the most famous liberation story ever told. <br>It's called the Exodus.<br>
Moses travelled to Egypt to appear before the family that had raised him. Standing before Pharaoh, he declared God's intention to free the Israelites. Ten times Moses said, "Let my people go." Ten times Pharaoh refused.<br> Ten times God sent plagues upon Egypt-the plagues that are recounted at every contemporary Passover celebration. The Nile was turned into blood. Frogs, gnats, and flies infested the land. Livestock died; boils broke out upon the people. Hail and locusts took their toll. Darkness covered the land. <br>And still Pharaoh refused to release his slave labourers.</p>
<p>
Finally the terrible tenth plague reaped its harvest. The first born of Egypt were killed by the angel of death. The Hebrew people had been warned, and those that heeded the word of God were prepared. They had carefully followed instructions that are, to this very day, remembered in symbol and story each Passover. A lamb had been slaughtered and roasted. Its blood had been sprinkled on the door posts and lintels of every Jewish house. The people were dressed for travel and had baked desert bread, unleavened bread, so they would be sustained on their journey into the wilderness.</p>
<p>
Finally the moment of death was upon Egypt. Not even Pharaoh's first born son was spared. But as the Hebrew people listened to the eerie sounds of death spread from house to house throughout the land, they were spared when the angel of death, seeing the blood of the sacrificed lamb, "passed over" each Jewish home (hence the name of the Passover holiday) and went on to reap its deadly harvest.</p>
<p>
Morning brought the glad news. They were free. They headed out toward the rising sun.<br>
Upon reaching the Red Sea, however, they looked back to see that Pharaoh had changed his mind. The Egyptian soldiers in their chariots were in hot pursuit. The waters lay before the fleeing Jews. The armies were closing in from behind. Trapped between hammer and anvil, what could they do?<br>
Moses showed them what to do, now and forever. "Trust in God!" was the message. "Have faith!" was the theme of the sermon. This moment was to be indelibly stamped upon their national memory and remembered when they later faced Assryian hoards, Babylonian armies, Roman butchers, and Nazi murderers.</p>
<p>
"Remember this moment," said God.<br>
And the impossible happened. With no hope in sight, they were forced to trust God. What they saw that day cemented them forever as the people of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob-the chosen people of God.<br> Moses stepped forward all alone and held up his staff. That's all. <br>No incantations. No rituals. No elaborate preparations.<br> Just acknowledge God and step back. Watch Him go to work.</p>
<p>
And the waters parted. Impossibly,<img src="../../../images/content/images.jpg" width="200" 

height="210" hspace="10" vspace="0" border="0" align="right" 

alt="">  the people found a path where a moment before there had been none. They crossed through on dry land. And with no human effort, with no human intervention at all, they were saved while Pharaoh and his armies drowned.</p>
<p>
"Remember this moment," said God. And they did. Every year at Passover they still remember.<br>
The story grew with the retelling. And therein lies the problem, at least for the literal minded. Did it ever happen? And if it did, did it happen like this?<br>
Scholars are sceptical. The earliest account of the Exodus, they point out, doesn't mention Moses at all:<br><font color= "blue">
Sing to the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously!
The horse and its rider He has thrown into the sea! (Ex 15:21)</font><br>
And the ancient creed of Israel is similarly silent concerning the presence of Moses:<font color= "blue">
But the Egyptians mistreated us, afflicted us, and laid hard bondage on us. Then we cried out to the Lord God of our fathers, and the Lord heard our voice and looked on our affliction and our labour and our oppression. So the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm, with great terror and with signs and wonders. (Deut 26:6-8)</font></p>
<h3>
The Wilderness and the Promised Land
</h3>
<p>
Before Moses could lead the people into the Promised Land, they had to undergo basic training. For forty years they wandered in the wilderness. This is really where the religion of Judaism began.</p>
<p> Moses received the law-both the Ten Commandments and the written law of Leviticus. Some ancient rabbis taught that Moses received a secret law as well, whispered in his ear by God himself. This law was passed on through Joshua to the scholars of later generations, who interpreted it and formed the rich oral traditions of Judaism.<br> Plans for the great Temple were given in triplicate. The book of Exodus has God telling Moses how to build it, Moses telling the people what God said, and then a description of exactly how the instructions were carried out.<br>
Ritual sacrifice began. Lessons were learned. Through it all, Moses built his reputation as prophet, priest, judge, lawgiver, intercessor, victor, exile, fugitive, shepherd, guide, healer, miracle worker, man of God, and rebel.</p>
<p>
One psalmist wrote:<font color= "blue">
He made known His ways to Moses, His acts to the children of Israel. (Psa 103:7)</font></p>
<p>
One would think Moses would be given a hero's welcome into the Promised Land, carried there by ranks of heavenly hosts. But such was not the case. Moses, it seems, like all biblical heroes, had feet of clay. He never entered Canaan at all. And it wasn't a tragic accident that frustrated him.<br> It was a punishment sent from God.</p>
<p>
In Num 20, Moses had been told to give water to the people by speaking to a rock and calling forth the water. Instead, in his anger at the people for rebelling continually, he rather petulantly whacked the rock with his staff. Water came forth, all right, but Moses apparently angered God by not following directions.</p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"Go up this mountain ... and die on the mountain which you ascend, and be gathered to your people, just as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people; because you trespassed against Me among the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah Kadesh, in the Wilderness of Zin, because you did not hallow Me in the midst of the children of Israel" (Deut 32:49-51)</font>.</p>
<p>
By this time in the story, after reading four books of the Bible, most readers are definitely on Moses' side and are appalled that God could be so strict in his judgement. After all Moses had done, couldn't God cut him some slack and let him set foot in the Holy Land at least once?"
Apparently not. God is a strict judge, and holiness is as holiness does. Moses got to look at Canaan, the Promised Land, from afar, but he wasn't allowed to set foot there.</p>
<p>
God does give him a great obituary, though.
<font color= "blue">But since then there has not arisen in Israel a prophet like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face, in all the signs and wonders which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt, before Pharaoh, before all his servants, and in all his land, and by all that mighty power and all the great terror which Moses performed in the sight of all Israel.<br>(Deut 34:10-12)</font></p>
<h3>
Moses' Influence
</h3>
<p>
So what is the lesson? It's not always the arriving that's most important. Sometimes the prize is in the journey itself. Moses changed the very fabric of Jewish thought. He not only freed the people from captivity, he set them on the road to becoming the first great monotheistic religion.</p>
<p>
Christians also put a different spin on why Moses couldn't enter the Promised Land himself. Moses represents the law-the Old Testament. It leads the way but cannot save anyone, according to Christian theology. Only grace can do that. So Moses, the law, leads people to a view of heaven but is not sufficient to let them enter.<br>

Christians even look to a future appearance, bringing him back to finish what he started. In Matt 17 he steps out of the pages of history to council Jesus atop the Mount of Transfiguration. In Rev 11, though not mentioned by name, he appears to duplicate the miracle of turning water into blood, preparing the way for the Second Coming of Christ.<br>
Perhaps these appearances are appropriate for one who died a suspicious death. All we learn from Deuteronomy is that Moses was buried by the hand of God somewhere in the mountains. In the New Testament book of Jude we read a strange passage about the archangel Michael "disputing with the devil about the body of Moses."</p>
<p>
The following words are attributed to Moses:<br><font color= "blue">
Lord, you have been our dwelling place throughout all generations. Before the mountains were born or you brought forth the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting you are God. ... And let the beauty of the Lord our God be upon us, and establish the work of our hands for us;. (Psa 90:1-2,17)</font>
