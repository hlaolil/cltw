<h1>
The Faith of Abraham
</h1>
<p>
For an overview of what will be covered in this chapter, read Gen 12–25.</p>
<p>
Abraham is without question one of the outstanding individuals of the Old Testament. God spoke to him personally, visited him in his home and even considered him a friend. And Abraham loved God. He obeyed Him, served Him, and was even willing to sacrifice his son to prove his faith. Abraham is a biblical superhero, richly deserving a place in the Old Testament Hall of Fame. But are his experiences something you can personally relate to?</p>

<h3>
 Abraham
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to the place which he would receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going." (Heb 11:8).</font>
Abraham may seem superhuman, but if we look more closely at some of the incidents in his life we’ll see someone like the rest of us, with many frailties and weaknesses. He eventually became someone who<font color= "blue"> “believed the Lord, and he accounted it to him as righteousness” (Gen 15:6).</font></p>
<p>
But Abraham wasn’t born that way. He had to grow and learn by experience. In Gen 12, God told Abraham to uproot himself and his family from their familiar surroundings and move to a new land. It was a test of faith and obedience for a 75-year-old man. Abraham did as he was told. <font color= "blue">"he went out, not knowing where he was going” (Heb 11:8).</font> 
On this occasion Abraham trusted God. But Abraham wasn’t perfect.</p>
<p>
Read the rest of Gen 12. Isn’t this a rather strange thing for a man of faith to have done? Abraham’s wife, Sarah, even at her age, was so attractive that other men were taken with her beauty. Abraham was concerned that some might even consider killing him so that Sarah would be available to marry. Fearing for his life, Abraham deceived Pharaoh into believing his beautiful wife was his sister.</p>
<p>
Earlier, Abraham had trusted God. But in this chapter we see Abraham acting first in faith, and then in fear. Even though Abraham was a man of faith, he was an imperfect human.</p>
<p>
Read the accounts of Abraham’s relationship with his nephew, Lot. Note how Abraham preferred peace to strife in the incident recorded in Gen 13:5-12. Lot took advantage of his uncle’s desire for peace, and chose what he thought was the best territory. It was a decision that rebounded. Lot and his family settled in a disputed area and became caught up in local wars. In Gen 14:12-16, Lot was taken prisoner, and we read how Abraham went to his rescue.</p>
<p>
Abraham’s love of peace, mixed with loyalty and courage, is an impressive quality. He was indeed a man learning to live up to God’s standards. But he had not yet fully learned to trust in God.</p>
<p>
God had made important promises to Abraham regarding his descendants. The problem was, Abraham didn’t yet have any descendants. Sarah was barren, and she and Abraham were well past the age they could expect to have children. In Genesis 15:1-3, Abraham explained this situation to God. But God insisted that eventually they would have a son who would inherit the promises.</p>
<p>
Instead of waiting in faith, Abraham and Sarah took matters into their own hands (Gen 16:1-4). Their impatience produced much unhappiness for Abraham, Sarah and her maid, Hagar. Hagar’s experiences are recorded in some detail in the Bible. They provide us with a touching example of God’s compassion and mercy for the oppressed (Gen 16:5-16; 21:9-21). But we learn from this that God does not always spare us from the consequences of our lack of faith.</p>
<p>
It is a lesson that is often repeated throughout the Bible. Although sin is forgiven, the physical consequences are often still felt. It was a lesson even Abraham had to learn the hard way. Abraham and Sarah had to wait many more years for their son and heir. Finally, when Abraham was 100 and Sarah 90 (Gen 17:17), the time had come. The New Testament book of Hebrews tells us: <font color= "blue">“By faith Sarah herself also received strength to conceive seed, and she bore a child when she was past the age, because she judged Him faithful who had promised” (Heb 11:11).</font></p>
<p>
So the final verdict was that Abraham and Sarah did wait in faith. But Genesis reminds us that their faith was mixed with a strong dose of human doubt and misgivings (Gen 17:15-19; 18:10-15). Eventually a son, Isaac, was born to Abraham and Sarah (Gen 21:1-3). Sometime later came the great test of Abraham’s life. God told him to travel to a distant mountain and offer Isaac as a sacrifice (Gen 22:1-2).</p>
<h3>
 The angel of the Lord stops Abraham 
</h3>
<p>
"They came to the place of which God had told him. And Abraham built an altar there and placed the wood in order; and he bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar, upon the wood. And Abraham stretched out his hand and took the knife to slay his son. <font color= "blue">But the Angel of the Lord called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” So he said, “Here I am.” And He said, “Do not lay your hand on the lad, or do anything to him; for now I know that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only son, from Me.” (Gen 22:9-12)</font>.</p>
<p>
Put yourself in Abraham’s place. What conflicting emotions must have raged through his mind? Isaac was his long-promised heir. Why would God want him dead? Abraham had waited so long for a son, and now he would have to lose him.</p>
<p>
On the other hand, Abraham reasoned that God could raise Isaac from the dead. Had God not caused Isaac to be born from parents who, in terms of childbearing potential, were as good as dead? God had said the promises were to be fulfilled through Isaac. Abraham trusted and relied on God. He believed that God knew what He was doing (Heb 11:17-19).

As Paul wrote in his epistle to the Romans: <font color= "blue">“He did not waver at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God, and being fully convinced that what He had promised He was also able to perform.” (Rom 4:20-21)</font>.

God intervened at the last moment: <font color= "blue">“Now I know that you fear God, because you have not withheld from me your son, your only son” (Gen 22:12)</font>. And that is how we think of Abraham now – a great man of faith and courage who dedicated his life to seeking God’s will and fulfilling His purpose. But from the experiences recorded in the Bible, we can see that Abraham’s life was not one unbroken catalog of faith. There were ups and downs, moments of worry, doubt, indecision and frustration.</p>
<p>
The faith chapter in Hebrews reminds us that<font color= "blue"> “without faith it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.” (Heb 11:6)</font>.</p>
<h3>
 Sarah's burial
</h3>
<p>
Grieved and tottering, Abraham leans on Isaac as father and son lay Sarah to rest:<font color= "blue"> "Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah, before Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan" (Gen 23:19)</font>.
A life spent learning to obey God is like a journey, with a starting point, a route and a destination. For Abraham that journey began when he left his home to travel wherever God would lead him. He could not always know what route the journey would take. But he learned to trust in God to direct his steps.</p>
<p>
Your journey may not be as eventful as Abraham’s, but you can be sure there will be tests and trials, ups and downs, successes and failures along the way. We can all be encouraged by these examples from the life of the father of the faithful.</p>
<h3>
Learning to live by faith
</h3>
<p>
One does not learn to live by faith all at once. It doesn’t come naturally. We must learn, and, as we learn, we make mistakes. But those mistakes need not cut us off from God. He is a patient, compassionate and merciful teacher.</p>
<p>
Like all good teachers, He does not expect His students to fail. He will work with us, encourage us, and, yes, sometimes allow is to be tried and tested, <font color= "blue">"that the genuineness of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ. (1 Peter 1:7)<font> Indeed, God says, <font color= "blue">“Now the just shall live by faith; but if anyone draws back, My soul has no pleasure in him.” (Heb 10:38)</font>.</p>
<p>
But for those who do follow God in faith, there is the promise from Jesus Christ: <font color= "blue">“I will never leave you nor forsake you.” (Heb 13:5)</font>.</p>
