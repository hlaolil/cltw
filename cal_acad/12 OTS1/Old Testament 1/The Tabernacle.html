<h3>
Description of the Tabernacle 
</h3>
<p>
Chapters 25 to 40 of Exodus tell us much of what we know about the Tabernacle, the dwelling place of the Lord. <br>It was an oblong wooden building, covered with gold, and roofed over with cloth covered by animal skins. The building was about 14m long by 4.5m wide by 4.5m tall.</p>
<p>
The gold-covered boards from which the building was constructed stood upright, having two tenons (projections) on the bottom that were inserted in silver sockets placed on the ground.</p>
<p>
Four layers of material were thrown over these upright boards, forming the roof. The outside layer of material was badgers’ skins (probably dolphins’ or porpoises’ skins), so that the appearance of the sides and back (west end) of the Tabernacle was rough and plain.</p45>
<p>
There was a beautiful Veil made from blue, purple, scarlet and fine twisted linen, with cherubim skilfully worked into the material. The Veil hung inside the building on four gold-covered wooden posts standing on bases of silver.</p>
<p>
The Veil was placed two-thirds of the way toward the far end of the building, partitioning off a room cubical in proportion, 4.5m on a side. <br>This was the Holy of Holies, or Most Holy Place.

The remainder of the building was called the Holy. In English we add the word place, calling it the Holy Place.</p>
<p>
The Tabernacle building or Tent of Meeting, stood in an area referred to as the Court, or Courtyard, of the Tabernacle of the Congregation. The Court was surrounded by a fence of linen hung on posts, or pillars, standing on sockets of bronze. The fence of linen was about 45m long by 23m across by 2.2m high.</p>
<p>
The Tabernacle building was three times as long as it was wide, and it was as tall as it was wide. If you think of 4.5m wide, 4.5m high, and 14m long you will be close enough for the Tabernacle building itself.</p>
<p>
If you stood back at a distance you would gain the impression of a large fenced-off area, the fence being pure white linen. The building was twice as high as the fence and its appearance was plain and rough on the two sides and rear. The inside of the building was ornate and beautiful.</p>

<p>
The Glory of God Himself could be seen as He came down on the Tabernacle.
<p><font color= "blue">
Then a cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. And Moses was not able to enter the tabernacle of meeting, because the cloud rested above it, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. (Ex 40:34,35)</font></p>
<p>
The gate to the Courtyard of the Tabernacle was on the eastern side of the linen fence when the Ark of the Covenant was facing east. It was a curtain that hung from four pillars. The curtain that formed the gate of the Courtyard was about 9m wide and 2.2m tall—the same height as the rest of the fence.</p>
<p>
The gate was part of the fence that surrounded the Courtyard. The colours of the gate leading into the Courtyard of the Tabernacle were blue, purple, scarlet, and fine twisted linen (white). These colours appear in the same order in several places in the Tabernacle.</p>
<p>
The door to the Tabernacle building in the Courtyard also was of blue, purple, scarlet and fine twisted linen. This hanging of material was upheld by five posts of acacia wood overlaid with gold and topped with gold capitals.</p>
<p>
The beautiful gate to the Courtyard and the higher door to the Tabernacle building gave the Israelite who came with his offering some idea of the magnificence of the gold-covered interior of the wooden Tabernacle building—the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place.</p>
<p>
From the outside only two of the seven pieces of furniture could be seen. These were the great bronze Altar of Burnt Offering on which the lambs, goats, bullocks, rams and birds were sacrificed; and the Laver, which stood between the Altar of Burnt Offering and the door of the Tabernacle building.</p>
<p>
The long sides of the Tabernacle building and of the linen fence ran west to east, with the entrances (door and gate) on the eastern end when the Ark of the Covenant was facing east.</p>
<p>
There were five pieces of furniture in the Tabernacle building. When the priest stepped inside the door of the Tabernacle, on his right, that is, on the north side (when the Ark was facing east), was the Table of Show bread. <br>It was constructed of wood and overlaid with gold. On his left, the south side, was the solid-gold Lamp stand.</p>
<p>
Straight in front of the priest, just this side of the Veil that partitioned off the Most Holy Place on the western end of the building, was the gold-covered Altar of Incense.</p>
<p>
On the annual Day of Atonement, when the high priest was allowed to go past the Veil, he carried a censer, an incense burner, into the Most Holy Place (some scholars differ on the exact procedure here). Straight before him in the centre of the Most Holy Place, a cubical room about 4.5m on a side, was the gold-covered Ark of the Covenant.</p>
<p>
Serving as a lid on the top of the Ark of the Covenant was the solid-gold Mercy Seat (literally, Atonement Cover) with the two covering cherubim hammered into shape from the same solid piece of gold from which the Mercy Seat itself was beaten into shape by Bezaleel (Ex 37:6-9).</p>
<p>
The Israelites pitched their tents outside the linen fence.

When Israel set forward on the march these tribes moved out in a specific order, completely protecting the Levites who were carrying the Tabernacle. <br>The entire arrangement shows us plainly that God intended for the Tabernacle, His dwelling place among mankind, to be central in the life and culture of Israel.</p>
<p>
The Ark of the Covenant was carried in the centre of the line of march. <br>The Ark was of special importance because in the Ark were the two tablets of stone, the Testimony, the Ten Commandments. <br>The Ten Commandments were the covenant of God with Israel; therefore the Ark was termed the Ark of the Covenant.</p>
<p>
The Ten Commandments were the testimony that God gave concerning His requirements for the conduct of the people of Israel and, in fact, for the conduct of all mankind. Those requirements were in the form of judgements against sin.</p>
<p>
We have seen then that the Tabernacle was a rather large structure consisting of a gold-covered wooden building in a fenced-in area, set up by the Hebrews in the Sinai wilderness during their journey from Egypt to the land of promise. The pattern of the Tabernacle was shown to Moses by the Lord (Heb 8:5).<br>It was the dwelling place of God in a human neighbourhood (Ex 25:8; 29:45).</p>
<p>
The Tabernacle was an earthly figure of the Temple of God in Heaven <br>(Heb 9:23,24).</p>
<p>
The Tabernacle was divided into three main parts. The outer area, the Courtyard, was surrounded by the linen fence (Ex 27:9).<br>The courtyard was not covered over. It was an outside area lighted by the sun.</p>
<p>
The second and third areas were inside the wooden structure, which was covered by the linen curtain, the goats’ hair curtain, the rams’ skins dyed red, and the badgers’ skins—four layers of material. The interior of the wooden structure was never seen by the Israelites except those persons set apart for the priestly work associated with the Tabernacle.</p>
<p>
The wooden building was divided into the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies (Most Holy Place). The separating partition was the ornate Veil.<br> The Veil was ripped open from top to bottom by unseen hands when the Lord Jesus died on the cross, signifying that Christians, through the atoning blood of Jesus, now have access to the very Presence of the Father in Heaven <br>(Heb 6:7-12; 10:19,20).</p>
<p>
In the Holy Place, the larger room of the wooden building (about 4.5m wide, 4.5m high, and 9m long), were placed the table that held the consecrated loaves of Show bread; the golden Lamp stand, which is an important symbol of Judaism to this day; and the Altar of Incense. <br>The Holy Place was lighted at night by the Lamp stand.</p>
<p>
The Holy of Holies, the western end of the wooden building, was cubical in proportion—about 4.5m by 4.5m. Inside the Holy of Holies was the gold-covered wooden chest, the Ark of the Covenant, in which were placed the Ten Commandments, the memorial jar of manna, and Aaron’s rod that budded.</p>
<p>
The lid of the Ark of the Covenant was the solid gold Mercy Seat, with a cherub on each end overshadowing the Mercy Seat with its wings. The Holy of Holies was lighted by the Glory of God Himself.</p>
<p>
Out in the Courtyard, directly in line with and just before the door of the Tabernacle building, were placed the Altar of Burnt Offering and the bronze Laver.</p>
<p>
Hopefully this brief overview of the Tabernacle will give you a clearer picture of what we are talking about as we go into the application of this major biblical type to the redemption of the believer.
<h3>
 The Seven Holy Furnishings
</h3>
<p>
This is a brief summary the interpretation of each of the seven furnishings of the Tabernacle in terms of the redemption of the believer.<br> The seven main furnishings portray the development of the Christian from the time he approaches Christ initially until he arrives at the full salvation of God.
<p>
Altar of Burnt Offering (Ex 27:1)</p>
<p>
Laver (Ex 30:18)</p>
<p>
Table of Show bread (Ex 25:23)</p>
<p>
Lamp stand (Ex 25:31)</p>
<p>
Altar of Incense (Ex 30:1)</p>
<p>
Ark of the Covenant (Ex 25:10)</p>
<p>
Mercy Seat (Ex 25:17)</p>

 <p><font size="+1">
Altar of Burnt Offering</font></p>
<p>
All offerings made by fire took place at this bronze altar.</p>
<p>
The Altar of Burnt offering portrays the crucifixion of our Lord Jesus Christ on Calvary, brought to our minds continually in the sacrament of Communion; the atonement that Christ has made for our sins; our Passover Lamb.<br>
 God meets man only at the cross</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Laver</font></p> 
<p>
The Laver, also of bronze, was a wash basin placed out in the Courtyard of the Tabernacle between the Altar of Burnt Offering and the door of the Tabernacle.</p>
<p>
The Laver signifies our separation from sin and the world by our crucifixion with Christ, established by water baptism; purification from the filth of the world as we keep ourselves holy by confession, repentance, resistance to sin, obedience to God’s will, the atoning blood of Christ, the power of the Holy Spirit, and the Word of God; the washing away of our sins that comes about by receiving and obeying the Word of God.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Table of Show bread </font></p> 
<p>
The Table was made from acacia wood covered with gold.</p>
<p>
The Table of Show bread typifies the continual presentation of the living Word of God, Christ, the eating of whom builds up Christ in the believer; the receiving of the body and blood of the Lord in the Communion service;<br> Christ, the Bread from Heaven; the born-again experience.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
 Lamp stand</font></p> 
<p>
This furnishing had a central shaft and six side-branches. At the top of the central shaft and of each of the side-branches was a golden lamp that burned olive oil. The Lamp stand and its accessories were beaten out of one mass of pure gold.</p>
<p>
The golden Lamp stand represents the baptism with the Holy Spirit into the Body of Christ; the various ministries and gifts of the Holy Spirit; anointing for Christian ministry and service; the law of the Spirit of Life; Pentecost; the Head and Body of Christ, who is the Anointed Deliverer, the Servant of the Lord.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
 Altar of Incense</font></p> 
<p>
The Altar of Incense stood in the Holy Place before the Veil, in direct line with the Ark of the Covenant. <br>The Altar of Incense was constructed from acacia wood covered with gold.</p>
<p>
The Altar of Incense speaks to us of the Life and Person of the Lord Jesus worked into the life and person of the believer by the Holy Spirit, so that the believer’s prayers and worship bring the fragrance of His beloved Son before the face of the Father in Heaven; death to self-love and self-will.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
 Ark of the Covenant</font></p> 
<p>
The Ark was made from acacia wood covered with gold. Acacia wood and gold were two of the most important building materials of the Tabernacle of the Congregation.</p>
<p>
The Ark of the Covenant typifies the Lord Jesus Christ, and therefore the saint of God in whom Christ is being formed, who is overcoming sin in his daily walk, and who is learning perfect obedience to the Father. <br>In his heart are the following three graces:</p>
<p>
1. The Ten Commandments—the Law of God wrought in his character.</p>
<p>
2. The memorial jar of manna—daily strength from Christ; the body and blood of Christ, our daily Bread from Heaven; the trait of depending continually on Christ each moment of the day for all matters great and small.</p>
<p>
3. Aaron’s rod that budded—the power of eternal resurrection life that operates in the priesthood God has chosen.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
 Mercy Seat</font></p> 
<p>
The Mercy Seat (Lid of Reconciliation) was beaten out of pure gold and served as a covering lid for the Ark of the Covenant.</p>
<p>
The solid-gold Mercy Seat portrays the fullness of the Glory of God in Christ through the Holy Spirit; the image of Christ formed in spirit, soul and body; authority and power through Christ over all things; the abiding of the Persons of the Godhead in the Christian.</p>
