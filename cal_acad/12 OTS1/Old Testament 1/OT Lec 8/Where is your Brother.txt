Where is your Brother

<h3>
The worship of the two brothers 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.” (Gen 4:2)</font> <br>Abel was a shepherd and Cain was a farmer. Both of these vocations are noble; one is not better than the other. This leads into an exercise in worship.<br><font color= "blue">
“And in the process of time it came to pass that Cain brought an offering of the fruit of the ground to the Lord. Abel also brought of the first born of his flock and of their fat. And the Lord respected Abel and his offering, but He did not respect Cain and his offering.” (Gen 4:3-5)</font></p>
<p>
Both brothers brought offerings to the Lord suitable to their vocations (Gen 4:3). Yet, God regarded Abel and his offering and not Cain and his offering <br>(Gen 4:4). Some insist that the reason for this is Abel offered a blood sacrifice while Cain did not. However, there does not appear to be anything wrong with Cain offering fruit as opposed to animal sacrifice.</p>
<p>
Later in Israel’s history, grain offerings and harvest offerings are legitimate expressions of worship that God accepts and even commands. So if it is not a failure to bring a blood sacrifice, why does God reject Cain and his offering?</p>
<p>
The New Testament authors inform us that God regarded Abel because he had faith (Heb 11:4) while Cain did not (Jude 11-13 and 1 John 3:11-12). <br>Therefore, it seems clear that Abel was in relationship with God and Cain was separated from God. A very important principle is this: “God always inspects the giver and the worshipper before He inspects the gift, service, or worship.” This means it is critical that you are in relationship with God before you seek to worship or serve Him. Otherwise, your worship is unacceptable.</p>
<p>
There is also an interesting clue in the Genesis account that tells us about Cain and Abel and their offerings. In Gen 4:4, Moses records that Abel offers “the first born of his flock” (cf. Ex 34:19; Deut 12:6; 14:23) and “their fat”<br> (cf. Num 18:17) for his offering. The word that is translated “fat” means “choicest, best part, or abundance.” Abel gave what cost him most—the first born! On the other hand, Cain merely offers “the fruit,” not the first fruit, of the ground (Gen 4:3). Abel brought the best parts of his flocks and Cain was not so particular. Abel went out of his way to worship God by giving his best. <br>Cain merely discharged a duty. <br>One of the key themes throughout Scripture is God seeks worship that is perfect and costly (Lev 22:20-22; 2 Sam 24:24). He will not be satisfied with second best (Mal 1:6-14; Rom 12:1).</p>
<h3>
Motives matter to God. 
</h3>
<p>
God is not impressed with those who do the right thing for the wrong reason. This truth is taught throughout the Bible. Jesus looks at the Pharisees and quotes Isaiah,<br> <font color= "blue">
“These people draw near to Me with their mouth, and honour Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me” (Matt 15:8)</font>
(see also Micah 6:7-8).<br> 
Sometimes people can have very bad motives for doing good things.<br> 
What are our motives for serving the Lord? Every so often we need to do a motive check up and ask ourselves:<br> Why am I nice to other people?<br> Why do I put money in the offering plate? <br>

[Whatever the cause of God’s rejection of Cain’s offering; the narrative itself focuses our attention on Cain’s response. It is there that the narrative seeks to make its point.]</p>
<p>
The response of the oldest brother:<br>
When Cain learned that <font color= "blue">
He did not respect Cain and his offering. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell” (Gen 4:5)</font>
Cain became angry with God! Rather than being concerned about remedying the situation and pleasing God, he became very angry. We must stop here and ask these questions of ourselves: How do we respond when God says no?(Gen 4:6-8)</p>
<p>
When God convicts us and deals with the sin in our lives, how do we respond? Do we seek to make things right? Do we come before the Lord in worship and confession with a humble and contrite heart?

Or do we pout and get ticked off? The Old Testament prophet, Isaiah, said it best,<br> <font color= "blue">
“But to this one I will look, to him who is poor and of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at My word” (Isa 66:2)</font></p>
<p>
In customary fashion, the Lord pursues Cain with three consecutive questions: <font color= "blue">“Why are you angry? And why has your countenance fallen? If you do well, will not your countenance be lifted up?” (Gen 4:6-7)</font> <br>God was not pleased with Cain or his offering. These first two questions demonstrate that He was even more displeased by Cain’s response. <br>Yet, many of us have been told by other well-meaning Christians that it is perfectly acceptable to get mad at God. We like to justify our anger by saying, “He’s a big God. He has broad shoulders. He can handle my cussing and complaining.” Well, sure He can, but is this the appropriate response to the almighty Creator of heaven and earth? I don’t think so. He is a sovereign God that is to be feared. He wants us to trust Him, even when things don’t make sense. Unfortunately, many Christians have a small view of God that allows them to have temper tantrums with Him.</p>
<p>
The Lord said to Cain, <font color= "blue">“And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door; and its desire is for you, but you should rule over it.” (Gen 4:7)</font> <br>This clearly implies that Cain knew what was right. He knew the quality of offering to bring and chose not to bring it. He knew his heart was not right, but he chose not to address it. Yet, this verse also shows God’s grace, for Cain was still invited to bring the correct offering. God warned Cain and He wanted Cain to “do well,” but Cain hardened his heart. Sin is like a wild animal ready to pounce and devour its victim. What a graphic picture the Lord paints!<br> What a reminder that we do indeed have a choice whether or not to sin.</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, instead of heeding God’s warning, Cain ignored God’s words and allowed himself to be mastered by sin. This resulted in the very first murder. Moses writes of the tragic event:<br><font color= "blue"> “Now Cain talked with Abel his brother; and it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.” (Gen 4:8)</font> <br>In his anger, Cain took the life of another human being ... and his victim was his very own brother. The use of “rise up” is most appropriate, since the “rising up” of Cain to kill his brother is a direct consequence of the “falling” of his countenance, when Abel’s offering was accepted but his was not.<br> Under the Mosaic Law, the fact that a killing took place in a field, out of the range of help, was proof of premeditation (cf. Deut 22:25-27).<br>We cringe at such a horrible act and think, “I could never do something like that.” But if we were honest, many of us would have to confess our own lists of people we’ve assassinated with our words or attitudes.<br>

A lesson we learn from the murder of Abel is that anger and jealousy can be very destructive. It is certainly not Abel’s fault that Cain’s sacrifice is not pleasing to God. But when God accepts Abel’s offering and rejects Cain’s, Cain directs his anger, jealousy, and hatred toward his brother. <br>The history of crime shows that when given the opportunity, hatred often leads to murder. That is what Jesus was pointing to in Matt 5:22 where He says hating your brother is really the same as murder.<br>

You may be angry today. It might have been something, which happened this morning. Maybe you are mad at your mom and dad because they won’t let you go to a friend’s house after church. Or maybe something happened years ago. Perhaps a neighbour or someone in the church cheated you out of some money or took advantage of you in some way, and you still have a bitter attitude. Whatever type the anger is, you need to get control of it and get rid of it. <br>Eph 4:27 says if you don’t control your anger, you give the Devil a foothold <br>(lit. “a place”) in your life. That is what Cain did. Uncontrolled anger and jealousy resulted in Abel’s death and destroyed Cain’s life too.<br> Don’t let it happen in your life. Acknowledge that the attitude is wrong, confess it to the Lord, and ask His help in overcoming this destructive attitude.</p>
<p>
The pursuit of a gracious God (Gen 4:9-16). In Gen 4:9, Cain foolishly thought he could hide his sin from God. He followed in his father’s footsteps (Gen 3:8). Yet, God sought Cain just like He sought Adam and Eve. God is a seeker.<br> After Cain’s treacherous sin, the Lord did the unthinkable—he dialogued with Cain. <br>He spoke with grace, not wrath. <font color= "blue"> Then the Lord said to Cain, “Where is Abel your brother?”</font> Cain responded by saying, <font color= "blue">“I do not know.”</font> <br>Cain began on a sinful note by lying to God. Puny old Cain told an omniscient God that he didn’t know where his brother Abel was. Come on! <br>The fact that Cain dispassionately denied what he had done and showed a total lack of care and concern for his brother closely parallels man’s total lack of regard for woman in Gen 3:12, where man icily referred to his companion as “the woman” and placed all the blame on her, thereby revealing a complete absence of the intimacy and companionship that earlier had characterised their relationship.<br>

To make matters worse, Cain went on to utter the infamous old adage,<br> <font color= "blue">“Am I my brother’s keeper?”</font> This was a tragic mistake on Cain’s part. <br>Now, if I was God, I would have smoked Cain right where he stood! But not the Lord!<br> Instead, He asked Cain a follow-up question that is the same question He asked Eve (Gen 3:13): <font color= "blue">“What have you done?”</font> Wouldn’t you just hate to have been Cain right then? <br>The Lord then stopped asking questions and said, <font color= "blue">“The voice of your brother’s blood cries out to Me from the ground” (Gen 4:10)</font>. This is a key sentence. <br>The words “to me” demonstrate how seriously God takes first-degree murder. When another person kills a baby, a child, or an adult made in the image of God (Gen 1:26; 9:6), the blood of the victim cries out to God! Sin cannot be covered up from God. It can be hidden from people, but not from God.<br> Secret sin on earth is open scandal in heaven!</p>
<p>
As a consequence of Cain’s act of deliberate sin, God cursed him, just like He cursed the serpent (Gen 3:14) and the ground (Gen 3:17-19).<br> Woe! Moses records these tragic words: <font color= "blue">“So now you are cursed from the earth, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield its strength to you. A fugitive and a vagabond you shall be on the earth.” (Gen 4:11-12)</font> <br>This is the first instance in Scripture where a human is “cursed.” <br>The ultimate penalty for a Hebrew is not death, but exile, a loss of roots.</p>
<p>
<font color= "blue">
“And Cain said to the Lord, “My punishment is greater than I can bear! Surely You have driven me out this day from the face of the ground; I shall be hidden from Your face; I shall be a fugitive and a vagabond on the earth, and it will happen that anyone who finds me will kill me.” (Gen 4:13-14)</font><br>
Cain’s complaint is peppered with the use of seven personal pronouns.<br>All Cain cared about was himself. There was no fear or reverence for God, no regret for the loss of innocent life, no sorrow for sin, and no thought for his parents who had lost one son tragically through murder and would be losing another through rebellion. There was only a preoccupation with himself.<br> The killer fears being killed. He who turned on one of his relatives now must watch out for any of his relatives.</p>
<p>
The Lord speaks again to Cain, <font color= "blue">
“Therefore whoever kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold." And the Lord set a mark on Cain, lest anyone finding him should kill him. (Gen 4:15) </font>
God continues to demonstrate His grace and compassion—even to Cain! The Lord gave Cain a sign before judgement was carried out. Isn’t this just like the Lord?</p>
<p>
The Lord’s program always seems to be mercy before judgement. <br>How fortunate we are that this is the case. If it weren’t, we would have been snuffed out a long time ago! No matter what you’ve done, God wants a relationship with you. There is no sin that you have ever committed that is too big for God. He will accept you if you accept His Son’s sacrifice for your sin.<br> We do not know what the “sign” was. Some have supposed it was a mark of some kind on Cain himself (e.g., a tattoo), others a special hairstyle. <br>One of the ancient rabbis argued that the sign was a dog that accompanied Cain on his wanderings. The dog assured Cain of God’s protection and frightened attackers. Others think it is some sign in the external world, such as an intensified fear of killing another human being. To that end, God places a mark on Cain before he expels him. This will protect Cain from recrimination.<br>Here again is mercy before judgement.</p>
<p>
We read these sad words: <font color= "blue">
“Then Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the land of Nod on the east of Eden.” (Gen 4:16)</font><br>
 One question that is asked is: Did Cain repent? Probably not.<br> The New Testament Scriptures uniformly speak of Cain in the negative with phrases like “the way of Cain” (Jude 1:11) and one “who was of the wicked one and slew his brother” (1 John 3:12). His life is contrasted with “righteous Abel” (Matt 23:35).<br> Nevertheless, we do not know what ultimately happened to him. He may have responded to God. Cain was not beyond God’s grace and neither are you.</p>
<p>
It is important to note that Adam’s sin (Gen 3:6-7) progresses to murder between brother and brother (Gen 4:1-16), and then to the decay of society (Gen 4:17-26).</p>
