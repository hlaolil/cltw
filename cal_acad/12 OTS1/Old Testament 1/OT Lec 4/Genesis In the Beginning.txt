Genesis <br>In the Beginning
</h1>
<p><font color= "blue">
“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth” (Gen 1:1)</font>.<br> These famous opening words of the Bible express the Hebrew and later the Christian belief about the foundation of the universe.<br> Does the universe have meaning? Genesis tells us that it does.<br> The universe was divinely conceived. Therefore, it can only be fully understood in light of a divine plan.<br>
Here are some of the main things we learn from the creation account:
<h3>
God is the Creator 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
Then God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good. <br>(Gen 1:31)</font>.<br>
The climax of God’s creation was the making of man and woman <br>(Gen 1: 26-27).<br>Human beings are different from other creatures in two essential ways.<br>First, we are made in God’s image.<br> Second, we have dominion over the rest of the physical creation.<br>
God’s six days of creative activity and the seventh day of rest set a pattern, which was later used for a weekly cycle of work and worship <br>(Gen 2:2-3; Ex 20:11).<br>
The poetic flow of the Hebrew language of Genesis is simple, yet profound. Creation is described as taking place in six days.</p> 
<p>
The purpose of the Genesis account is to establish God as Creator (Heb 1:10). It was never intended to be a scientific explanation of how He accomplished the creation. The Bible is not a science textbook. The scientist searches for the what and how of life’s questions, but the Bible addresses the who and why behind those questions.<br>

Before scientific knowledge proliferated during the last 200 years, most Christians believed that Gen 1 was a literal description of the beginning of the universe. Many Christians still do. <br>However, a considerable number of Bible scholars today, while believing in the inspiration and accuracy of the Genesis account, find the traditional, literal interpretation inconsistent with evidence from scientific research.</p>
<p>
These scholars have offered various explanations to account for these apparent inconsistencies. <br>Some, having noticed that “light and darkness” is the subject of both the first and fourth days of creation (Gen 1:3-5 and Gen 1:14-19), <br>“waters and sky” the second and fifth days (Gen 1:6-8 and Gen 1:20-23), and “land life”  the third and sixth days (Gen 1:9-13 and Gen 1:24-31), believe the account to be a poetic or schematic portrayal of creation.</p>
<h3>
The Creation Week
</h3>
<p>
Day 1: separation of light and darkness, day and night	</p>
<p>
Day 2: separation of water and sky, the expanse	</p>
<p>
Day 3: separation of land and water; creation of plants</p>
<p>
Day 4: creation of sun and moon to govern the day and night</p>
<p>
Day 5: creation of animals for the water and the sky</p>
<p>
Day 6: creation of animals for the land, and humans to govern all animals</p>
<p>
Day 7: creation completed; God rests</p>
<h3>
Garden of Eden
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"The Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there He put the man whom He had formed. (Gen 2:8).</font>
Other scholars consider Gen 1:2-31 as describing a re-creation. This view was popularised by C.I. Scofield in his reference Bible, published in the United States in 1909.<br> Scofield believed that Gen 1:1 describes an initial creation that took place in the dateless past,” while verses Gen 1:2-31 describe a re-creation of an earth being prepared for human life. 
<h3>
Eve
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall on Adam, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in its place. Then the rib which the Lord God had taken from man He made into a woman, and He brought her to the man ... And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed." (Gen 2:21-22, 25)</font><br>
This theory attempted to harmonise the Bible and geology. The intervening gap between the beginning (Gen 1:1) and the seven days of re-creation, Scofield reasoned, would be great enough to explain the fossils and rock strata found in the geological record. It would also explain the apparent contradiction between Isa 45:18, which says that God did not create the earth “in vain”, and Gen 1:2, which describes the earth as being “without form, and void”<br>

According to Scofield, the verb “was” should be translated “became.” Gen 1:2, in this view, reads, “And the earth became without form, and void.” <br>Although the Hebrew word allows for such a translation (it has the meaning of “became” in Gen 19:26, Deut 27:9 and 2 Sam 7:24). Hence, it could also be translated, “Now the earth was without form, and void”.</p>
<p>
While Bible scholars have proposed various interpretations of the creation account, Genesis does not explain the natural laws or the mechanism by which God created the universe. Genesis is not physics, astronomy or geology. <br>It is a story of faith, telling why we came to be and to whom we belong. <br>Its message is that <font color= "blue">“The earth is the Lord’s, and all its fullness, the world and those who dwell therein” (Psa 24:1)</font>. <br>It declares that in the beginning there was God, and that all things came to be as God called them forth.</p>
<p>
This does not mean, however, that a Christian should leave scientific knowledge at the church door. When properly interpreted, scientific evidence may help us understand certain details.<br> When scientific evidence seems to contradict biblical revelation, one or the other, or perhaps both, have been misunderstood. </p>
<h3>
“Image” and “likeness” 
</h3>
<p> 
The Bible makes an important distinction between humans and other living creatures. The animals were made <font color= "blue">according to its kind, (Gen 1:25)</font> <br>
<font color= "blue">
God created man in His own image; in the image of God He created him; male and female He created them. (Gen 1:26-27)</font> <br>This means that humans have a special relationship with God and can communicate with him.</p>
<p>
Knowing that we are made in God’s image provides a solid basis for self-worth. Human worth is not based on possessions, achievements, physical attractiveness, or public acclaim. <br>Instead it is based on being made in God’s image. [Furthermore,] God made both man and woman in His image. Neither man nor woman is made more in the image of God than the other.<br> 
Men and women have equal access to God and can equally experience a personal relationship with Him.
<h3>
Adam and Eve disobey God 
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
"And out of the ground the Lord God made every tree grow that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil." (Gen 2:9)</font>.</p>
<p>
This second account of creation is written from a different point of view: <br>It focuses on the first humans. It also uses a different name for God.<br> In the first account, God is referred to as Elohim which means “the mighty God the Creator, the Great One who inhabits eternity.” <br>Elohim is used in this important account to emphasise God’s sovereign power. <br>In the second account, the name used for God is Yahweh Elohim.<br> Yahweh is used when God emphasises the importance of His relationship with humanity.</p>
<p>
God planted a garden as a residence for the man, Adam. <br>But on his own, Adam was incomplete – as He soon recognised (Gen 2:20).<br> So God created woman, a separate but equal creation, sharing man’s essential and unique nature. This was not an afterthought, of course – the delay in creating the woman was intentional, to increase the man’s appreciation for her. Adam named the woman Eve (Gen 3:20).</p>
<p>
God thus established the institution of marriage as the union of one man and one woman for life. Because of this, marriage is to be held in honour.<br> Marriage was not a product of human culture. God designed it for the happiness of the human race, to enable love to be expressed within a family structure, and as a means of reproduction. Both husband and wife have important responsibilities in the marital relationship (Gen 2:24; Eph 5:21-33).</p>
<p>
God gave Adam and Eve permission to eat fruit from the many different trees in the garden, including the fruit of the “tree of life” (Gen 2:9, 16). <br>That tree symbolised constant access to God and eternal life (Rev 2:7; 22:14). Only one tree was off limits. God told Adam and Eve, <font color= "blue">“but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die.” (Gen 2:17)</font>. <br>Adam and Eve were faced with a test of obedience. Would they listen to their Creator’s instructions, or would they choose to disobey? </p>
<p>
The wily serpent, who symbolised Satan the devil (Rev 12:9), now entered the scene. He approached Eve, and, imputing an evil intention to God’s command, expressed his own doubts (Gen 3:1).<br> The serpent’s objective was to pose as a benefactor, to entice Adam and Eve to sin. <font color= "blue">Then the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die. For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil” (Gen 3:4-5)</font>.</p>
<p>
Eve was enticed by Satan’s words. <img

height="175" hspace="10" vspace="0" border="0" align="right"><br>She had to see for herself if she would truly receive this Godlike power.<br> Eventually, Eve <font color= "blue">“took of its fruit and ate. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate” (Gen 3:6)</font>.<br
> The first man and woman failed their basic test of faith.<br> Thousands of years later, the apostle Paul explained that both Adam and Eve were guilty of sin in this action (Rom 5:12-14; 2 Cor 11:3).</p>
<h3>
The results of Adam and Eve disobeying God 
</h3>
<p>
The serpent had cleverly undermined the relationship that should have existed between human beings and God. He tricked our first parents into defying the Creator’s command by suggesting that God was greedy and selfish and was trying to keep something good away from them. Through an attitude that was an affront to God Himself (Psa 51:4), Adam and Eve ruined their chances of living a God-centred life. The serpent had lured them into alienating themselves from their Creator.</p>
<p>
By disregarding God’s command, Adam and Eve had made a fateful choice. They had attempted to run their lives according to what seemed right to them and not according to the principles clearly enunciated by God.<br> They usurped God’s authority and set themselves up as lawgiver, judge and jury of the way things ought to be. The couple asserted their independence from God, and grasped at an imagined equality with him. They thought that the forbidden fruit would be the key to vital knowledge they needed – knowledge that God was withholding from them.</p>
<p>
Adam and Eve liked the idea of being “like God” in knowledge.<br> But their perception was terribly distorted. God’s intention was for them to grow in knowledge through seeking His divine will and unlimited wisdom. Through their disobedience, the first humans terminated their contact with the only sure source of truth.<br> In this sense, they barred themselves from the Garden of Eden and from the tree of life (Gen 3:24).</p>
<p>
Yet, even as Adam and Eve cut themselves off from God’s presence, He mercifully gave them a promise and a hope for the future salvation of the human race. <br>In what is often called the Bible’s first messianic prophecy, God told the serpent, <font color= "blue">“And I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her Seed; He shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise His heel.” (Gen 3:15)</font>.</p>
<h3>
God's plan to save humanity
</h3>
<p>
To reverse the consequences of human sin, God would send His Son, Jesus Christ, to die for us. Satan would strike the heel of the Saviour, Jesus Christ, through the crucifixion. However, Jesus would triumph over evil and death through His resurrection from the dead. Thus, He was prophesied from the beginning to “crush” Satan’s head by destroying the power of sin and the serpent’s sin-filled system.</p>
<p>
The disobedience of our parents, Adam and Eve, plunged the human race into sin (Rom 5:12). Yet, when we uncover the complete biblical picture, we see that, in spite of our flawed past and uncertain present, we humans can look forward to a positive future.<br>

God has a plan to save humanity, and the Bible tells us about that plan. <br>It is, above all, a story of hope! <br>As we explore the Word of God, we will discover that we are destined to inherit eternal life in the kingdom of God. <br>To experience this magnificent purpose, however, we must first be reconciled to God through the sacrifice of His Son, Jesus Christ (Rom 5:9-21).</p>
