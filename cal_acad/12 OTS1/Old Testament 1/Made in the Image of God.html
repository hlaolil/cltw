   <h1>
Made in the Image of God
</h1>
<p>
The Palmist asks, <font color= "blue">What is man that You are 

mindful of him, and the son of man that You visit him? (Psa 

8:4)</font>. <br>Today's culture does not take a high view of man, and 

answers to the question "What is man?" would vary, depending on whom 

you ask. <br>But the biblical answer to this question is that men and 

women are created in the image of God (Gen 1:26-27). Thus, to truly 

comprehend what it means to be human, we must understand the image of 

God in man.</p>
<h3>
Understanding the image of God in man
</h3>
<p>
The study of the doctrine of the image of God in man must address 

four questions.<br> 
First, what does it mean that man and woman have been created in the 

image of God?<br> 
Second, how was the image of God in man marred or affected by the 

Fall? <br>
Third, how is the image of God in man restored in salvation? <br>
Fourth, how is this truth significant to us today? <br>
This article will focus on the first three questions by looking at 

the theological aspects of the image of God. Then it will take up the 

fourth question by exploring the practical applications of the image 

of God in man.</p>
<h3>
Theological Aspects of the Image of God
</h3>
<p>
That we are created in the image of God says something awesome about 

God in His creative purposes. It also says something wonderful about 

the uniqueness of humans in God's grand design.<br> But what does it 

mean? The theological challenge in the image of God in man is the 

fact that the Bible does not define explicitly what it means that 

humanity is made in the image of God.</p>
<p>
Three authors provide helpful theological direction for us.<br> Wayne 

Grudem pointed out that the words used in Gen 1:26-27, "image" and 

"likeness" in the Hebrew "refer to something that is similar but not 

identical to the thing that it represents or is the 'image' of." 

Therefore, Gen 1:26, "would have meant to the original readers, "Let 

us make man to be like us and to represent us." <br>Bruce Ware noted that 

"the image of God in man involves God's creation of divine 

representations (images of God) who, in relationship with God and 

each other, function to represent God (imaging God) in carrying out 

God's designated responsibilities."<br> Anthony Hoekema wrote that the 

image of God "describes not just something that man has, but 

something man is." Building on these observations, a theological 

construct for the image of God in man begins to crystallise.</p>
<h3>
The Meaning of the Image of God
</h3>
<p>
Several characteristics in the uniqueness of humanity help us 

understand the meaning of the image of God in man. While this is not 

an exhaustive list, the following seven characteristics reflect the 

image of God in man.</p>
<p>
1. We are spiritual beings. We are created to represent and worship 

our God who is Spirit. Human beings are not merely material beings.<br> 

When God created the first man, He breathed into his nostrils the 

breath of life (Gen 2:7), making man a living soul and giving to him 

spiritual life.<br> Only humans are able to relate to God in worship and 

communication.<br> A vital component of this spiritual nature is 

immortality — human beings that will never cease to exist but will 

live forever.</p>
<p>
2. We are personal beings. We are created by a personal God, and our 

person hood reflects that aspect of God. He created humans with 

personality, as unique individuals with self-consciousness and 

purpose.<br> While every man and woman share common characteristics, no 

two people are alike. <br>Since each individual is stamped with the image 

of God, each human life has significance before God.</p>
<p>
3. We are moral beings. God is holy. He created humanity with a moral 

compass, a conscience that gives each of us an inner sense of the 

difference between right and wrong. The conscience may be deadened or 

seared by sin, but it remains hard wired in man. The hardest question 

for both atheists and evolutionists is how to explain the moral 

nature in the human race, in every culture, in every people group, 

and even in every religion.<br> Moreover, man's moral capacity makes him 

accountable to God for his actions.</p>
<p>
4. We are relational beings. God reveals the relational nature of the 

Trinity in this phrase: <font color= "blue">Let Us make man in Our image, according to 

Our likeness <br>(Gen 1:26)</font>. <br>God created us with the capacity to relate 

both to God and to others. <br>Humans were not made to live in isolated 

individualism. Thus, the image of God is involved in how we relate in 

marriage and in the fellowship of the church, and how we relate to 

others in the Great Commandment and the Great Commission (see Gen 

2:18-25; Matt 19: 1-12; Gal 3:26-29).</p>
<p>
5. We are rational beings. God is a God of knowledge. While our 

knowledge is limited, God created us with the capacity to think, to 

know, and to learn. Christianity is not a mindless faith. Just the 

opposite. The intellectual aspect of the image of God in man means 

that our minds are a vital part of how we are to love God (Matt 

22:37), that we are to cultivate our minds (Eph 4:23), and that we 

are to renew our minds for transformation (Rom 12:2).</p>
<p>
6. We are emotional beings. We are made in the likeness of God who 

Himself is love. It is the emotive facet of our make up that allows 

us to experience intimacy with those close to us, to feel compassion 

for others, and to know the deep awe of God that causes us to delight 

and find soul satisfaction in Him.</p>
<p>
7. We are creative beings. God is the Creator. His glory is displayed 

in His creation. We have an insatiable desire to create, whether 

producing a piece of art, starting a business, writing a book, or 

landscaping the yard. <br>While our creativity is different from God's, 

who made everything from nothing, the linkage of the image of God in 

man in creation to the cultural mandate in Gen 1:26-27 speaks to our 

creative responsibility.</p>
<p>
Nancy Pearcey observes that the first phrase, be fruitful and 

multiply, may mean: "to develop the social world: build families, 

churches, schools, cities, government, laws." She suggests the second 

phrase, subdue the earth, means: "to harness the natural world: plant 

crops, build bridges, design computers, compose music. This passage

tells us that our original purpose was to create culture and build 

civilisations — nothing less."</p>
<h3>
The Image of God and the Fall
</h3>
<p>
The characteristics listed above are how we have historically 

understood the image of God in original creation. The question now is 

how did the Fall affect the image of God in men and women since? <br>The 

first response is that the entrance of sin did not eradicate or 

destroy the image of God. The clearest demonstrations of this are 

God's communication with Noah after the flood establishing the death 

penalty for murder because <font color= "blue">"in the image of God 

He made man." (Gen 9:6)(James 3:9)</font> which indicates we have 

retained the likeness of God.</p>
<p>
However, the image of God in humans was deeply marred or distorted by 

the Fall. Men and women died spiritually. Humanity's relationship 

with God was ruptured, as well as interpersonal relationships.</p> <p>Moral 

purity was lost, replaced by a sinful nature.</p>
<p> Personality was 

corrupted, producing an array of psychological problems.</p>
<p> Knowledge 

was degraded by false philosophies and vain imaginations.</p>
<p> Emotions 

were turned to selfish desires. </p>
<p>Creativity was despoiled by evil 

purposes and pursuits <br>(Rom 1:18-32; Eph 2:1-3; 4:24-32).</p>
<p> The 

uncorrupted image of God was replaced by the fallen image of the 

fallen Adam (Gen 5:1-3).</p>
<h3>
The Image of God and Salvation
</h3>
<p>
However, the Good News of Scripture — the central message of God's 

revelation — is that in redemption we are made a new creation and the 

first fruits of the new creation (Col 3:12). <br>Through sanctification, 

the believer in Jesus Christ progressively grows in godliness, 

conforming more and more to the likeness of God (2 Cor 3:18). <br>This 

on-going process of spiritual growth involves both a response on our 

part to God's purpose in our salvation and the deep work of God in 

our lives.<br> Our response is seen in such passages as (Col 3:10) 

where we are exhorted to put on (an act of conscious commitment) the 

new man, who is being renewed in knowledge according to the image of 

his Creator. <br>The work of God is His providence operating in all our 

life situations to conform us to the image of His Son (Rom 8:28-

29).</p>
<p>
That which started at salvation will be completed when Christ 

returns. <br>The image of God in man will be restored because, when He 

appears we will be like Him (1 John 3:2).</p>
<h3>
The Practical Applications of the Image of God
</h3>
<p>
There are profound implications and applications of the image of God 

in man for the Christian and the church. <br>John Piper highlights the 

significance it gives to us as human beings offering this definition: 

"The image of God in man is that in man which constitutes him as he-

whom-God-loves." <br>Regardless of how the image of God may be distorted 

by sin, the fact that men and women are still bearers of the image of 

God shapes our view and action toward others. Six critical areas of 

application stand out.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Evangelism and Missions.</font><br> The image of God in every man and woman 

everywhere gives emphasis to the priority of evangelism and missions. 

Since humans were created in the image of God and yet are fallen 

sinners, they miss out on their ultimate purpose in life — to glorify 

God by reflecting Him, loving Him, and worshipping Him. Evangelism 

and missions is God's appointed means to restore us to our original 

purpose. Moreover, the immortal aspect of the image of God in man 

underscores the urgency of reaching out to those who do not know the 

Lord Jesus. Their eternal destiny is at stake.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1"> Sanctity of life</font><br> No issue since slavery has so divided our nation 

as abortion. The reasoned voices for life must be heard. Nothing 

emphasises and promotes the sacredness and preciousness of life more 

than the image of God in man. <br>It goes to the core of the meaning of 

life. It means that human life is to be reverenced and respected. <br>Our 

stand against abortion is grounded in the fact that abortion is a sin 

against God as the creator of life and against the human life of the 

unborn (whether embryonic, fetal, or viable) as those who bear His 

image.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1"> Dignity</font><br> Inherent in the image of God in man is the dignity or 

worth of each individual. This has a profound impact on how we see, 

relate to and treat others.<br> C. S. Lewis stated it well, "There are no 

ordinary people. You have never talked to a mere mortal." <br>Clearly, 

the image of God in man condemns any type of bias toward, 

discrimination against, or exploitation of anyone on the basis of 

skin colour (racism), gender (sexism), economic status (classism), 

ethnic origin (ethnocentrism), or age (ageism) as sin.<br> James 3:9 

highlights the dignity accorded to man by pointing out the 

contradiction of using our mouths to bless God on one hand and on the 

other to curse people who are made in God's likeness.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1"> Sexuality</font><br> The high Christian view of sex is based on the fact 

that God created man and woman in His image as sexual beings with a 

commitment to marriage <br>(Gen 1:26-28; 2:21-25). <br>The sexual union of a 

man and wife is created for intimacy, fidelity, and faith. The 

intimacy of marriage also represents the Trinitarian relationship of 

God and man's intimacy with God.<br> Marital fidelity, one man and one 

woman as one flesh for one lifetime, is used throughout the 

Scripture to represent the people of God and their fidelity to Him.<br> 

By faith, we trust that God's provision for our well being restricts sexual intimacy to the bonds of marriage. The 

implications go to the heart of biblical sexual morality in a world 

plagued by pornography, premarital sex, extramarital sex, and 

homosexuality. </p><p>One, it distinguishes man from the animal kingdom, for 

whom sex is merely a biological function devoid of any spiritual 

meaning, committed attachment, or moral parameters.</p><p> Two, it warns us 

of how we dishonour God when we fail to reflect His image by taking 

sex outside the wonderful and ennobling relationship of marriage. </p>
<p>
Three, it is a positive guide to flourishing in marriage to the glory 

of God.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1"> Compassion toward others in need</font><br> When we look at other people 

through the lens of being bearers of the image of God, it is 

impossible to close our hearts to those who are suffering, poor, or 

marginalised. In His earthly ministry, Jesus healed the sick, fed the 

hungry, and delivered those held captive by the demonic. While He was 

moved with compassion by the temporal needs, He saw that meeting 

those needs was a bridge to meet the greater need and bring people to 

salvation.<br> And so it is for us, Gospel-driven ministries of mercy 

are viable visual representations of the mercy of God and grace of 

the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1"> The Church</font><br> Jesus Christ is the image of God (Col 1:15); 

there is a sense in which the church, as the Bride of Christ, is the 

image of God in Christ (Eph 1:22-23).<br> The church, as God's new 

humanity, represents the image of God by living with one another in 

shalom (peace), by loving our neighbours as ourselves, and by 

passionately sharing the Gospel with a lost world.</p>
<h3>
Conclusion
</h3>
<p>
A robust view of the image of God in man is an essential component of 

a biblical world view. It informs our understanding of both the 

purposes of God for us and what it truly means to be human. In a 

culture that increasingly diminishes the value of man, concluding 

that the human is merely one more animal produced in a random 

evolutionary process, it is critical that Christians embrace the 

biblical account and treat others accordingly, both inside and 

outside the community of faith.</p>
