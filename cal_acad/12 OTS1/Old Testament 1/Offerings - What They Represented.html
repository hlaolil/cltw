Offerings - What They Represented
</h1>
<p>
Because the offerings in Leviticus had their ultimate fulfilment in Jesus Christ, there is no need for them today (Heb 10:1-18). In fact, after Jesus sacrificed His life on the cross and rose again, the temple was destroyed in AD 70. <br>No sacrifices have been made there since. <br>
God gave the Book of Leviticus to a people already redeemed. <br>The offerings in Leviticus served as God’s gracious provision for how one could regain and sustain fellowship with God.</p>
<h3>
1. Burnt Offering
</h3>
<p>
The burnt offering teaches that God is pleased to accept anyone who comes to Him through His prescribed sacrifice (Lev 1:3). The whole animal was consumed on the altar, and it atoned for the worshipper’s sin.<br> It satisfied God’s wrath against sin and made fellowship possible between a holy God and a sinful person.</p>
<h3>
2. Grain Offering
</h3>
<p>
Someone accepted by God by His grace—through the burnt offering—could respond in 
gratitude through a grain (or cereal) offering (Lev 2:2). <br>It usually was an offering of flour and oil in which a handful was burned and the priests ate the rest. It was a gift to God from the best of the worshipper’s agricultural produce in an act of thanksgiving for sins forgiven.<br> 
An additional offering, the drink offering (or “libation”), was poured on top of the grain offering as a symbol of joy (Lev 23:13; cf. Ex 29:40-41).</p>
<h3> 
3. Peace Offering
</h3>
<p>
Unlike the other offerings, the peace offering was optional, given in addition to the burnt offering. The peace offering closed with a meal, in which the priests (representing God) the worshipper, and his or her friends ate together. The sacrifices had to be eaten in one or two days.<br>
There were three primary peace offerings:</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Thanksgiving Offering</font></p>
<p>
A freewill offering given as an act of thanksgiving to God when He blessed someone without their asking for it.<br> Only in this instance could an imperfect animal be offered (Lev 7:12-15).</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Wave offering</font></p>
<p> 
The priest’s portion of the peace offering was waved before the Lord as a special act signifying that it was His (Lev 7:30-31).</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Votive Offering</font></p> 
<p>
A freewill offering given because of a vow taken, or in relation to a favour, or a simple voluntary act of worship (Lev 7:16-17).</p>
<h3> 
4. Purification (Sin) Offering
</h3>
<p>
Though often called the “sin offering,” a better translation is “purification offering.” It dealt with two issues: the necessity of forgiveness from unintentional sins and of cleansing from ceremonial uncleanness (Lev 4:2-3). The purpose of the sin offering was to cleanse the tabernacle from human defilement, thus making possible the continuing fellowship and presence of God among His people.</p>
<h3>
5. Guilt (Reparation) Offering
</h3>
<p>
The guilt offering caused the individual to look beyond the sin to the damage it caused (Lev 5:16). The guilt offering is also called “reparation” because the person not only sought forgiveness, but first he or she also paid full restitution, adding to the price an additional percentage.</p>
