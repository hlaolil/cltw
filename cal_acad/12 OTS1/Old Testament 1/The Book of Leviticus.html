   <h1>
The Book of Leviticus
</h1>
<h2>
Exploring Leviticus
</h2>
<p>
The Jews called it:<br> “The law of the priests,”<br> “The book of the priests” and <br>

“The law of the offerings.”<br> These designations summarised the general content 

of the book, recognising it as a work intended primarily for the 

priesthood.<br>
The Septuagint calls the book Leuitikon or Leueitikon, “pertaining to the 

Levites.” The Latin Vulgate translated the Septuagint title as Liber 

Leviticus, “the book of Leviticus,” which then became the title in the English 

Bible.</p>
<h3>
Outline
</h3>
<p>
Leviticus begins where Exodus ends – at the foot of Mt. Sinai. <br>The tabernacle 

has just been completed, and God now begins to teach the Israelites how to 

worship Him. <br>Through the book of Leviticus, God shows Israel how to live as a 

holy nation.</p>
<p>
The book can be divided into six sections:</p>
<p> 
Sacrifices and Offerings (Lev 1:1­–7:38)</p>
<p> 
The Priesthood and the Tabernacle (Lev 8:1–10:20)</p>
<p> 
Regulations about life (Lev 11:1–15:33)</p>
<p>
The Day of Atonement (Lev 16:1-34)</p>
<p>
Living holy lives (Lev 17:1–22:33)</p>
<p>
Festivals and various regulations (Lev 23:1–27:34).</p>
<h3>
How to read this book
</h3>
<p>
To us, living in a modern society, the rituals and sacrifices explained in 

Leviticus may seem strange. Yet portions of the New Testament can be 

understood only by reference to Leviticus.</p>
<p>
For example, what does it mean for Christians to be a royal priesthood?<br> A holy 

nation? For Christ to be our great High Priest? Our Passover Lamb? Much of the 

original context of these New Testament concepts is found in Leviticus. 

Furthermore, some regulations in Leviticus go beyond the religious 

institutions and that deal with the events of life. The implication of those 

regulations is that all of life is, in fact, religious. All that we do, 

whether in direct worship or not, is part of our relationship to God .... God 

sees us as totalities, and all of our life – work, worship, relationships, 

creativity, family – is important to him.</p> 
<p>
The book of Leviticus leads us to an understanding of the ultimate sacrifice 

of Jesus the Messiah, but we must not overlook other important elements it 

contains. The book is not only a record of laws and traditions that were 

superseded by the ministry of Jesus Christ. There are many laws, customs, 

traditions and principles that address such subjects as hygiene, managing the 

environment and moral conduct. These are sound guidelines for all people and 

all times.</p>
<p>
For example, the rules about sexual purity (Lev 15:1-33) may be seen as 

emphasising the sanctity of sex and warning against its casual treatment. <br>The 

need for such advice today is obvious.<br> As the Evangelical Commentary on the 

Bible explains:</p>
<p>
Many Christians tend to ignore what the text meant to individual Israelites or 

to the community of Israel in Old Testament times and go immediately to a type 

study of Jesus and how He fulfilled many parts of Leviticus in the New 

Testament. We must first examine the text to see what it meant for Old 

Testament Israel. Only then can we proceed to a study of Jesus.</p>
<h3>
Learning about God
</h3>
<p>
Above all else, Leviticus teaches us that God is holy. This provides the basis 

of all His laws (Lev 11:44-45; 19:2-4; 20:7-8, 24-26).<br> Jewish sages 

considered this to be of primary importance. They felt that before 

proceeding to other biblical texts, children should first be educated 

concerning the sanctity of God and the responsibility of each individual to 

live a holy life</p> 
<p>
In Leviticus, God is present with His people. In Israel’s worship, all 

sacrifices and ceremonies took place “before the Lord.” This teaches us that 

God is always there and that everything we do must be done in light of His 

presence.</p>
<p>
We also learn that God judges sin. Because God is holy, nothing sinful or 

unclean can come into His presence. For human beings to develop a relationship 

with God, they must first be forgiven and cleansed of sin<br>(Lev 1:1–7:38; 

11:1–15:33).</p>
<p>
The book of Leviticus also tells us to:</p>
<p>
Obey God (Lev 17:2).</p>
<p>Worship, serve and obey God only (Lev 17:3-9; 20:1-5).</p>
<p>Recognise God’s blessings (Lev 23:1-44).</p>
<p>Be as concerned about every aspect of our lives as God is (Lev 18:1–22:16).</p>
<p>Deal justly with each other, just as God deals justly with His people <br>(Lev 19:1-

37).</p>
<p>While Jesus is not mentioned in Leviticus, the sacrificial system and the 

office of high priest foreshadow the greater work of Christ for human 

salvation <br>(Heb 3:1; 4:14-16). <br>Heb 7 describes Jesus as our High Priest and 

uses the text of Leviticus as a basis for illustrating His work. Jesus is the 

eternal High Priest whose work far surpasses that of Aaron and his 

successors.</p>

<p>As the author of Hebrews states: <font color= "blue">“But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as He is also Mediator of a better covenant, which was established on better promises” (Heb 8:6)</font>.</p>

<p>Through the crucifixion, Jesus fulfilled the Levitical concept of the sin 

offering (Rom 8:1-4; 2 Cor 5:18-21; Heb 9:1-1-28; 10:11-12; 13:10-15).<br> In 

other passages, Paul described Christ as a peace offering <br>(Rom 5:1-11; Eph 

2:13-18; Col 1:18-20).</p>

<p>Christ’s death and resurrection meant that the Levitical prescriptions for 

sacrifice and holiness have been superseded through Jesus Christ and the 

indwelling of the Holy Spirit (Acts 9:9-:19; 15:1-21; Gal 2:15–3:5).</p>

<p>The concepts of separation and holiness were attractive themes to New 

Testament writers.<br> The apostle Peter reflected the theme of Leviticus when he 

encouraged Christians to <font color= "blue">“be holy in all you do; for it is written: He who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct," (1 Peter 1:15)</font>; (Lev 11:44; 19:2; 20:7).<br> Peter also 

called Christians a <font color= "blue">“royal priesthood, a holy nation” (1 Peter 2:9)</font>.</p>
<h3>
Other topics
</h3>
<p><font size="+1">
Annual festivals</font></p>
<p> 
These festivals and holy days memorialise God’s great acts 

of salvation in history, symbolise the power of God and typify the anticipated 

future fulfilment of God’s plan of salvation for all humanity (Lev 23).</p>
<p><font size="+1">

Tithing</font></p>
<p>Tithing is the practice of giving a tenth of one’s increase to God.<br> 

The Israelites paid 10 percent of their agricultural blessings to the Levites 

(Lev 27). Giving God a tenth of what belongs to Him anyway, recognises 

His ultimate ownership of everything.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Covenant</font></p>
<p>Because God had made His covenant (agreement) with the Israelites, 

it was important that they lived according to His laws. <br>Read Lev 26 and 

note the eight references to “covenant” <br>(Lev 26: 9, 15, 25, 42, 44-45).</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Sacrifice/offering</font></p>
<p>Israel’s sacrifices were to serve as a reminder of sin 

(Heb 10:3). <br>An animal’s life was taken to picture that without the 

shedding of blood there could be no forgiveness (Heb 9:22). But the 

Levitical sacrificial system lasted only until Jesus’ death, the ultimate 

sacrifice for all humanity’s sins.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Levites</font></p> 
<p>The Levites and priests were the ministers of their day. They also 

regulated the moral, civil and ceremonial laws and supervised the health, 

justice and welfare programs of the nation.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Community health</font></p>
 <p>Leviticus contains rules and guidelines regarding food, 

disease and sexual purity. Although some of the laws seem arbitrary, others 

would have promoted hygiene and community health.</p>
<h3>
What this book means for you
</h3>
<p><font size="+1">Maintaining a relationship with God means sin must be removed.</font></p>
<p>
Leviticus reminds us of the holiness of God and the necessity of living a holy 

life. Sin is always serious, because God is holy and cannot live with sin.<br> Sin 

stems from a mode of thinking that is contrary to God, and puts human beings 

in a spiritual category different from God. </p>
<p>
<font size="+1">Obedience to God must be important in our lives.</font></p> <p>Lev 1–16 may be summed up in 

the words of Jesus, <font color= "blue">“Love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all 

your soul, with all your mind and with all your strength” (Mark 12:30)</font>.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Being right with God leads us to be right with others.</font></p> 
<p>Lev 17–27 describes 

godly behaviour toward our neighbours. These chapters can be summarised by Lev 

19:18, <font color= "blue">“Love your neighbour as yourself.”</font></p>
<p>
Family life should be strengthened and protected (Lev 18:6 19:3; 20:10-21).</p>
<p>
The poor should be provided for (Lev 19:9-10).</p>
<p>
All business transactions must be fair (Lev 19:11-13, 35-36).
Nobody should acquire wealth to the hurt of other citizens (Lev 25:8-55).</p>
<p><font size="+1">
Leviticus shows that God cares for His people.</font></p>
<p>
He has thought through our 

problems and given us guidance and direction, not just in spiritual, but also 

in physical matters. He always has an attitude of forgiveness toward us and 

wants to restore us to His fellowship. <br>God can fully restore Christians today 

because Jesus did what the Levitical sacrificial system could only symbolise. 

Only in Christ do we experience the awesome opportunity to come humbly, yet 

boldly, before the throne of grace (Heb 4:16)</p>
