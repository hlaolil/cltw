 God's Challenge to Pharaoh
</h2>
<h3>
Wrath of God
</h3>
<p>
The persecution of God’s people in Egypt brought upon the persecutors the wrath of God which was manifested in ten plagues which were poured out just before the deliverance of Israel. Ex 3:20. These plagues were not only to punish the persecutors but to prove that the God of Israel was mightier than the gods of the Egyptians. Pharaoh was the supreme pontiff, of the pagan religion of Egypt. All idolatrous nations attributed their success in war to the superiority of their gods over those of their enemies. Pharaoh challenged the God of the Hebrews. (Ex 5:2,3). The Egyptians had doubtless taunted the Israelites regarding the weakness of their God because He was not able to deliver them from bondage. They boasted that their gods had brought victory and prosperity to the nation.</p>
<h3>
God’s Answer
</h3>
<p>
God’s answer to the challenge of Pharaoh was the ten plagues which were punishments of the gods of Egypt. Ex 12:12; Num 33:4. Each plague was designed by the Lord to destroy the confidence of the Egyptians in the power and protection of their gods, and to reveal to them the Creator as the God of the Hebrews; that even the creature-objects of their worship were under His control. "The Lord would give the Egyptians an opportunity to see how vain was the wisdom of their mighty men, how feeble the power of their gods, when opposed to the commands of Jehovah. He would punish the people of Egypt for their idolatry, and silence their boasting of the blessing received from their senseless deities. God would glorify His own name, that other nations might hear of His power and tremble at His mighty acts, and that His people might be led to turn from their idolatry and render Him pure worship."</p>
<h2>
Moses' Miracle
</h2>
<h3>
The First Miracle. Exodus 7:8-12.
</h3>
<p>
When Moses and Aaron appeared in the court of Pharaoh claiming to be the spokesmen of the God of the Hebrews, he demanded a miracle as the evidence of their office. Miracles are the usual credentials of a prophet or a messenger of God. The magicians of Egypt, as agents of Satan, performed counterfeit miracles to prove their claim. Their rods were doubtless charmed and stiffened serpents which looked like rods. This was a common trick of the magicians of Egypt. They were jugglers and tricksters of the first class and their "miracles" were counterfeits and "lying wonders" as are all of Satan’s miracles. (2 Thess 2:9). Only God can create. The greatest tricksters of the world today are found in Cairo, Egypt. The final result of the test proved the superiority of Israel’s God. When God began to work for the deliverance of His people, Satan performed miracles to deceive the Egyptians and to counter the work of God for the salvation of His people. </p>
<h2>
The Ten Plagues
</h2>
<h3>
The First Plague. Ex. 7:15-25.
</h3>
<p>
The Egyptians considered the Nile as sacred, and Pharaoh probably went out to it each morning to worship it as a god. It was known as "the Nile-god" and was identified with Ammon-Ra. It was said to be "self-created" and was sometimes called "the Father of all the gods" and "the chief of the waters." The whole nation depended on the River Nile for their water supply and the very existence of the kingdom was dependent on its yearly overflow. "The beneficent Nile, the very life of the state of the people.". It is only natural therefore that a pagan people who worshipped the powers of nature should make a god of this great river. Even many of the creatures that lived in its waters were considered sacred and were objects of worship. The Egyptians bathed in and drank its waters with reverence and with delight believing them to have healing virtues.</p>
<p>
This first plague covered "all the land of Egypt." The "streams" doubtless refer to the branches of the Nile in its delta of which there were seven according to Herodotus. The "rivers" probably refer to the canals, the "ponds" to the natural and artificial lakes and reservoirs and cisterns. A partial remedy was found in digging for clear water in the sand or no one could have lived through the seven days the plague continued. The death of the fish of the river cut off one of their chief food supplies. According to Birch the Egyptians lived to a large extent on fish. This was one reason that the river was worshipped. That which they looked upon as their greatest benefactor was turned into a curse.</p>
<h3>
The Plague of Frogs. Exodus 8:1-6.
</h3>
<p>
Frogs were regarded as sacred by the Egyptians because they lived in the River Nile and were considered the emblem of creative power. One of their gods was called "Heka," and was a frog-headed goddess. The description of these frogs is identical with a species in Egypt today called the "Rana Mosaica," doubtless so named for that very reason. They are very loathsome creatures that crawl instead of hop and which croak constantly. During the plague they were everywhere and couldn’t be killed because they are sacred. They even entered the "ovens" or baking pans. In Egypt the young frogs come out of the Nile in September, and are sometimes so numerous as to be a menace even today. There are historical records of communities where frogs became such a menace that the people had to flee the country to escape them.</p>
<h3>
The Third Plague. Exodus 8:16-18.
</h3
<p>
Many Bible students believe that the weight of authority is in favour of translating the original word, "kinnim," as "gnats" or "mosquitoes." Others say the original word means various kinds of poisonous insects. </p>
<h3>
Blow at Idolatry
</h3>
<p>
This plague was a severe blow to Egyptian idolatry for while it lasted no act of worship could be performed. "No one could approach the altars of Egypt upon whom so impure an insect harboured, and the priests, to guard against the slightest risk of contamination, wore only lined garments, and shaved their heads and bodies every day."
The first two plagues came from the water and the third came from the earth which was also worshipped. The magicians who had imitated the first two plagues now give up the contest and acknowledge their defeat.</p>
<h3>
The Plague of Flies. Exodus 8:20-24; Psalm 105:31.
</h3>
<p>
"Various sorts of flies."—Psalmist. "The dog-fly." This is not the common housefly but a species that constituted a terrible affliction in Egypt. They may have included a kind of beetle which at times appear in the Nile in great numbers and "inflict very painful bites with their jaws; gnaw and destroy clothes, household furniture, leather, and articles of every kind, and even consume all food.". They sometimes drive people out of their houses and they devastate the crops. Beetles were sacred to Ra, the sun-god, and one form of Ra was a man with a beetle head. The Egyptian fly-god, Beelzebub was reverenced as the protector from ravenous swarms of insects which infested the land at certain seasons. This plague demonstrated the impotence of the fly-god to protect the Egyptians, and Pharaoh begged Moses and Aaron to entreat Jehovah to remove the curse.</p>
<h3>
Israel Protected
</h3>
<p>
Beginning with the fourth plague the land of Goshen was cut off from the rest of Egypt and Israel was protected. The first three plagues were universal but the last seven of the ten affected the Egyptians only. (Ex 8:22, 23; 9:6, 26; 10:23). 
The swarms of flies of all sorts "filled the houses and swarmed upon the ground, so that "the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies." These flies were large and venomous; and their bite was extremely painful to man and beast. As had been foretold, this visitation did not extend to the land of Goshen."</p>
<h3>
The Fifth Plague. Exodus 9:1-7.
</h3>
<p>
The fifth plague was anthrax amongst the livestock of the Egyptians. This judgement was aimed at the entire system of Egyptian brute-worship as representatives of the sun, moon, and stars. They worshipped the sacred bull, Apis, the calf, Nmevis, and also heifers, rams, goats, and other animals. In those days wealth was reckoned mostly in livestock. The Israelites were especially a pastoral people and the sparing of the land of Goshen was an evidence to Pharaoh that it was a divine judgement demonstrating the superiority of Jehovah over the gods of Egypt.</p>
<h3>
The Sixth Plague. Exodus 9:8-11.
</h3>
<p>
The boils of the sixth plague broke out in blisters. This is doubtless what is referred to in Deut 28:27, as "the botch of Egypt" which caused an itching sensation and was incurable. In Egypt there were several altars on which human sacrifices were offered in time of plague and disease, the victim being burned alive. The ashes were gathered by the priests and thrown into the air and wherever they fell they were supposed to stop the ravages of the disease by propitiating Typhon, or the "Evil Principle." The furnace was the emblem of the bitter slavery and sufferings of the Hebrews in Egypt. Gen 15:17; Deut 4:20. This act of Moses in sprinkling the ashes toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh indicated that the plague came as the result of the cruel bondage which consumed the Israelites in the furnace of affliction. Fire is the greatest of all germ destroyers and the Lord demonstrated His power by producing disease germs from the ashes or "soot of the furnace."</p>
<h3>
The Seventh Plague. Exodus 9:22-34.
</h3>
<p>
This plague was a severe hail storm mingled with lightning and thunder. An electric storm often comes with hail. The cattle and people who were unprotected were wounded and many killed. The flax and barley crops, which were almost ready for the sickle, were destroyed. They matured in March while the wheat and rye harvests came more than a month later. Flax was used in making garments. (See Psa 105:32,33).</p>
<h3>
The Eighth Plague. Exodus 10:1-15.
</h3>
<p>
The plague of locusts is also described in Psa 105:34,35. They destroyed everything in the vegetable kingdom that was left by the hail. (See Joel 2:3,5). Many writers tell how locusts bark the trees after stripping them of the leaves. "When their swarms appear everything green vanishes instantaneously from the fields, as if a curtain were rolled up; the trees and plants stand leafless, and nothing is seen but naked boughs and stalks." (During 1932 in South Africa swarms of locust 500 miles wide and 1500 miles long devastated portions of the country).</p>
"They shall fill thy houses." (Ex 10:6). They penetrated by thousands into the dwellings, and devoured whatever they can find, even the leather of the water vessels. The Egyptian windows were lattice-work and made it easy for the locusts to enter.

Came With East Wind. v. 13.
Locusts are not common in Egypt and they come from other countries and usually from Arabia in Asia to the East. North Arabia is noted for its locusts and they generally travel with the East wind. Ex 10:14 tells us that the plague covered "all the land of Egypt." Egypt was about 520 miles long and only about 20 miles wide in the delta.  According to Ex 10:19 the locusts departed out of Egypt with a West wind. They left as suddenly as they came which is a characteristic of these insects. This judgement was directed at Serapis, whose office was to protect the country from locusts. Forty-two temples had been erected in honour of this deity. At the command of Moses the locusts came and at his command they departed and Serapis was powerless.</p>
<h3>
The Ninth Plague. Exodus 10:21-23.
</h3>
<p>
The ninth plague was the darkness that could be felt.  They could not see one another during this plague. While it lasted no man rose from his place; men and beasts hid themselves; the inhabitants of towns and villages shut themselves up in their houses. 
There was light in the dwellings of the Israelites. This plague was directed at Isis and Osiris representing the sun and moon who were supposed to control the light and the elements. Jehovah in this plague summoned nature to proclaim Him the true God.</p>
<h3>
The Tenth and Last Plague. Exodus 12:12, 29-32.
</h3>
<p>
The slaying of the first-born of man and beast was the most terrible of the ten plagues. The first-born of both man and beast were given special privileges and were considered sacred. Pharaoh in his palace was more or less protected personally from the other plagues, but this one entered the royal palace and slew the crown-prince and heir to the throne. It caused Pharaoh to acknowledge the defeat of his gods by a superior God before whose power he yields. He tells Israel to go and asks for a parting blessing. (Ex 12:32).</p>
<h2>
The Deliverance of Israel
</h2>
<h3>
The Passover. Exodus 12:3-14.
</h3>
<p>
Escape from the tenth and last plague of Egypt was possible only to the Israelites who sprinkled the blood of the slain lamb on the door-posts of their dwellings. As the angel of death passed through the land of Egypt he passed over the homes of those who had the sign of the blood. As far as the record goes, this is the only thing ever required of the Israelites to protect themselves from the plagues. Because their homes were passed over and their first born protected the deliverance was called the Passover and under divine direction a memorial was instituted to commemorate the event.</p>
<h3>
Mark of God. Exodus 12:13.
</h3>
<p>
The sprinkled blood on the door-posts was a token of redemption, a sign of God’s ownership, a pledge of security, and a mark of obedience. This mark secured the safety of those who exhibited it from the wrath and judgements of God. Deliverance from bondage and the last plague depended on their faith in the sprinkled blood which was symbolic of the blood of Christ, the Lamb of God. The angel of death passed over every home that had the mark of God’s approval and protection. His avenging sword was unsheathed in every other household in the land. The mark was an outward sign of obedience and showed that the inmates were worshippers of the true God and were obedient to His will.</p>
<h3>
Delivered at Midnight. Exodus 11:4; 12:29.
</h3>
<p>
The deliverance of Israel under the Exodus from Egypt took place at midnight during the last plague. The preparation necessary was to have the blood sprinkled on the door-posts and to have everything packed up and ready to move. They were to be dressed with their sandals on their feet and their staves in their hands. Ex 12:11-13. Exactly at midnight the angel of death to the Egyptians and of deliverance to the Israelites passed through the land. There arose a wail of woe from the Egyptians and a shout of deliverance from the people of God. The hosts of Israel had been organised for the journey and all preparations had been made. The 430 years were ended and the prophetic movement started from Egypt to Canaan, from bondage to freedom.</p>
<h3>
The Death Sentence
<p>
The final deliverance of the Israelites took place at the Red Sea as they passed out of the dominion of Egypt. Here they were delivered from the sentence of death which was the final act in the drama of their Egyptian pilgrimage. Pharaoh’s decree was that they be brought back into bondage or destroyed. Ex 15:9. God’s people were apparently in a trap with no human possibility of escape. The outlook from their viewpoint seemed hopeless. They must either return to Egypt to a more cruel bondage or face the sentence of death. It was a test of faith and the deliverance was sudden and unexpected. The Lord opened up the Red Sea and led them to freedom.</p>
<h3>
Also at Midnight
</h3>
<p>
The deliverance at the Red Sea took place at night. All night they were protected by a guard of angels between them and the enemy. According to Ex 14:24,25, the Egyptians were destroyed during the morning watch which came between two in the morning and sunrise. Since several millions of men, women and children had to make the journey with all their belongings including live-stock, it doubtless required several hours to make the passage. The Red Sea at this point is estimated to have been at least one mile and probably five miles wide or even more. The 600 chariots of Pharaoh with perhaps 100,000 soldiers were in the midst of the passage in the morning watch. This would make the opening of the Red Sea for their deliverance about midnight.</p>
<h3>
Death-Sentence Reversed
</h3>
<p>
The sentence of death decreed upon the Israelites returned upon the heads of the Egyptians. Ex 14:24-30. The enemies of God’s people were all destroyed and the Israelites were delivered from them forever. "There remained not so much as one of them." In connection with the destruction of the Egyptians, there took a place a terrific storm accompanied by thunder, lightning and earthquakes. Psa 77:15-20. </p>
<h3>
Song of Deliverance
</h3>
<p>
With their own eyes the Israelites witnessed the destruction of their enemies and saw their dead bodies along the shore. The song of deliverance is called "the song of Moses" because it was doubtless composed by him to commemorate the event and to celebrate their triumph. The song is divided into two parts. Ex 15:1-12 celebrate the deliverance that had just been experienced. Ex 15:13-18 are prospective of the results that were to come in the future because of the Red Sea deliverance. Ex 15:19-21 give us the sequel to the song, giving its historic background and the part Miriam played in the celebration.</p>
