The Cloud, Manna, Spies and Snakes
</h1>
<p>
<h3>	
The Pillar of Cloud
</h3>
<p>
<font color= "blue">The Lord went before them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so as to go by day and night. <<br>(Ex 13:21-22)</font></p>
<p> 
When the chariots of Egypt met up with the Israelites at the Red Sea, the cloud changed position and stood between the Israelites and the Egyptians in such a way that the Egyptians were unable to come after the Israelites. <br>(Ex 14:19-20) <br>The Lord divided the waters of the Red Sea, and when Pharaoh’s soldiers tried to follow, the Lord looked through the pillar of cloud and <font color= "blue">“He troubled the army of the Egyptians.” (Ex 14:24)</font> <br>This cloud was the leading factor in the lives of the Israelites. It led them to Sinai. It was present when Israel tragically put herself under the Law, when the Israelites made and worshipped the golden calf, when the original tables of stone were broken by Moses, and during the building of the Tabernacle. When the tabernacle was finished, the <font color= "blue">
“cloud covered the tabernacle of meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.” (Ex 40:34)</font></p>
<p>
The presence of the Lord with the people was not only the seal that they were His, but it indicated that they were a separated people.<br> Just as the pillar of cloud separated God’s people from the Egyptians pursuing them, if you have His presence in a real way through the Holy Spirit, it will separate you from those who do not have Him. (See Ex 14:19-20)</p>
<h3>
What Was Manna?
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
And as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the people of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory of The Lord appeared in the cloud. And The Lord said to Moses, "And the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, “I have heard the complaints of the children of Israel. Speak to them, saying, At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread. And you shall know that I am the Lord your God.” 
So it was that quails came up at evening and covered the camp, and in the morning the dew lay all around the camp. And when the layer of dew lifted, there, on the surface of the wilderness, was a small round substance, as fine as frost on the ground. So when the children of Israel saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?” For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, “This is the bread which the Lord has given you to eat. (Ex 16:10-15)</font></p>
<p>
The word manna is derived from the The Hebrew words meaning, What is it? Although some have speculated that manna was some sort of naturally-occurring substance that God miraculously multiplied and delivered to the Israelites, there is no solid proof for that possibility. If it were something natural to the desert region however, very near to where the Israelites had been living for over 400 years, would they have had to ask what it was?</p>
<p>
What we do know for sure is:<br>
<font color= "blue">"Now the manna was like coriander seed, and its colour like the colour of bdellium.(Aromatic gum resin; similar to myrrh) 
The people went about and gathered it, and ground it on millstones or beat it in the mortar, and cooked it in pans, and made cakes of it; and its taste was like the taste of pastry prepared with oil." (Num 11:7-8)</font></p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"When the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell on it." <br>(Num 11:9)</font></p>
<p>
During first five work days of the week, the people were only to gather enough for that day, because it would badly spoil before long (Ex 16:19-20). On the sixth day however, they were to gather enough for two days because no manna came down during the Sabbath. The manna supplied on the sixth day did not spoil like it did on the other days (See Ex 16:23-26)
The manna began about one month after the Exodus, and they ate it during the entire 40 years of the Wilderness Journey (Ex 16:35).
The manna stopped immediately after they entered the Promised Land under the leadership of Joshua:<br>
<font color= "blue">
"Now the children of Israel camped in Gilgal, and kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at twilight on the plains of Jericho. And they ate of the produce of the land on the day after the Passover, unleavened bread and parched grain, on the very same day. Then the manna ceased on the day after they had eaten the produce of the land; and the children of Israel no longer had manna, but they ate the food of the land of Canaan that year." (Joshua 5:10-12)</font></p>
<p>
Jesus Christ spoke of manna, revealing its true significance:<br>
<font color= "blue">
"Our fathers ate the manna in the desert; as it is written, "He gave them bread from heaven to eat." Then Jesus said to them, “Most assuredly, I say to you, it  Moses did not give you the bread from heaven; but My Father gives you the true bread from heaven. For the bread of God is He who comes down from heaven, and gives life to the world." (John 6:31-33)</font> and, </p>
<p><font color= "blue">
"I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and  are dead. This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat of it and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If any one eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and the bread that I shall give is My flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world.” (John 6:48-51)</font></p>

<h3>
The Tragedy of the Spies
</h3>
<p>
After a year at Mount Sinai, the people of Israel packed up their portable sanctuary and came to the borders of the Land of Israel.
They should have entered the land at this point, but the people of Israel came to Moses and said, “Wait a minute, let’s scout out the land first before we enter.”
So they selected 12 “scouts” or “spies”—one from each of the 12 tribes—and sent them in to do some reconnaissance work.</p>
<p>
We have to spend a little time talking about the tragedy of the spies, because the implication of this event is going to reverberate throughout all of people of Israel's history. It’s going to put into place one of the most significant and certainly most depressing dates in the Jewish calendar. Virtually every major disaster in people of Israel's history is going to be connected to this day—which is the exact date when both the first and second Temples were destroyed.</p>
<p>
Again, actions of the Jews have had huge consequences which reverberate throughout history. The people of Israel have suffered throughout history because of that mistake they made “back then.” So what was the terrible mistake of the spies?</p>
<p>
These 12 spies spent 40 days scouting out the land and they came back with a huge cluster of grapes saying, “You all see the size of these grapes?<br> You should see the size of some of the people who eat them. They are giants! No way can we beat them. We may as well go back to Egypt.”<br>
Only two of the spies do not agree with this report: Joshua, who is Moses’ chief student, and Caleb from the tribe of Judah.
But the people of Israel accept the majority report of the spies. The people break down in tears at the news and refuse to budge.
Moses is absolutely horrified and God is very angry. 
He issue two decrees of punishment:</p>
<p>
God tells the people of Israel that because they displayed this lack of faith after He had brought them so far, they are doomed to wander in the desert for 40 years (One year for every day they spied out the land) until the entire adult male population (except for the Levites who did not listen to the spies) had died off. (The women, who always carried the standard of faith in Judaism, didn’t listen to the spies and lived to go into the land.)</p>
<p>
God tells the people of Israel that because they cried on this day for no good reason, they will cry on this day in history for some very good reasons.</p>
<h3> 
Complaining, Snake bites and Salvation 
</h3>
<p>
The Old Testament speaks of a gripe session of a similar sort. <br>The Israelites were wandering in the desert. Why were they wandering? - Because they refused to trust God’s leading. They had been led right to the border of the Promised Land, but they were afraid to enter.<br> They didn’t believe God would usher them as victors into the land He had led them to. And so they wandered in the desert. And then they began to fuss and fume. Only problem – they picked the wrong person to criticise. <br>(read Numbers 21:4-9)</p>
<p>
The sin of the Israelites was to criticise God. Their spirits were not faithful to God. They refused to trust God’s love and care. They forgot the miracles God had done for them. In short, they were so focused on themselves and what they thought was best that they begin to grumble and speak words that wound – words that were harsh. It’s bad enough to do this to another person, but these desert wanderers directed their words against God.</p>
<p>
And the consequences came upon them almost immediately.<br><font color= "blue">
So the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and many of the people of Israel died.” (Num 21:6) </font><br>
The implication is that the bite of these fiery serpents produced an extreme amount of pain. The text tells us that these serpents bit many of the people and they died.</p>
<p>
It is clear that the Lord was trying to send a message to the people. <br>He wanted to show them that their rebellion was causing them to suffer.<br> Many of them were going to early graves because of their transgressions.<br>But God was also sending a subtle message here – it had to do with the serpents – the snakes. Do you remember the way that sin entered the world in the Garden of Eden? That first sin was a sin of rebellion – a disobedience of God that was ushered into the world by Satan in the form of a serpent - and it brought death. And now the rebellious, God criticising, desert wandering people were again being sent to early graves through the work of other serpents.</p>
<p>
<img src="../../../images/content/RH-MosesAndBronzeSerpent.jpg" width="170" height="230" hspace="10" vspace="0" border="0" align="left" alt="">And so the people – in the throes of agony – recognised their sin.<br> 
<font color= "blue">
"The people came to Moses, and said, “We have sinned, for we have spoken against the Lord and against you; pray to the Lord that He take away the serpents from us.” So Moses prayed for the people. 
Then the Lord said to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a pole; and it shall be that everyone who is bitten, when he looks at it, shall live.” So Moses made a bronze serpent, and put it on a pole; and so it was, if a serpent had bitten anyone, when he looked at the bronze serpent, he lived. (Num 21:7-8)</font></p>
<p>
I’d like to make a couple of observations about the goings on we’ve just discussed. 
First, I’d like for us to notice that God didn’t remove the snakes from the camp. The consequences of sin remained with the Israelites. <br>They were still bitten – still felt the fiery poison. But what God did provide was salvation from death. He allowed the Israelites who trusted God to avoid perishing as a result of sin.</p>
<p>
The second observation I’d like to make is that the solution God provided was, I think, a reminder. Think about it – the figure of a bronze snake on a wooden pole – look at it after a fiery serpent bites you and you will live! Sounds weird. God didn’t provide a sophisticated snake serum. He didn’t enable the healers to develop an amazing cure. He didn’t create a special liturgy or ceremony that the priests could use to save the snake bit. He just said, “Look at the bronze snake on the wooden pole.”</p>
<p>
Why a snake, I wonder? Was God trying to cast a shadow back to the original problem – the serpent in the Garden? Was God trying to force people to look at and confess the root of the problem – sin? You see, it sure is easy to focus on the symptoms – the little white lies, the sinful desires, the lusts, the laziness, the judgementalness. Focusing on the symptom – the snake bite – the rebellion in our hearts – tempts us to try to find a solution in a self-help book. Maybe we could use leggings to avoid the snake bites; we could carry an anti-venom kit. We could exercise so that our reflexes could allow us to out jump the snake. But none of those things will do the trick.<br> That’s why Paul wrote in our New Testament: <font color= "blue">
“For by grace you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God,not of works, lest anyone should boast.” (Eph 2:8-9)</font>
<p>
Self-help does not cut it – and so God asks us to lift up the problem – our sin – our rebellion – our untrusting and unloving hearts. He asks us to be up-front with this aspect of our lives. Look at the snake – remember the rebellion and sin in the Garden; remember the rebellion and sin in the desert; remember the rebellion and sin in your life. He asks us to come right up to Him as we face our sin – and He will heal us and forgive us.</p>
<p>
Fast-forward about 1500 years ... Jesus applied this well-known event to His own lifting up on the cross. He said, <font color= "blue">
“And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up,that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life.” (John 3:14-15)</font><br>
 This was why Jesus came into the world – to become the real salvation of the people - to be raised between heaven and earth on a cross. By dying this way, He would draw all people to Himself. And just like God promised salvation to those who looked at the bronze snake on the pole – Jesus promises eternal life to those who trust in God’s Word and look to the cross for their salvation.</p>
