Genesis Ends and Exodus Begins
</h1>
<p>
The book of Genesis is about the beginning. The stories of Adam and Eve up to Joseph in Egypt.</p>
<p> 
400 years after Joseph died the Israelites, enslaved by the Egyptians, were living in misery. 
The book of Exodus details God's call to the people of Israel to get up and leave their position of slavery in Egypt. <br>Exodus records more miracles of God than any other book in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>
God rescues and delivers His people as He guides them into the unfamiliar desert. There God institutes His system of laws, gives instruction in worship and establishes His people as the nation of Israel.<br> 
Exodus is a book of tremendous spiritual significance.<br>
Moses is credited as the author of the Book of Exodus.<br>
Date Written: 1450-1410 B.C.<br>
Written to:
The people of Israel and the people of God for all generations to come.</p>
<h3>
Landscape of the Book of Exodus
</h3>
<p>
Exodus begins in Egypt where the people of God have been living in slavery to Pharaoh. As God delivers the Israelites, they move into the desert by way of the Red Sea and eventually come to Mount Sinai in the Sinai Peninsula.</p>
<h3>
Themes in the Book of Exodus
</h3>
<p>
There are several significant themes in the book of Exodus.<br> Israel's slavery is a picture of man's slavery to sin. Ultimately only through God's divine guidance and leadership can we escape our slavery to sin. However, God also directed the people through the godly leadership of Moses. <br>Typically God also leads us into freedom through wise leadership and through His word.</p>
<p>
The people of Israel had been crying out to God for deliverance. He was concerned about their suffering and He rescued them. Yet Moses and the people had to exercise courage to obey and follow God.</p>
<p>
Once free and living in the desert, the people complained and began to yearn for the familiar days of Egypt. Often the unfamiliar freedom that comes when we follow and obey God, feels uncomfortable and even painful at first. <br>If we trust God He will lead us into our Promised Land.</p>
<p>
The institution of the law and the Ten Commandments in Exodus reveals the emphasis and importance of choice and responsibility in God's kingdom. <br>God blesses obedience and punishes disobedience.</p>

And the Lord said: “I have surely seen the oppression of My people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows. So I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up from that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites. Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to Me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them. Come now, therefore, and I will send you to Pharaoh that you may bring My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt." (Ex 3:7-10)</font></p>
<p><p><font color= "blue">
And God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM.” And He said, “Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, "I AM has sent me to you.” Moreover God said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: "The Lord God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This is My name forever, and this is My memorial to all generations".<br> (Ex 3:14-15)<p></font></p>
<p><p><font color= "blue">
Then Moses said to the Lord, “O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither before nor since You have spoken to Your servant; but I am slow of speech and slow of tongue.” So the Lord said to him, “Who has made man’s mouth? Or who makes the mute, the deaf, the seeing, or the blind? Have not I, the Lord? <br>(Ex 4:10-11)<p></font></p>
