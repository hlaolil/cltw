The Effect of Sin
</h3>

" But the children of Israel committed a trespass regarding the accursed things, for Achan took of the accursed things; so the anger of the Lord burned against the children of Israel." (Josh 7:1)</font>.</p>
<p>
We find it strange that God should blame the whole nation saying "the children of Israel committed a trespass" all for the sin of a single man. If they had half a million troops involved in the conquest of Jericho, you might reason, you can't expect perfection. One of them, at least, will disobey orders. Why should the whole nation suffer for the greed of one?</p>
<p>
Why indeed? But in time of war, you must agree, one soldier who fires prematurely can alert the enemy and destroy the whole army. One person who shares a secret can expose an entire nation to defeat. Real life demonstrates that all can suffer for the sins of a single man.<br>
This passage indicates that sin affects not only us, but also the people around us. Instead of constantly pointing out the sins of others, we need to examine our own hearts and ask God to root out our own sins so we might not injure others in the body and in our families.</p>
<h3>
The Sin of Greed
</h3>
<p>
The particular sin that Achan committed was the sin of greed and stealing. He saw something of great value that belonged to another and took it. Wasn't it just plunder from battle? you ask. Yes, it was plunder, but it belonged to the King, the Lord. Achan coveted what belonged to God and kept it for himself, and buried in the floor of his tent.</p>
<p>
Perhaps we are just to acknowledge that everything we have is God's, and to resist the greed that puts us into debt so we cannot give generously to God. Few of us can say we've never been where Achan was. There, but for the grace of God, go we. If God took Achan's greed this seriously, how does he view ours?</p>
<p>
Once while Jesus was teaching, a man called out, "Make my brother give me my share of the property." Jesus took this as an occasion for public warning: <font color= "blue">" And He said to them, “Take heed and beware of covetousness, for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of the things he possesses.”" (Luke 12:15)</font>. The man thought he was asking for justice, but Jesus saw the real motivation -- greed -- and called it what it was.</p>
<p>
Lord, free us from the sin of greed, when we cling to that which belongs to you and you only. Amen.</p>
