Formal teaching
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
You shall teach them diligently to your children, ...(Deut 6:7)</font></p>
<p>
There are two commands in Deut 6:7. First, we are instructed to "teach them diligently to our sons." This describes formal teaching. </p>
<p>
The father is responsible for diligently teaching his children. Interestingly, we do not see God charging pastors, elders or Sunday School teachers to do this. We must, therefore, refuse any tendency to pass off our responsibility as fathers to formally teach our children. Instead, we are to embrace our responsibility as a charge from God. What are we to do as fathers?</p>
<p>
We need to teach God's Words diligently to our sons. The content of our instruction is God' s words or commands. We need to teach them both the positive and negative commands. Since many of the commands are set within the contexts of interesting historical situations, we are also God communicates with children through the fathers.to recite those narratives. The Lord brings that 'God-conscious' perspective to our children through us as fathers. This in turn brings great blessing to our lives.</p>
<p>
With a little observation of the typical Christian father, we can see why many children of Christian families go wayward. The fathers simply don't teach their children. Some children have heard their fathers teach others but not themselves.
Actually, I myself didn't get a hold of this truth until recently when I was pondering how my children were going to be any differently prepared to face the wild world out there than other children. It was then that I realised that though I personally discipled others, I did not disciple my own children one on one.
I knew the advantage of personal discipleship but would not apply it to my own situation. I was humbled by my neglect of personally meeting with my two older daughters. i decided i would start meeting regularly with my oldest son and teach him God's Word.</p>
<p>
After I had understood more of the procedure and need, I expanded to meeting personally with each of my young children that can read. I did not totally neglect my older children. We have had family devotions each night since the beginning, but this personal formal input of God's word into their lives has become a very important building time.
One of the greatest problems with this concept of family devotions or personal discipling of our child is that the father usually does not know God's Word very well. It is to a father's shame if he does not love God and His Word. Their children will reject their empty religion because that is all it has become. If a father really loved God, then he would really love and study God's Word and pass it on to his children.</p>
<p>
Another obstacle for fathers is the notion that they are not gifted teachers. In other words, they believe that only the few gifted teachers can teach. It is urgent that we reject this need for fathers to be gifted teachers to instruct their children. Let us ask what the Word of God asks of us fathers. Does He our Lord not teach us that we should love His Word and teach our sons? Yes. Then lets not let this notion of being a gifted teacher get in the way. If we expose ourselves regularly to God and His Word, then He Himself will give us things to teach. We can teach what He teaches us.</p>
<p>
Along with this wrong notion is the thought that only those trained in seminaries can rightfully teach doctrine. This is nonsense. Again, it goes clearly against what we have learned from this charge to fathers. Fathers are responsible to teach their sons. Eph 4 actually tells us that pastors and teachers are to equip God's people. This means that God charges pastors and teachers to exhort and instruct God's people.
Among them are many fathers. These fathers are then to instruct their children. Fathers are responsible to teach their own children. Every father has to work out this formal instruction. Without it the children will be missing out. We have chosen to home school. this gives us even more opportunities to instruct our children using God's Word rather than secular curriculum.</p>
<h3>
Informal Teaching
</h3>
<p>
... and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise up. (Deut 6:7).</p>
<p>
Secondly we are to "talk of" His ways. This is informal teaching.
This passage catches fathers off guard. Some fathers do have family devotions with their children, but many are too busy to spend any significant time engaging in worthwhile conversation with them.
This whole approach works only if the father really loves God with his whole heart, mind and with all his strength. This passion for God is normal. Anything else is backsliding. Yesterday, for example, my head was extremely congested with allergies. I hurt but my heart was joyful. When I lay down, I thought about my Lord and His love to me. Later I shared with my children how the Lord kept me from complaining or doubting His care for me during this time. We must share our life experiences with our children. When should a father do this? The passage gives us four settings.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
1. Sitting down in your house.</font></p>
<p>
Some dads make themselves too busy watching television, surfing the web, and going to sports events to spend significant time with their children. Others have the time, but the Lord is not on their hearts. They will talk excitedly about some soccer match, some recent purchase or about some project that they are working on. Their main project should be to know God and His Word. This lack of passion becomes obvious to their sons and daughters. Their hearts go somewhere else but not to Lord. They are only doing what Dad does.</p>
<p><font size="+1">
2. Walking somewhere (today driving or riding).</font></p>
<p>
Often times the father listens to music or some radio show that distracts from conversation. The children love to talk and ask about things. Do you ask them about their day? Do you like to talk to them? They really like to talk to you.
<p><font size="+1">
3. Lying down (getting ready for bed).</font></p>
<p>
In the old days, houses were smaller. Sometimes guys would sleep in one room while the girls in another. This provided a lot of OPPORTUNITIES to share. I remember some of my good conversations with our Dad happened when camping together. Just before going to sleep we talked a bit. If children have their own bedrooms, then the parent should pause and talk with each child before they go asleep. Recount the day a bit. Give them a hug and kiss.
<p><font size="+1">
4. Getting up (early in the morning).</font></p>
<p>
The morning sets the pace and attitude of the day. The father should share some reflections from his morning devotions or say some statements that help the children properly look at each day. The father should be an early riser so that he can help encourage the family when they get up.</p>
<p>
Everyday we face many situations through which the Lord wishes to teach us and then pass those lessons on to our children. We have moved our television to the third floor attic. No cable. They can barely see three stations. It does not distract from our times together downstairs. Mealtimes are another great opportunity to share about what one is learning. We must remind you that informal teaching is not to be the only kind of teaching. It must be a good companion to formal teaching.</p>

“Thorns and snares are in the way of the perverse; he who guards his soul will be far from them” (Prov 22:5).</font> </p>
<p>
Just as human flesh cannot resist sharp objects, but is pierced by them, so to rebel against the Lord is to gain nothing but sorrow. The way of the wicked is as a narrow twisting path through thorns which prick him at every turn, but the Lord makes the way of the righteous a wide avenue without any snags. God’s law of sowing and reaping again. Keeping the soul does not refer to one keeping himself saved, which is God’s work, (Jude 21-24), but rather to his abstention from evil which would hinder his Christian walk and testimony.</p>
<h3>
Training
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it.” (Prov 22:6)</font>
Here is God’s commission to parents, and none need hope that their child will turn out well if they refuse to obey this law. “Train” in all the other appearances of the word is rendered “dedicate,” as in Deuteronomy 20:5. Here it involves: 
(1) Teaching. 
(2) Training. 
(3) Setting a proper example. 
(4) Discipline for transgressions. 
Failure in any one of these will almost invalidate the other three. If God has trusted you with a young life - a child - make meaningful time with that child a non-negotiable of your schedule. As with so many of the Lord’s commands, this one has a promise appended to it, which gives hope to faithful parents whose children may be wayward.</p>
<h3>
Responsibility
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
“The rich rules over the poor, and the borrower is servant to the lender.”(Prov 22:7) </font>  “Some sell their liberty to gratify their luxury,” . Money indeed talks and it often talks with a loud and gruff voice to those who have it not. The poor and the borrower are today protected much by laws, so that there are not the abuses that there once were, but it is still true that those with money exercise a lot of influence over those who have it not, and who must borrow. The high cost of homes, cars, etc., often make borrowing a necessity, but many borrow needlessly to buy luxuries when they could practice self-denial for a time, and labour industriously until they have the where withal to buy without borrowing. So many today have borrowed to the utmost limit so that a bad depression would likely bankrupt most families. We need to get back to the principle of frugality, honest labour and self-denial.</p>
