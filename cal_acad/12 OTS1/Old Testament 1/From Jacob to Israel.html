   <h1>
From Jacob to Israel
</h1>
<h3>
Jacob and Esau
</h3>
<p>
Here we examine a confrontation, between Jacob and Esau, two 

brothers, the sons of Isaac and the grandsons of Abraham, at least 

one of whom is destined to carry on the patriarchal tradition. They 

ultimately give birth to the Jewish people as a covenanted people, 

invested with the task of doing God's will through their polity and 

society.</p>
<p>
The story of the two brothers, Jacob and Esau, is a classic example 

of that dilemma and how God faces it in determining who shall carry 

on the Abrahamic line that will serve His purposes in the development 

of a societal model for the world.<br> Jacob and Esau share both good and 

bad traits upon which to try to build leadership for the future. God 

is faced with having to choose between two combinations of traits and 

to select what would be better for leadership of His people. The 

Bible leaves us with the problem of trying to understand the choice 

between two flawed individuals and what that means for us, the 

readers and students of the Bible in every generation.</p>
<p>
Neither portrait is all that flattering and it is too easy to move 

quickly from them to negative assessments of the individuals 

portrayed without fully understanding their complexities as 

individuals. We must remember that the Bible starts from the 

assumption that all human beings are flawed in one way or another by 

the very nature of things and that its purpose is not to demonstrate 

the flawed character of individuals but to suggest some lessons about 

the problems by choosing among human weaknesses by focusing on human 

strengths, to be prudent in our choices yet to maintain our moral 

vision.</p>
<h3>
Natural Man Versus Covenantal Man
</h3>
<p>
Esau and Jacob are introduced as struggling with each other from the 

womb (Gen 25:22). The homiletic treatment of this has been extensive, 

considering the way each has come to symbolise conflicting dimensions 

of power and authority. The common element uniting both is their 

tremendous energy which must be directed and harnessed. Jacob is to 

become Israel (literally: one who struggles with God) whose energy is 

to be directed by the covenant with God, while Esau will struggle 

with men and animals (nature) to become, in the eyes of the Midrash 

(a verse by verse interpretation of Hebrew Scriptures), the exemplar of 

a non-Jewish imperial ruler.<br>

The future of the two struggling foetuses is foretold by God. The 

fathers of the two nations are struggling. Jacob emerges as he is to 

live the first half of his life, struggling for personal advantage, 

as Jacob, one who grasps at the heel of his brother, trying to get 

out first.</p>
<p>
The twins grow up as very different people. The description of Esau 

as a hunter and man of the field fits with the description of his 

appearance at birth, but that of Jacob as a quiet man, dwelling in 

tents, contradicts the first description of him. Given what follows 

immediately, one senses an irony in this description, although it may 

indicate the other dimension of Jacob's personality which also stays 

with him, namely the desire for a calm existence that remains his 

strong arm through all his struggles.</p>
<h3>
Jacob acquires Esau's birthright
</h3>
<p>
In the second recorded confrontation between the two, Jacob takes 

advantage of Esau's weakness, namely an unthinking impulsiveness, to 

press his advantage in a most unbrotherly way, first acquiring Esau's 

birthright for a bowl of lentils and then his father's blessing. The 

birthright has to do with inheritance of goods and position both. <br>The 

tale is typically biblical. The "bottom line" is that by his actions, 

Esau demonstrates that he does not deserve to be the one who 

continues Abraham's responsibilities and rewards under God's 

covenant, since he does not have the steady, thoughtful qualities 

which are required. <br>Rather than getting his own food, after all, he 

was not really starving to death and Jacob was not the only kitchen 

in the encampment he responded impulsively to a good smell and, in the 

words of Gen 25,<font color= "blue"> "despised his birthright."(Gen 25:34)</font></p>
<p>
Jacob shows his wiliness as well as his greater intelligence and 

forethought. Jacob's eye is always on the main chance; he sees his 

advantage and takes it, perhaps not believing the foolishness of his 

despised, and despising, rival. What he does is not quite honourable, 

though not illegal.<br> The title he gains is at least partially valid, 

although he is insecure enough about it to conspire later with his 

mother to deceive his father so as to gain the blessing for the 

first-born as well (Gen 27). In short, he is "sharp".</p>
<p>
Much later, Esau marries two wives, both Hittite women, that is, 

locals, in violation of Abraham's (and God's) injunction not to take 

wives from among the Canaanite population.<br> Again, one gets the sense 

of a headstrong person who acts impulsively, without sufficient 

thought (Gen 26:34-35). His marriage is described as a vexation to 

both Rebecca and Isaac. Even his father, who has strong affection for 

him, is hurt by his act. This action alone forever rules out Esau as 

the bearer of patriarchal continuity. Esau could have overcome the 

sale of his birthright; as we see in the next chapter, Isaac was 

still prepared to give him the blessing due the first born. But 

acquiring foreign wives meant the detachment of his children from the 

Abrahamic line.</p>
<p>
Both the personal and psychological and the public and national 

dimensions of the rivalry between the two brothers are noteworthy. <br>

Despite the dreadful deception on the part of Jacob and his mother to 

gain Isaac's patriarchal blessing, Jacob's vocation as Isaac's 

legitimate heir in the continued founding of the Jewish people is 

reaffirmed.<br> In essence, the Bible tells us that a bright, calculating 

person who, at times, is less than honest, is preferable as a founder 

over a bluff, impulsive one who cannot make discriminating choices.<br> 

Jacob continues to display characteristics which are later to become 

part of the non-Jewish stereotype of Jews (although they are only 

prominent, not typical, witness the very different characters of 

Abraham and Isaac), while Esau continues to display characteristics 

which are later to become part of the Jewish stereotype of non-

Jews.</p>
<p>
The public and national purposes of this story are, by now, self evident, that the Esaus of the world, however attractive they may 

be in some ways, cannot assume the mantle of Abraham because of their 

personal deficiencies, is already brought to our attention.<br> At the 

very least, the Jacobs are the lesser evil because they can be 

chastened, educated, and redirected. In subsequent chapters God is to 

test and temper Jacob to turn his intelligence and cunning to moral 

ends.</p>
<p>

In essence, what we have here is the climax of a struggle between 

natural man (Esau) and covenantal man (Jacob). Both are presented 

realistically, "warts and all", in the Bible's way. Thus it is not a 

confrontation between good and evil, but a choice between two limited 

and flawed human beings.<br> Esau has the good and bad qualities of 

natural man, principal among them, generosity and impulsiveness, 

the characteristics of natural liberty.<br> Jacob's character is at least 

equally mixed, joining intelligence with guile. Isaac, passive and 

insecure, is easily drawn to Esau, but God chooses Jacob since He can 

bind him by covenant and hopes to restrain his sharpness through the 

constraints of federal liberty, liberty in accordance with the terms 

of the covenant, while natural man simply cannot be restrained except 

by force.</p>
<p>
Once again, God's choices are limited by the realities of human 

frailty. He makes the best choice that He can but we need not 

exaggerate the goodness of one or the badness of the other.</p>
<h3>
Covenant or Contract?
</h3>
<p>
After Jacob steals his father's blessing and enrages Esau, Isaac 

responds to Rebecca's request by sending Jacob off with a second 

blessing, actually commanding him not to take a Canaanite wife and to 

go to the family hearth for one instead (Gen 27). <br>The Bible conveys 

the sense of Isaac as a not-very-strong person, much influenced by 

his wife, attempting to play a role of strength by issuing commands, 

something which even God does not ordinarily do.<br> The reader knows how 

absurd it is for him to be commanding Jacob to do what Rebecca set 

him up to do in the first place to save Jacob's life.</p>
<p>
Isaac transmits Abraham's promise to Jacob for the first time. <br>His 

blessing includes both personal fertility and national promise. <br>Up to 

this point, whatever legitimation Jacob has obtained has been 

obtained by deceit. Here, for the first time, he obtains a blessing 

more or less on his own. Whatever the source of the suggestion and 

the reasons behind it, Isaac knows it is a valid one.<br> Perhaps it also 

brings with it recognition that, with Esau's marriage to a Hittite 

woman, only Jacob can be the bearer of the blessing.<br> Isaac gives it 

fully.</p>
<p>
Shocked by his father blessing Jacob, Esau suddenly realises what his 

Canaanite wife has meant to Isaac. He makes one last attempt to 

remedy the situation by also marrying a first cousin, the daughter of 

Ishmael.<br> The effort to parallel Jacob is both clear and insufficient. 

Ishmael's is not the favoured side of the family.</p>
<h3>
Jacob Encounters God
</h3>
<p>
Jacob leaves home to avoid Esau's wrath and his transformation into a 

man suitable to carry on God's enterprise begins (Gen 28).<br> While Esau 

is left trying desperately to please his father, Jacob confronts God 

for the first time on the road, at Beth El. God proffers His covenant 

to Jacob, who, lacking more than sharpness, immediately turns it into 

a contractual arrangement. The careful reader cannot fail to perceive 

that a new dimension needs to be developed by the clever, often 

devious, younger brother. <br>He has begun his testing.</p>
<p>
Jacob's first encounter with God (Gen 28:10-22) in a Divinely

inspired vision is perfectly appropriate: a ladder set up on the 

earth and reaching to heaven.<br> No one is more of this world than 

devious, scheming, jealous, ambitious Jacob who is here called to 

raise himself heavenward. God could hardly appear to him directly; 

first He had to get his attention. Hence the device of the ladder and 

the heavenly beings going up and down, bringing Jacob's gaze and 

thoughts toward heaven.</p>
<p>
God then becomes very personal in His guarantees and promises to 

Jacob, knowing His customer, as it were. God's revelation to Jacob is 

a reaffirmation of the promise to Abraham in even more practical and 

earthy terms suitably attractive to Jacob, given his character. The 

promises of territory and kith are repeated, along with the statement 

that all the people of the earth will be blessed, that is legitimised 

through Jacob's descendants.</p>
<p>
Jacob's response is equally in character. He is awed by God's 

presence but still tries to make a deal with Him by vowing that if 

God keeps His promise in four specifically personal ways (protection 

on his way, food, clothing, and a safe return home), he will 

acknowledge Him and even reward Him by tithing, to "sweeten the pot" 

for God, as it were, a sure sign of Jacob's contractual approach to 

the matter. <br>Jacob understands that God is not Esau, to be taken 

advantage of in a bargain. Nor is He Isaac, to be deceived. God is a 

real power, hence the deal should be a good one for Him. God does not 

respond to all of this.<br> What is most notable at the end of the 

chapter is God's silence.</p>
<p>
The foregoing chain of events is not a covenant and is not described 

as such but it clearly is presented as having all the elements of a 

pact. It is, indeed, a reaffirmation of the covenant with Abraham on 

God's part which is turned into a kind of contractual arrangement by 

Jacob. <br>Jacob is not morally ready for a covenantal relationship. His 

transformation may have begun but it has just begun. God offers him a 

great promise for the future and Jacob concentrates on the details of 

his present well-being. <br>(Notice that he makes no reference whatsoever 

to the covenantal future in his vow.)<br> Significantly, God, 

understanding Jacob, offers both possibilities. He needs Jacob to 

continue the unfolding of His plan, hence must educate him and bring 

him along.</p>
<p>
The whole incident teaches us about the similarities and differences 

between covenant and contract, how they can be confused with one 

another because of their common emphasis on the freedom and integrity 

of the partners, their roots in negotiation, and the resultant mutual 

obligation, yet how they differ in their scope, in the basis of the 

obligation incurred, and, perhaps most important, in the spirit which 

surrounds and informs them. <br>This relationship between the two species 

of pact is an enduring one, encountered in every situation where one 

or the other is used.<br> There is place for both in our imperfect world, 

not only by using a contractual relationship as a way station toward 

a covenantal one but also for each in its own place and situation, 

but, as much as their relationship to one another should be 

understood, they should not be confused.</p>
<h3>
Jacob Meets His Match
</h3>
<p>
Jacob goes on to meet a greater artist at deception than he, his 

uncle Laban (Gen 29). <br>First, he is deceived in his marriages, thereby 

acquiring two wives, Leah and Rachel, and their handmaidens who are 

to mother the tribes of Israel, and in his work relationships.<br> 

Jacob's hatred for Leah is not explained. One is led to deduce that 

her very presence is a constant reminder to Jacob of how he, the 

deceiver, was deceived in turn, forced into an unwanted marriage and 

seven years' additional free service to his uncle, in order to claim 

his beloved Rachel. Given what we know about Jacob's concern for his 

personal well-being, this was a deception that hurt greatly. Hence 

there is nothing that Leah can do to win her husband's love.</p>
<p>
Here we have another example of Jacob's callousness toward other 

human beings. Leah is caught in a tragic web no less than Esau, and 

Jacob, while not the weaver of either, is very much involved in 

heightening the pain of their respective tragedies.<br> In the end, each 

is somewhat compensated by God; Esau becomes wealthy and powerful in 

his own right (Gen 36), Leah (and her concubine) provide most of 

Jacob's sons, and Jacob loses Rachel (Gen 35). Jacob lives for years 

in the belief that Joseph, his favourite son, is dead (Gen 37), and 

finally is forced to end his days in Egypt (Gen 46). It is through 

Jacob's tempering by life that he is transformed to become 

Israel.</p>
<p>
After twenty years, Jacob and Laban reach the parting of ways, not 

without bitterness, fear, and further deception, causing God to 

intervene to protect Jacob and his household. The end result is a 

covenant between the two men, defining their future relationship by 

separating them one from the other.<br> Up to this point, covenants have 

only been used to bind; here we learn that they can be used to 

separate as well. There are certain relationships that are best 

preserved from a distance and this is certainly one of them. <br>In a 

sense, the covenant is a sign of the good sense of the two principals 

who are both crafty and prudent.</p>
<h3>
Jacob Becomes Israel
</h3>
<p>
Jacob moves out of one dangerous situation toward another, both with 

members of his family, Laban and Esau and, on the way, decisively 

confronts God (Gen 32). Through that very mysterious confrontation, 

crafty, self-centred Jacob becomes one who strives or wrestles with 

God, thereby establishing his destiny (Israel) and that of his heirs 

forever. This destiny is to be embodied in the name of the people who 

inherit from him.<br> A new relationship is thereby established, one of 

striving with God.</p>
<p>
There are those who, like Abraham, hearken to God and those, like 

Isaac, who passively accept God's dictates. Jacob has none of the 

characteristics appropriate for either role; witness how he has tried 

to contract with God for protection. But he can be brought to at 

least strive with God, wrestle with Him in the spirit of his 

heritage. Thus, Jacob's wrestling with God completes the patriarchal 

cycle of relationships with the Almighty, from Abraham's powerful and 

dignified service to Isaac's submissiveness to Jacob's ambivalence. <br>

Earlier covenant negotiations give way to wrestling and bargaining 

for a blessing.</p>
<p>
The story is constructed as follows: Jacob completes his arrangement 

with Laban only to learn of Esau's approach with a large body of men 

at his side, frightening Jacob, who takes steps to save as much of 

his people and property as he can if there is trouble, without 

resorting to force of arms. Jacob has no military resources at his 

disposal so he can only manoeuvre, another paradigm of the Jewish 

condition throughout much of Jewish history.</p>
<p>
He then turns to God in a very carefully phrased prayer (as we would 

expect, his every move and word reflects forethought):<br>
<font color= "blue">
"I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies and of all the truth 

which You have shown Your servant; for I crossed over this Jordan 

with my staff, and now I have become two companies. Deliver me, I 

pray, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear 

him, lest he come and attack me and the mother with the children. For 

You said, ‘I will surely treat you well, and make your descendants as 

the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude" (Gen 10

-12)</font>.<br>
Every element is appropriate in a petition which is, at the same 

time, the opening of a negotiation. Jacob terms God's response to His 

servants the patriarchs, loving expressions of covenant obligation 

and true manifestations of covenant loyalty.</p>
<p>
The third element in Jacob's preparations is the assembly of gifts 

for Esau on a grand scale and the arrangement for their presentation 

in the most effective way, prior to their meeting and in waves, to 

soften him up for the actual encounter.<br> What we have before us is 

vintage Jacob in a defensive posture, prudent, crafty, careful, 

covering all his bets. He divides his camp so that at least half of 

his wealth is likely to be preserved, he asks God's help in a 

carefully constructed prayer, he not only arranges to present Esau 

with abundant gifts but takes care to arrange the manner of their 

delivery, and then he secretly transfers his immediate family to 

safety, just in case.</p>
<p>
Finally alone by his own doing, Jacob is now open to the climax of 

his life, the encounter with the mysterious stranger who speaks in 

the name of God. <br>In the wrestling that follows, Jacob displays two of 

his strongest characteristics, tenacity and the ability to make it 

pay. Jacob wrestles the stranger to the point where he can ask for a 

blessing.</p>
<p>
As his blessing, Jacob's name is changed, to Israel. Unlike the firm 

faith of Abraham and the accepting faith of Isaac, Jacob wrestles 

with God all his life, doing His will only after that wrestling.<br> This 

becomes his people's destiny until the end of days. Thus it is the 

unique destiny of the Jews, Israel, to wrestle with God as well as be 

witness to His covenant. Israel's future is not one of blind faith 

and obedience to God's will but one of difficult covenant 

partnership, of wrestling with their own inclinations and doubts in 

the face of a mystery which will not fully reveal itself.<br> Covenants 

do not necessarily end strife; they contain it within a framework or, 

better, within certain bonds. In that sense, the imagery of the 

conflict between Jacob and the stranger is paradigmatic. The Jews are 

still holding the mystery in their arms and will not let go without a 

blessing, while it grasps the hollow of their thighs.</p>
<p>
Jacob perceives what has happened to him, that he has seen the face 

of God and that his destiny is now changed. At the same time, he has 

acquired a permanent limp because of his wounded thigh. One does not 

emerge from such a conflict without some scar.</p>
<p>
Jacob, now Israel, is ready for his confrontation with Esau, 

prudently prepared by his own agency and properly chastised yet 

blessed by Divine agency. <br>The confrontation continues the saga of the 

complex relationship between the two brothers and sharpens the 

biblical description of natural versus covenantal man. <br>Esau remains as 

open and impulsive as Jacob is prudent and crafty. <br>Jacob determines 

to make peace between them but to keep their relationship at arm's 

length.<br> After his three confrontations, Jacob reaches Canaan and 

begins to settle into a new set of tribulations.</p>
