   <h1>
The Bible and its Origins
</h1>
<p>
The English word "Bible" comes from bíblia in Latin and bíblos in Greek.<br> The term means book, or books, and may have originated from the ancient Egyptian port of Byblos (in modern-day Lebanon), where papyrus used for making books and scrolls was exported to Greece.</p>
<p>
Other terms for the Bible are the Holy Scriptures, Holy Writ, Scripture, or the Scriptures, which mean sacred writings.</p>
<p>
The Bible is a compilation of 66 books and letters written by more than 40 authors during a period of approximately 1,500 years. Its original text was communicated in just three languages.<br> The Old Testament was written for the most part in Hebrew, with a small percentage in Aramaic. <br>The New Testament was written in Koine Greek.<br>
Going beyond its two main sections--the Old and New Testament--the Bible contains several more divisions: the Pentateuch, the Historical Books, the Poetry and Wisdom Books, the books of Prophecy, the Gospels, and the Epistles.
<h2>
Divisions of the Books of the Bible.
</h2>
<p>
Originally, the Holy Scriptures were written on scrolls of papyrus and later parchment, until the invention of the codex. A codex is a handwritten manuscript formatted like a modern book, with pages bound together at the spine within a hard cover.</p>
<p>
<h3>Old Testament Books of the Bible
</h3>
<p>
The 39 books of the Old Testament were written over a period of approximately 1,000 years, beginning with Moses (around 1450 B.C.) until the time when the Jewish people returned to Judah from exile (538-400 B.C.) during the Persian Empire. <br>The English Bible follows the order of the Greek translation of the Old Testament (the Septuagint), and thus differs in order from the Hebrew Bible. For the sake of this study, we will consider the divisions of Greek and English Bibles only.<br> Many English Bible readers may not realise that the books are ordered and grouped according to style or type of writing, and not chronologically.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">The Pentateuch</font></p>
<p>
Written more than 3,000 years ago, the first five books of the Bible are called the Pentateuch. The word Pentateuch means "five vessels," "five containers," or "five-volume book."<br> For the most part, both Jewish and Christian tradition credit Moses with primary authorship of the Pentateuch. <br>These five books form the theological foundation of the Bible.</p>
<p>Genesis</p>
<p>Exodus</p>
<p>Leviticus</p>
<p>Numbers</p>
<p>Deuteronomy</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">The Historical Books of the Bible</font></p>
<p>
The next division of the Old Testament contains the Historical Books.<br> These 12 books record the events of Israel's history, beginning with the book of Joshua and the nation's entry into the Promised Land until the time of its return from exile some 1,000 years later.<br> As we read these pages of the Bible, we relive incredible stories and meet fascinating leaders, prophets, heroes and villains.</p>
<p>Joshua</p>
<p>Judges</p>
<p>Ruth</p>
<p>1 Samuel and 2 Samuel</p>
<p>1 Kings and 2 Kings</p>
<p>1 Chronicles and 2 Chronicles</p>
<p>Ezra</p>
<p>Nehemiah</p>
<p>Esther</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">The Poetry and Wisdom Books of the Bible</font></p>
<p>
The writing of the Poetry and Wisdom Books spanned from the time of Abraham through the end of the Old Testament. <br>Possibly the oldest of the books, Job, is of unknown authorship.<br> The Psalms have many different writers, King David being the most notable and others remaining anonymous.<br> Proverbs, Ecclesiastes and Song of Songs are primarily attributed to Solomon. Also referred to as "wisdom literature," these books deal precisely with our human struggles and real-life experiences.</p>

<p>Proverbs</p>
<p>Ecclesiastes</p>
<p>Song of Songs</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">The Prophetic Books of the Bible</font></p>
<p>
There have been prophets throughout every era of God's relationship with mankind, but the books of the prophets address the "classical" period of prophecy—during the later years of the divided kingdoms of Judah and Israel, throughout the time of exile, and into the years of Israel's return from exile. The Prophetic Books were written from the days of Elijah (874-853 B.C.) until the time of Malachi (400 B.C.).<br>They are further divided by Major and Minor Prophets</p>
<p><font size="+1">Major Prophets</font></p>
<p>Isaiah</p>
<p>Jeremiah</p>
<p>Lamentations - Scholarship favours Jeremiah as the author of Lamentations. &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The book, a poetic work, is placed here with the Major &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Prophets in English Bibles because of its authorship.</p>
<p>Ezekiel</p>
<p>Daniel - In English and Greek Bible translations, Daniel is considered one of &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the Major Prophets; however, in the Hebrew canon it is part of "The &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Writings."</p>

<h3>
New Testament Books of the Bible
</h3>
<p>
For Christians, the New Testament is the fulfilment and culmination of the Old Testament. What the prophets of old longed to see, Jesus Christ fulfilled as Israel's Messiah and the Saviour of the World.<br> The New Testament tells the story of Christ's coming to earth as a man, his life and ministry, his mission, message, and miracles, his death, burial, and resurrection, and the promise of his return.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">The Gospels</font></p>
<p>
The four Gospels recount the story of Jesus Christ, each book giving us a unique perspective on his life. They were written between A.D. 55-65, with the exception of John's Gospel, which was written around A.D. 85-95.</p>
<p>Matthew</p>
<p>Mark</p>
<p>Luke</p>
<p>John</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">The Book of Acts</font></p>
<p>
The book of Acts, written by Luke, provides a detailed, eyewitness account of the birth and growth of the early church and the spread of the gospel immediately after the resurrection of Jesus Christ. <br>It is considered a New Testament history book about the early church.<br>The book of Acts supplies a bridge connecting the life and ministry of Jesus to the life of the church and the witness of the earliest believers. The work also constructs a link between the Gospels and the Epistles.</p>
<p>
<font size="+1">The Epistles</font></p>
<p>
The Epistles are letters written to the fledgling churches and individual believers in the earliest days of Christianity.<br> The Apostle Paul wrote the first 13 of these letters, each addressing a specific situation or problem. Paul's writings constitute about one-fourth of the entire New Testament.</p>

<p>
<font size="+1">The Book of Revelation</font></p>
<p>
This final book of the Bible, the book of Revelation, is sometimes called "The Revelation of Jesus Christ" or "The Revelation to John." </p>
<p>The author is John, the son of Zebedee, who also wrote the Gospel of John. He penned this dramatic book while living in exile on the Island of Patmos, around A.D. 95-96. At the time, the early Christian church in Asia faced an intense period of persecution.<br>

The book of Revelation contains symbolism and imagery that challenge the imagination and bewilder the understanding. It is believed to be a culmination of end times prophecies. The interpretation of the book has posed a problem for Bible students and scholars throughout the ages.<br>

Although a difficult and strange book, no doubt, the book of Revelation is certainly worthy of study. The hope-filled message of salvation in Jesus Christ, the promise of blessing for his followers, and God's ultimate victory and supreme power are the prevailing themes of the book.</p>
<h3>
The Word of God
</h3>
<p>
The Bible itself claims to be the inspired Word of God, or "God-breathed" <br>(2 Tim 3:16; 2 Peter 1:21). It unfolds as a divine love story between the Creator God and the object of His love--man. In the pages of the Bible we learn of God's interaction with mankind, His purposes and plans, from the beginning of time and throughout history.<br>

The central theme of the Bible is God's plan of salvation--His way of providing deliverance from sin and spiritual death through repentance and faith.<br>In the Old Testament, the concept of salvation is rooted in Israel's deliverance from Egypt in the book of Exodus.<br>
The New Testament reveals the source of salvation: Jesus Christ.<br> By faith in Jesus, believers are saved from God's judgement of sin and its consequence, which is eternal death.</p>
<p>
In the Bible God reveals Himself to us. We discover His nature and character, His love, His justice, His forgiveness, and His truth. Many have called the Bible a guidebook for living the Christian faith.  <font color= "blue"> "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path." (Psa 119:105)</font><br>

On so many levels, the Bible is an extraordinary book, from its diverse content and literary styles to its miraculous preservation down through the ages. While the Bible is certainly not the oldest book in history, it is the only ancient text with existing manuscripts that number in the thousands.</p>
<p>
For a long period in history common men and women were forbidden access to the Bible and its life-transforming truths.<br> Today the Bible is the best selling book of all time, with billions of copies distributed throughout the world in more than 2,400 languages.</p>
