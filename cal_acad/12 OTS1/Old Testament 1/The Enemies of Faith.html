   <h1>
The Enemies of Faith
</h1>
<h3>
The Effect of Sin
</h3>
<p><font color= "blue">
" But the children of Israel committed a trespass regarding the 

accursed things, for Achan took of the accursed things; so the 

anger of the Lord burned against the children of Israel." (Josh 

7:1)</font>.</p>
<p>
We find it strange that God should blame the whole nation saying 

"the children of Israel committed a trespass" all for the sin of a 

single man. If they had half a million troops involved in the 

conquest of Jericho, you might reason, you can't expect 

perfection. One of them, at least, will disobey orders. Why should 

the whole nation suffer for the greed of one?</p>
<p>
Why indeed? But in time of war, you must agree, one soldier who 

fires prematurely can alert the enemy and destroy the whole army. 

One person who shares a secret can expose an entire nation to 

defeat. Real life demonstrates that all can suffer for the sins of 

a single man.<br>
This passage indicates that sin affects not only us, but also the 

people around us. Instead of constantly pointing out the sins of 

others, we need to examine our own hearts and ask God to root out 

our own sins so we might not injure others in the body and in our 

families.</p>
<h3>
The Sin of Greed
</h3>
<p>
The particular sin that Achan committed was the sin of greed and 

stealing. <br>He saw something of great value that belonged to another 

and took it.<br> Wasn't it just plunder from battle? you ask. Yes, it 

was plunder, but it belonged to the King, the Lord. Achan coveted 

what belonged to God and kept it for himself, and buried in the 

floor of his tent.</p>
<p>
Perhaps we are just to acknowledge that everything we have is 

God's, and to resist the greed that puts us into debt so we cannot 

give generously to God.<br> Few of us can say we've never been where 

Achan was. There, but for the grace of God, go we. If God took 

Achan's greed this seriously, how does He view ours?</p>
<p>
Once while Jesus was teaching, a man called out, "Make my brother 

give me my share of the property." Jesus took this as an occasion 

for public warning: <font color= "blue">" And He said to them, 

“Take heed and beware of covetousness, for one’s life does not 

consist in the abundance of the things he possesses.”" (Luke 

12:15)</font>. The man thought he was asking for justice, but 

Jesus saw the real motivation -- greed -- and called it what it 

was.</p>
<p>
Lord, free us from the sin of greed, when we cling to that which 

belongs to you and you only. Amen.</p>
