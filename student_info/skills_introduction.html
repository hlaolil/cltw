    <h1>Course Introduction</h1>
    <p>For lifelong learning at Calvary, seven things go hand-in-hand to shape the e-learning method we use. Allow us to clarify these seven concepts:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Textbook</b>	&ndash;	The main source of your training material &ndash; printed and pdf</li>
      <li><b>Resource CD</b>	&ndash;	A host of resources, web pages, programmes, study helps</li>
      <li><b>Mentor</b>	&ndash;	The person who will help you to study and mark assignments</li>
      <li><b>Related Skills</b>	&ndash;	The training in necessary practical skills to do your job</li>
      <li><b>Practical Work</b>	&ndash;	Extra practical ministry activities you do as Christian worker</li>
      <li><b>Spiritual formation</b>	&ndash;	A concise guide for improving your spiritual life in discipleship</li>
      <li><b>Evaluation</b>	&ndash;	The final analysis of what you have learned and can do</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>1. Textbook </h3>
    <p>A textbook is a printed document which covers a course or module. Courses deal with a specific field within a Faculty or Discipline. They have <strong>10-hour credits</strong> allocated to them in the order of 2 to 12 credits. A <strong>course</strong> is a group of lectures dealing with a specific topic. Many of the <strong>Calvary Academics</strong> Courses are grouped into modules. Modules often have <strong>credits allocated </strong>to them in the order of 7 to 20 credits. A course or module can be taken for credit on its own. Therefore a textbook can either cover one course, a module or a series of courses.</p>
    <p>Our textbooks are either an in-house production (written by one of our writers) or a published work written for the general public or as an academic manual. Some of the in-house productions are up to 250 pages or as little as 20 pages and may have tear-off sections built into them. The smaller textbooks are sometimes called "handouts" if they are printed for a specific class session or series of lectures. </p>
    <p>The <strong>Calvary Academics</strong> material is printed out on paper in order to be accessible to learners without computers. It is also known that reading from paper is three times better than from screen.</p>
    <p>If the textbook is a standard academic work, we may indicate which chapters are to be studied for a specific course. They are mostly chosen from the books provided by Pearson Education and selected in such a way that often the whole book is used. Pearson has many books that have extra resources available such as PowerPoint presentations, Tutor notes and Test banks.</p>
    <h3>2. Resource CD</h3>
    <p>The CD contains the course material as a pdf (in <strong>p</strong>ortable <strong>d</strong>ocument <strong>f</strong>ormat). Other useful material is also included. This may differ with each module. The type of questions used for the <strong>test</strong> are sometimes also on the CD and can be reached through the Course Menu. Other material such as down-loaded websites are only reached by browsing the CD in the normal way using <strong>Windows Explorer</strong> or browsing from<strong> My Computer</strong>.</p>
    <p>The CD will also provide a lot of additional help to learners with computers (at home or at work).</p>
    <h5>Useful Resources from the Web</h5>
    <p>Each course and its modules are offered to you using advanced e-learning technologies. These have now become available to us through the advancements made in multimedia, software and the general availability of the Internet. </p>
    <p>We have made a study of what may be helpful to you in your learning process. We have selected Web pages, self-assessment tests and free software to be accessible to you. Since you may not have fast Internet access yet, we have down-loaded all you need onto a CD.</p>
    <h3>3. Mentor </h3>
    <p>We help learners to achieve credits by facilitating quality<strong> learning experiences</strong>. We utilize advanced e-learning technology, especially adapted for the individual learner who has contact with a Mentor. </p>
    <h4>An Effective Mentoring System &ndash; Through a Mentor!</h4>
    <h5>DEFINITION OF A MENTOR</h5>
    <p class="crb">An experienced and trusted advisor. An experienced person in an organisation who trains and counsels new employees or students. &ndash; Oxford Dictionary. </p>
    <h5>WHAT IS EXPECTED OF A MENTOR?</h5>
    <p>The Mentor must be available in close proximity to the mentored student who studies for a Certificate or Diploma. Since the teaching model of our Lord Jesus Christ was one of personal contact and spiritual input, we believe that a student who cannot be at a Bible School where interactive sessions are offered, the personal mentor principle is acceptable to provide both <strong>academic support</strong> as well as assisting with <strong>spiritual formation</strong>.</p>
    <p>The student needs someone to give guidance, advice, be a sounding board, and offer wise counsel. Such a person has to have a thorough grasp of the vibrant Church life, which embraces the Biblical way of thinking. The task of the Mentor is further defined in the <strong>Mentor Guide</strong>.</p>
    <h5>Background</h5>
    <p>Calvary Academics prepares, provides and directs <strong>e-learning training material</strong> for the modern needs of the <strong>lifelong learning</strong> generation. <strong>Calvary</strong> offers from the most basic of computer training courses to the most advanced MBA and MBL and the final PhD programmes used in the technology-rich environments of Universities, Colleges and Tuition Centres. The material is provided to adult learners and Tuition Centres that facilitate self-enrichment courses which, through a <strong>mentoring</strong> process, may lead to the granting of <strong>certificates</strong> and <strong>qualifications</strong>.</p>
    <h5>Facilitating</h5>
    <p>Calvary has more than 7,000 students across the country in different Tuition Centres. Your TC is just one of the 250 centres in South Africa alone. We are here to help you if you are interested in a <em><strong>Church Life</strong></em> or <em><strong>Skills Profession</strong></em> programme. We have study modules containing excellent training material. The moment you receive it you will want to start to get all the benefits. Whatever your needs for training are, we can probably help you through the <strong>Calvary Academics</strong> e-learning system. </p>
    <h5>Mentoring Distant Learners</h5>
    <p>We pride ourselves in the fact that we are <strong>tutors</strong>. The Department of Education privately rates us as on the forefront of mentoring in South Africa. That means that we are not like a university or college where you only attend classes. Our students are not limited to the main centres where there are these big institutions. We can be right where you are. Mentors are appointed for certain courses to facilitate learning. The skills courses are written in such a way that you are guided through hard-copy manuals and the pdf's on the resource CD.</p>
    <p>We can reach you by our efficient postal service in immediate (same-day) reaction to your faxed orders when accompanied by your <strong>prepayment</strong> bank-slip. You may have noticed this already.</p>
    <p>The material is accompanied by clear instructions as to how to go about completing each course. See the straight forward instructions in the <strong>Study Letter*</strong>.</p>
    <h3>4. Related Skills </h3>
    <p>The field of <strong>Skills Training</strong> has lately received a new emphasis in modern education which it highly deserves. Skills help people to<strong> do a job</strong>. A skill is the ability or talent to perform a task <strong>well</strong> or <strong>better than average</strong>. If you have the ability to do something well, it was usually gained through <strong>training</strong> or <strong>experience</strong>. <em>Skills Training</em> is an important learning objective.</p>
    <p>A learner can complete most of the skills modules without attending lectures or having need of a lot of help from the Mentor. Some of these studies can therefore take place at home.</p>
    <h5>CQA  Accredited Courses </h5>
    <p><strong>Christian Quality Assurance</strong> (<strong>CQA</strong>) promotes the training most needed for vocations. We have applied and received accreditation for all our <strong>Calvary Academics</strong> (CA) skills courses. </p>
    <p>Accreditation makes a statement about <strong>quality</strong>. It provides a stamp of approval from an authority. Skills training is promoted by several sector authorities because it ensures that workers will perform better and improves their ability and the range of work they can perform. </p>
    <h3>5. Practical Work </h3>
    <p>We believe that the student who studies on the <strong>Calvary Academics Platform</strong> should be developed as a whole person. Man is made in the image of God and has, apart from a body and a soul (the mind, will), also a spirit which is born from above at conversion. We all have a calling which becomes clear at the rebirth and we should train the spirit-man by means of <strong>work of ministry</strong>. As the student is involved in this practical work in God's Kingdom, he or she will become whole.</p>
    <p>The student completes the prescribed Tasks called for in the Practical section: <strong>Work</strong> (in Church context), <strong>Ministry</strong> (in the community), <strong>Mission</strong> (in other area), and Personal work (caring for an individual for some time). This is completed in group context, using the book Calvary Disciple.</p>
    <h3>6. Spiritual Formation </h3>
    <p>Studying through Calvary Academics (at a tuition Centre) is not just about academic excellence. It is also about your life as a Christian. You want to be enriched in your spirit. As Paul says: (1Cor 6:20) "for you are bought with a price. Therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's." Grow in God! Read from page 24 onward how you can enrich your life spiritually. All the modules will also have assignments attached to them such as reading four <strong>Bible chapters</strong>, studying three <strong>Christian virtues</strong> and memorising ten outstanding <strong>Bible verses</strong>.</p>
    <h3>7. Evaluation </h3>
    <p>The Mentor is responsible for the marking of assignments and tasks as required for each module. The evaluations are formative, which means that the student learns through performing of the task or group discussion for which an evaluation mark or %-age is given. </p>
    <h5>Certificates & Qualifications</h5>
    <p>A Student Number is issued to you by the Tuition Centre when you first enrol for a course. Please quote it on all documents. This is the key to comprehensive record keeping and it is your <strong>User Name</strong> for the <strong>Calvary Academics Platform</strong>. You complete each module of the course by writing the <strong>Module Test</strong>(s), manually or on-line. This will provide proof of the fact that you have studied the material. After completing all the prescribed modules in the course, students may request a copy of their transcript with the view on further studies. </p>
    <p>When you complete 80 or 160 credits you will receive a <strong>Certificate in Christian Discipleship</strong> and then the <strong>Advanced Diploma in Ministry</strong>. Keep going!</p>
