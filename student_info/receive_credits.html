    <h1>Credits and Qualifications</h1>
    <h4>What are Credits?</h4>
<p class="crb"><b>Credits are earned units of study at various academic levels for which a student can provide proof to obtain a qualification.</b></p>
<h5>Unit Numbers</h5>
<p>Academic credits give an indication of how much work must be done to complete a qualification. A programme usually lists the courses that make up a complete qualification, indicating the number of credits each course represents. One credit is based on 10 hours of work, whether done in class, for self-study or learning for tests. For instance, a Certificate (level 5) requires 120 credits and a Diploma a further 120 credits, giving it a value of 240 credits. Part time students complete this over three years, taking 80 credits per year (phase) to earn a certificate and two diplomas. </p>
<h5>Different Levels</h5>
<p>There are a number of levels of learning. Masters is level 8, the doctorate is on level 9 and a PhD on level 10. These levels of learning indicate the level of analysis, reflection and evaluation required to evidence your competency and academic achievement. This evidence is presented through a variety of assessment methods such as tests, assignments, and practical objective evaluation. </p>
<h5>Module Credits</h5>
<p>A study Programme, which when completed gives the learner a qualification, consists of a few courses which are often divided into modules.<b> Calvary Academics</b> provides its study material in the form of these modules and clearly indicates how many credits they carry. These modules can also be built into different programmes in flexible ways as determined by each of the  programme requirements of each study field. The <b>Credits</b> therefore provide a sure indication of the progress a student is making towards completing the programme leading to a qualification.</p>
<h4>How do I Earn Credits?</h4>
<h5>Evaluation</h5>
<p>A Tutor, Lecturer, Mentor or a <b>Study Leader</b> (PostGrad Tutor) is responsible for much of the evaluation. Candidates or students are evaluated by participation in group discussion, class participation, through presentations, tests or assignments for the skills modules. The greater the number of credits allocated to the module, the more comprehensive the evaluation will be. </p>
<h5>A Record on the Database</h5>
<p>Upon registration as student with Calvary, an academic student record is opened on the Calvary Academics database in which all the courses and their pass marks are progressively recorded. Students are issued a student number which should be prominently displayed on all correspondence. All the modules which make up the chosen programme must first be recorded on the Calvary Academics Platform before studies can commence. Modules are usually finished by the student in the recommended order, until the programme is completed. </p>
<h5>Transcripts</h5>
<p>A Transcript is an <b>official report</b> detailing the educational work successfully completed by the  student in a school or college. It is a printed reproduction of the student&rsquo;s official record. All the modules (recording their marks and dates completed) for a specific Programme are indicated, showing the total credits earned and the number of credits still needed for the qualification. </p>
<h5>Qualifications</h5>
<p>Qualifications are made up of Courses. Six or more courses often provide enough credits for a 120 credit qualification. Qualifications deal with content suitable for a certain profession or job description. This may be described as a <b>Counsellor</b>, <b>Pastor</b> or <b>Administrator</b>. </p>
<p>The different levels of qualifications in most cases are described as a Certificate, Diploma, Advanced Diploma and Bachelor degree. A <b>Prospectus</b> is the information document that describes the characteristics of each qualification in terms of <b>which courses</b> (and modules) must be taken in order to receive for instance a Diploma in Counselling or a Master of Divinity.</p>
<h4>What Proof do I Get for my Earned Credits?</h4>
<h5>Study Record</h5>
<p>Bearing in mind that a credit is a unit which represents a successfully completed part of an educational programme, the only valuable proof of credits is the document containing a list of <b>completed</b> courses or modules. A course or module is completed when every test or assignment of the course or module is marked and graded. The updated<b> Study Record</b> is therefore the basis of value for the student. The "<b>Transcript</b>" is the proof of what the student has completed.</p>
<h5>Having Qualified</h5>
<p>To qualify means to prove capable that you meet the requirements. For this to be said of you, the<b> whole programme </b>of courses prescribed to you must be completed. Only then can an official record, showing that you have finished a training programme, or that you have the necessary skills,  be issued to you. </p>
<p>Certificates can also be issued for a "<b>short course</b>" (so called cluster of courses) when all the modules of the "short course" have been completed. A <u>short course</u> has less than 120 credits. This is, however, not a qualification, since a qualification has to do with qualifying for a certain profession (i.e. job, career or vocation). Short courses can be combined to form qualifications.</p>
<h5>Academic Profession</h5>
<p>A profession is an occupation, vocation or career such as law, medicine, or engineering, that requires<b> prolonged academic training </b>and a formal qualification in a specific academic field. It is usually applied to occupations that involve <b>specialized knowledge</b> of a subject, field, or science. Professional activity involves <b>systematic knowledge</b> and <b>proficiency</b>. Professions are usually regulated by<b> professional bodies</b> that may set examinations of competence, act as an licensing authority for practitioners, and enforce adherence to an <b>ethical code of practice</b>. </p>
<h5>Skills Profession</h5>
<p>A skills profession is a <b>vocation</b> based on manual or <b>practical activities</b>, traditionally labelled as non-academic and it is totally related to a specific trade, occupation or vocation. Learners are prepared for their vocation through technical education, as the learner directly develops expertise in a particular group of techniques or technology. This is often called Vocational Education and Training (VET) or Career and Technical Education (CTE). It teaches <b>procedural knowledge</b> (how to do something) as contrasted with declarative knowledge. Vocational education can interact with the apprenticeship system and is often performed as in-house training. Although it is of a more practical nature, it has an academic side to it as the learners also must know the theory of their Skills Profession. </p>
