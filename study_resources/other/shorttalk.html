  <h1>The 12 Minute Talk</h1>
<h2>Communicating your research effectively.</h2>
<br />

<h3>Structure</h3>
<p>Organize your talk along the following lines:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tell the audience what your talk is about and where you aim to take them. </li>
<li>Introduce the subject by posing the problem you are to address in the context of what is already known. </li>
<li>Describe your approach and methods minimally -- if you can assume knowledge of the audience, assume it to be already given. This section may be longer if you are presenting a research proposal.</li> 
<li>Present the results, focussing on no more than three key ideas. Bring each idea to closure. This section may be shorter if you are presenting a research proposal. </li>
<li>Discuss the implications of the results for management or the discipline of study. </ol>
<p><b>Some good advice</b>: A noted speaker was asked his secret of success. "First," he said, "you write an exciting opening that will draw the attention of everyone in the room. Then you compose a dramatic summary and closing words that will leave the audience spellbound. Then," he advised, "you put them as close together as possible."</p>

<h3>Criteria for success</h3>
<p>A talk will be considered successful if:</p>
<ol>
<li>the talk does not exceed the allotted time of twelve minutes. </li>
<li>the subject is well introduced with the scope set and the objectives clearly stated. </li>
<li>the talk is focussed on no more than three major points with supporting data and argument.</li> 
<li>there is minimal information provided on materials and methods, unless the talk is methodological or a research proposal.</li>  
<li>the implications for the discipline of study or in application are clearly stated.</li>  
<li>the talk, and each of the sentinent ideas, are brought successfully to closure -- the audience is not left hanging or thinking "so what"? </li> 
<li>textual overheads/slides do not exceed 12 in number. </li> 
<li>overheads/slides are clearly legible from the rear of the room by the most myopic, and are free of unnecessary detail or excessive content. </li> 
<li>the talk is presented in a clear voice, audible from the back of the room and relatively free from, uh, vocal faults. </li> 
<li>the speaker is clearly enthused by his or her topic. </li> 
<li>questions are addressed without evasion and answers demonstrate deep understanding of the research topic and key issues that relate to it.</li> 
</ol>
<p>Errors of logic, though devastating in extreme cases, are not to be considered faults of the presentation. Constructive criticism during or following a talk is to be welcomed. Indeed it should be actively encouraged by exposing the weak points of your research to criticism and suggestion.
