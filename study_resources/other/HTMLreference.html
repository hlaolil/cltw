    <h1>HTML Quick Reference</h1>
    <p>This is a &quot;quick reference&quot; or index to all elements from the upcoming HTML 3.2 reference. All the elements are listed with a brief description and some notes on syntax. </p>
    <h2>General syntax</h2>
    <p> An HTML document consists of text, marked up with <i>elements</i>. An element
      consists of a start <i>tag</i> with optionally a closing tag. If there
      is no closing tag, the element is said to be <i>empty</i>. If there is
      a closing tag, the element is used to mark up its contents in a
      particular way. Note that in some cases, the closing tag may be omitted
      as it can be clear from the context where it ends. </p>
    <p> Elements can have certain <i>attributes</i>, which provide extra
      information about the enclosed text. These attributes are used on
      the opening tags, and may not be repeated or added to the closing tag.
      An attribute consists of a name and (most of the times) a value. This
      value may always be enclosed in quotes (&quot;), but <em>must</em> be enclosed
      in quotes if the value contains more than just letters, digits, hyphens
      and/or periods. </p>
    <p> For example, <code>&lt;A&nbsp;HREF=&quot;foo/bar.html&quot;&gt;foozlebib&lt;/A&gt;</code> is the
      HTML markup to turn the text &quot;foozlebib&quot; into a hyperlink to document
  &quot;foo/bar.html&quot;. The element used here is <a href="x.html">A</a>, with the attribute HREF.
      The value for HREF is quoted, as it contains the character &quot;/&quot;. </p>
    <p> <code>&lt;H1&nbsp;ALIGN=CENTER&gt;Welcome!&lt;/H1&gt;</code> marks up
      the text &quot;Welcome!&quot; as a level one header. The attribute ALIGN here
      indicates the alignment of this header, in this case centered. As
      the value consists only of letters, the quotes may be omitted. </p>
    <p> Tags and attribute names are not case sensitive; attribute values are. </p>
    <h2>Structure of a document</h2>
    <p> An HTML document that adheres to HTML 3.2 begins with a so-called <i>DOCTYPE</i> declaration. This is necessary for <a
href="/links/validators.htm">validators</a> to check the elements you
      used against the ones in the HTML version you use. The DOCTYPE
      declaration for HTML 3.2 looks like this:<br />
    </p>
    <blockquote><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN&quot;&gt;</code>.</blockquote>
    <p> Next comes the HTML opening tag. This top-level element contains
      the head and the body of the document. The head of a document provides
      information about the document, and the body contains the actual
      marked up text. </p>
    <p> An outline of an HTML 3.2 document would be as follows: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 3.2//EN&quot;&gt;
&lt;HTML&gt;
&lt;HEAD&gt;
... information about document
&lt;/HEAD&gt;
&lt;BODY&gt;
... document body
&lt;/BODY&gt;
&lt;/HTML&gt;
    </pre>
    </blockquote>
    <hr />
    <h2>Elements for the <u>HEAD</u> of a document</h2>
    <p> The head section is used to provide information about the document.
      This can be the title of the document, the name of the author, a
      short description, and many other things. </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><a href="x.html">TITLE</a> - Document title </dt>
      <dd>This element gives the document's title, which is commonly used in the
        browser window to identify the document, but also in bookmark files and
        in search results. This is the only required HTML element. You may only
        use text and <a href="x.html">entities</a> inside this element.
        The title should be understandable out of context. </dd>
      <dt><a href="x.html">META</a> - Meta-information </dt>
      <dd>This is an empty element, used to provide some information or labels
        about the document. The information is given with a name and a value.
        The value is given in the CONTENT attribute, and the name can be given
        in the HTTP-EQUIV or the NAME attribute. If the HTTP-EQUIV attribute
        is used instead of NAME, the name/value pair is treated as if it were
        an HTTP response header. Popular ways to use META:
        <ul>
          <li><code>&lt;META NAME=&quot;author&quot; CONTENT=&quot;Your name here&quot;&gt;</code> </li>
          <li><code>&lt;META NAME=&quot;description&quot; CONTENT=&quot;Describe the document&quot;&gt;</code> </li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt><a href="x.html">LINK</a> - Site structure </dt>
      <dd>Not used by many browsers. The LINK element is used to define
        relationships between this and another document. The other document 
        is indicated in the HREF attribute, and the relationship in the REL
        attribute. For a reverse relationship, use REV instead of REL. Popular
        use:
        <ul>
          <li><code>&lt;LINK REV=&quot;made&quot; HREF=&quot;mailto:your@address.here&quot;&gt;</code> </li>
          <li><code>&lt;LINK REL=&quot;stylesheet&quot; HREF=&quot;/somewhere/something.css&quot;&gt;</code> </li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt><a href="x.html">ISINDEX</a> - Primitive search </dt>
      <dd>Used before forms became popular. This tag should be inserted if
        the document can be searched on the server (for example, if the
        document is generated with a CGI script). The message in the search
        window can be specified using the PROMPT attribute. </dd>
      <dt><a href="x.html">BASE</a> - Location of document </dt>
      <dd>When you put a document on a server, you can indicate the actual
        location of the document with the BASE element. The required HREF
        attribute indicates the actual location. All relative URLs in the
        document are resolved against this URL. </dd>
      <dt><a href="x.html">SCRIPT</a> - Inline script </dt>
      <dd>In HTML 3.2, nothing is done with text inside this element. Certain
        browsers support scripts, which should be defined in here. </dd>
      <dt><a href="x.html">STYLE</a> - Style information </dt>
      <dd>In HTML 3.2, nothing is done with text inside this element. Certain
        browsers support stylesheets, and style information can be defined
        inside this element. </dd>
    </dl>
    <hr />
    <h2>Elements for the <a href="x.html">BODY</a> of a document</h2>
    <p> The body of the document contains the actual text, marked up with
      HTML elements. The document colors are specified using attributes
      on the &lt;BODY&gt; tag. These attributes are TEXT (normal text),
      LINK (unvisited links), VLINK (visited links), BGCOLOR (background
      color) and ALINK (selected links). They are given a hexadecimal
      color code, in red-green-blue notation. For example, &quot;#FF0000&quot; is
      bright red. An image to be used as background can be specified using BACKGROUND.
      These are all optional, but if one is used, it is recommended that
      they all are. Otherwise certain selections may conflict with user
      settings and turn some text unreadable. </p>
    <p> The text in a document is mainly marked up using <i>block-level
      elements</i>. Text inside a block-level element is marked up
      using <i>text-level elements</i>. Certain block-level elements may
      also contain other block-level elements, or only a restricted set
      of elements and no text. </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>Headers: <a href="./block/h1.html">H1</a>, <a href="./block/h2.html">H2</a>, <a href="./block/h3.html">H3</a>, <a href="./block/h4.html">H4</a>, <a href="./block/h5.html">H5</a> and <a href="./block/h6.html">H6</a>. </dt>
      <dd> In HTML there are six levels of headers, ranging from level one
        (most important) to six (least important). They
        should be used in hierarchical order. The horizontal alignment for each
        header can be indicated using the ALIGN attribute, which takes values of
        LEFT, RIGHT and CENTER. </dd>
      <dt>Paragraphs: <a href="./block/p.html">P</a>. </dt>
      <dd>Most of the text will be inside paragraphs. These are marked up
        using the <a href="./block/p.html">P</a> element. The horizontal alignment for a paragraph
        can be indicated using the ALIGN attribute, which takes values of
        LEFT, RIGHT and CENTER. The closing tag for paragraphs is optional.
        Note that a paragraph is a <em>container</em> and <strong>not</strong> an empty tag. </dd>
      <dt>Block quotations: <a href="./block/blockquote.html">BLOCKQUOTE</a>. </dt>
      <dd>To indicate a quoted piece of text, use this element.
        It has no attributes, and may contain paragraphs, headers and
        other block-level elements. </dd>
      <dt>Preformatted text: <a href="./block/pre.html">PRE</a> </dt>
      <dd>Text that is already formatted for a specific width (for example
        ASCII art) can be marked up using the <a href="./block/pre.html">PRE</a> element. Unlike
        normally, linebreaks and spaces are rendered as shown. </dd>
      <dt>Address information: <a href="./block/address.html">ADDRESS</a> </dt>
      <dd>The <a href="./block/address.html">ADDRESS</a> element is usually placed at the bottom of the
        document to provide some information to the reader. This can contain
        the URL of the document, the e-mail address of the author, but
        also a normal address. </dd>
      <dt>Divisions: <a href="./block/div.html">DIV</a> </dt>
      <dd>A division (marked up with <a href="./block/div.html">DIV</a>) encloses a number of block-level
        elements. It is used to set the default alignment and to group these
        elements together. It takes the attribute ALIGN with values LEFT,
        RIGHT and CENTER. <br />
        &lt;<a href="./block/center.html">CENTER</a>&gt; is a shorthand for <code>&lt;DIV ALIGN=CENTER&gt;</code>. </dd>
      <dt>Horizontal rules: <a href="./block/hr.html">HR</a> </dt>
      <dd>The <a href="./block/hr.html">HR</a> element (empty) is used to indicate a break in the document,
        usually with a horizontal ruler. The appearance of this ruler can
        be indicated with several attributes. Its width can be set using the
        WIDTH attribute, with a number in pixels or a (quoted) percentage,
        its height in pixels is set using the SIZE attribute, and if the width
        is less than 100%, the alignment can be set with the ALIGN attribute
        (values of LEFT, RIGHT and CENTER). The NOSHADE attribute draws the
        rule without a 'shadow'. </dd>
      <dt>Lists </dt>
      <dd> HTML knows three major types of lists: ordered, unordered and
        &quot;definition&quot; lists. The former two differ only in the labeling of
        each list item; ordered lists are numbered and unordered lists are
        bulleted.</dd>
    </dl>
    <blockquote>
      <p> An unordered list is indicated with <a href="./list/ul.html">UL</a>, with the optional TYPE
        attribute. This attribute can be DISC, SQUARE or CIRCLE, and indicates
        the type of bullet to use. The opening and closing tags are required
        and UL may only contain LI elements and nothing else. </p>
      <p> An ordered list is indicated with <a href="./list/ol.html">OL</a>, with the optional TYPE
        attribute. It can be 1 (decimal), a (lowercase letters), A (uppercase
        letters), i (lowercase Roman) or I (uppercase Roman). The optional
        START attribute indicates the starting value for the list. It musta
        always be given in decimal, regardless of the value in TYPE.
        The opening and closing tags are required
        and OL may only contain LI elements and nothing else. </p>
      <p> Items for both these lists are given with <a href="./list/li.html">LI</a>. A list item may
        contain other block-level elements. </p>
      <p> A definition list is similar to an unordered list, except in that
        it uses two elements per item: <a href="./list/dt.html">DT</a> marks up the term to be
        defined, and <a href="./list/dd.html">DD</a> provides its definition. These are the only two
        elements that may appear inside <a href="./list/dl.html">DL</a>. A definition list typically
        appears without bullets. </p>
    </blockquote>
    <hr />
    <h2>Tables</h2>
    <p> Tables are used to present tabular information.  In HTML, tables
      are constructed as a series of rows. Before the first row, the <a href="./table/caption.html">CAPTION</a> element provides a caption for the table. </p>
    <p> The <a href="./table/table.html">TABLE</a> element takes several attributes: </p>
    <dl compact="compact">
      <dt>BORDER=n </dt>
      <dd>Indicates that a border of n pixels should be drawn around the
        table. If this attribute is omitted, no border is drawn. </dd>
      <dt>ALIGN=left|right|center </dt>
      <dd>Indicates the alignment of the table. In many browsers, ALIGN=CENTER
        is not supported. This requires that the entire table is enclosed
        in a <a href="./block/center.html">CENTER</a> element. </dd>
      <dt>WIDTH=n </dt>
      <dd>Indicates the suggested width of the table, either a pixel value
        or a (quoted) percentage. The percentage is recommended, as values in
        pixels do not take the current window size in account. </dd>
      <dt>CELLSPACING=n </dt>
      <dd>The spacing between table cells, in pixels. </dd>
      <dt>CELLPADDING=n </dt>
      <dd>The amount of space between a table cell border and its contents,
        in pixels. </dd>
    </dl>
    <p> Rows in a table are marked up using <a href="./table/tr.html">TR</a>. The table row can be used
      to set the default alignment for all cells in this row: ALIGN=left|right|center
      for horizontal, and VALIGN=top|middle|bottom|baseline for the vertical alignment.
      This value can be overridden by individual cells. </p>
    <p> There are two types of cells: headers (marked up with <a href="./table/th.html">TH</a>) and
      data cells (marked up with <a href="./table/td.html">TD</a>). They only differ in their
      appearance, the syntax is the same. Both take the same attributes
      as TR, as well as several others: </p>
    <dl>
      <dt>COLSPAN=n </dt>
      <dd>Indicates the amount of columns to the right of the current column
        that this cell overlaps. </dd>
      <dt>ROWSPAN=n </dt>
      <dd>Indicates the amount of rows below the the current row
        that this cell overlaps. </dd>
      <dt>NOWRAP </dt>
      <dd>Disable word wrap in this cell. Line breaks must now be inserted
        manually using <a href="./special/br.html">BR</a>. </dd>
    </dl>
    <hr />
    <h2>Forms</h2>
    <p> With forms, the user can enter data and send it to a program on
      the server. This program can then process the data and send a certain
      request back. The program to process the form, as well as the method
      to send the data to it, are specified using the <a href="./block/form.html">FORM</a> element. The
      ACTION attribute indicates the processing script, and the METHOD
      attribute indicates the method: GET or POST. Forms may not be nested,
      but you can have multiple forms on a document. </p>
    <p> There are three elements relevant to forms. </p>
    <dl>
      <dt><a href="./form/input.html">INPUT</a> </dt>
      <dd>This element is used to create a wide range of input elements.
        It is an empty element, there is no closing tag. In all cases,
        the NAME attribute is used to assign the input a name. Usually
        the initial value can be set using the VALUE attribute.
        <dl>
          <dt>TYPE=text </dt>
          <dd>This generates a input field, where the user can enter up to
            MAXLENGTH characters. The SIZE attribute lists the length of the input
            field (if the user enters more characters, the text will scroll). The
            VALUE attribute specifies the initial value for the input field. </dd>
          <dt>TYPE=password </dt>
          <dd>Same as TYPE=text, but the text will be hidden by &quot;*&quot; or similar
            characters. It is still sent in the clear to the server, though. </dd>
          <dt>TYPE=checkbox </dt>
          <dd>Produces a checkbox. It has two states, on and off. When it is on
            when the form is submitted, it will be sent as &quot;name=on&quot;, otherwise
            it is ignored altogether. If you use CHECKED, it will come up checked
            (selected) initially. </dd>
          <dt>TYPE=radio </dt>
          <dd>Produces a radio button. A radio button always exists in a group.
            All members of this group should have the same NAME attribute, and
            different VALUEs. The VALUE of the selected radio button will be sent
            to the server. You must specify CHECKED on exactly one radio button,
            which then will come up selected initially. </dd>
          <dt>TYPE=submit </dt>
          <dd>Produces a button, which when pressed sends the contents of the
            form to the server. You can have more than one submit button in the form.
            Each should have a different NAME. The name and value of the pressed
            button will be sent to the server as well. The value of the VALUE attribute 
            is typically used as text on the submit button. </dd>
          <dt>TYPE=reset </dt>
          <dd>Also produces a button, which will restore the form to its original
            state if pressed. The value of the VALUE attribute is typically used as 
            text on the reset button. </dd>
          <dt>TYPE=file </dt>
          <dd>Allows the user to upload a file. It is still very new, so it is
            not very widely supported. It is typically presented as an input box
            with a button to start browsing the local hard disk. This way, a user
            can specify one or more filename(s) to upload. </dd>
          <dt>TYPE=hidden </dt>
          <dd>Allows you to embed information in the form which you do not want
            changed. This can be useful if the document is generated by a script
            and you need to store state information. NAME and VALUE of this input
            field will be sent to the server without modifications. </dd>
          <dt>TYPE=image </dt>
          <dd>Functions similar to a submit button, but uses an image instead.
            The ALIGN attribute controls the alignment of the image. The coordinates
            of the selected region will also be sent to the server, in the form
            of &quot;NAME.x=<code>n</code>&amp;NAME.y=<code>n</code>&quot;. A text browser will treat it as
            identical to a normal submit button. </dd>
        </dl>
      </dd>
      <dt><a href="./form/select.html">SELECT</a> </dt>
      <dd>This defines a selection list, with various options. A list of
        options (marked up with <a href="./form/option.html">OPTION</a>) is provided inside the list,
        and one or more of the options can be selected. The SELECT element
        has the attribute NAME, indicating the name for the selected option,
        and the optional attribute MULTIPLE, indicating that multiple elements
        may be selected. The SIZE attribute indicates how many elements should
        be visible at once.
        <p> The OPTION element may only contain text, and has
          the optional attribute VALUE. This is the value returned if this
          option is selected. If none is provided, the text after OPTION is
          used. The SELECT attribute indicates that this option should come
          up pre-selected. </p>
      </dd>
      <dt><a href="./form/textarea.html">TEXTAREA</a> </dt>
      <dd>This element is used to insert a larger input box. The ROWS and
        COLS attributes indicate the number of rows and columns to be used.
        The name to return the entered text in is provided with NAME. A
        default text can be supplied between the opening and closing tags. </dd>
    </dl>
    <hr />
    <h2>Text-level markup</h2>
    <p> Text-level markup can roughly be divided into three groups: physical
      markup, logical markup and &quot;special&quot; markup. The first group contains
      elements that indicate a specific rendering for the enclosed text,
      the second indicate the logical meaning of the enclosed text, and
      the third group indicates some &quot;action&quot;. It is recommended that logical
      elements are used whenever possible, as they adapt better to various
      viewing environments than physical styles. For example, if boldface
      is not available, a different way to render emphasized text can be
      chosen, but only if it is <em>known</em> that this is emphasized text,
      and not to be rendered bold for some other reason. </p>
    <h3>Logical markup</h3>
    <p>None of these elements take any markup. They may be nested and may
      also contain physical or &quot;special&quot; elements. </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="./phrase/em.html">EM</a> - Emphasized text. </li>
      <li><a href="./phrase/strong.html">STRONG</a> - Strongly emphasized text. </li>
      <li><a href="./phrase/dfn.html">DFN</a> - Defining instance of a term, usually the first time it is
        used. </li>

    <h3>Physical markup</h3>
    <p>None of these elements take any markup. They may be nested and may
      also contain logical or &quot;special&quot; elements. </p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="./font/tt.html">TT</a> - Teletype </li>

      <li><a href="./font/sup.html">SUP</a> - Superscript </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>&quot;Special&quot; markup</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="./special/a.html">A</a> - Hypertext anchor. Attributes are HREF (URL to destination)
        and NAME (destination in document). Anchors may not be nested. </li>
      <li><a href="./special/basefont.html">BASEFONT</a> - Default font size. Has a required attribute SIZE
        which ranges from 1 to 7. </li>
      <li><a href="./special/img.html">IMG</a> - Image. The required SRC attribute indicates the location
        of the image (in GIF or JPEG format) to be inserted. The ALIGN attribute
        (values LEFT, RIGHT, TOP, MIDDLE, BASELINE and BOTTOM) indicate the alignment 
        of the text after the image. With LEFT and RIGHT the image is placed
        against that margin, and text flows around it. The WIDTH and HEIGHT
        attributes indicate the width of the image, in pixels. VSPACE and HSPACE
        indicate vertical and horizontal whitespace around the image in pixels.
        The BORDER attribute indicates the thickness of the border around the
        image when it is inside an anchor. The USEMAP and ISMAP attributes are
        used to indicate that the image is an clientside/server-side imagemap.
        See <a href="#usemap">the section on imagemaps</a> for more information.
        Lastly, the ALT attribute must be used to provide an alternative to the
        image if the image is not loaded. </li>
      <li><a href="./special/applet.html">APPLET</a> - Used to insert a Java applet. Parameters are passed
        to it with the <a href="./special/param.html">PARAM</a> element inside APPLET. This element takes
        attributes NAME and VALUE for the parameter to pass. You can put all
        text-level elements inside APPLET. APPLET takes the same attributes
        as IMG, apart from USEMAP, ISMAP and SRC. The location of the applet
        is indicated with CODE instead of SRC. </li>
      <li><a href="./special/font.html">FONT</a> - Font modification. This can be either a font size change,
        indicated with the SIZE attribute (value can be 1 through 7, or a
        (quoted) relative change with +n or -n, make sure the resulting value
        does not exceed 1 to 7), or a font color change, with the COLOR attribute.
        The value of COLOR is a hexadecimal color code, similar to the
        colors specified for the document body. </li>
      <li><a href="./special/br.html">BR</a> - Line break. To ensure that text after a left- or right-
        aligned image does not appear next to it, use the CLEAR attribute to
        scroll down until the indicated margin (LEFT, RIGHT or ALL) is clear. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Client-side imagemaps</h3>
    <p> An imagemap is an image in which &quot;clicking&quot; in various regions leads
      you to different URLs. This is done either with a <i>server-side
        imagemap</i>, which requires that a server examines the location
      chosen and sends back an URL, or with a <i>client-side imagemap</i> where the browser determines the right location itself. An image
      becomes a client-side imagemap if the attribute USEMAP=&quot;location_of_map_data&quot;
      is added. The location must end in #name, where name is the name of
      the <a href="x.html">MAP</a> element used to provide the data. </p>
    <p> The MAP element is used to provide the imagemap data. It takes one
      attribute, NAME, which is the name of the imagemap. It contains a 
      number of <a href="x.html">AREA</a> elements, which each define one area in the map. </p>
    <p> An area comes in four different shapes, indicated with the SHAPE
      attribute. The shapes are RECT (rectangle), CIRCLE (circle), POLY
      (polygon) and DEFAULT (covers non-specified regions). The coordinates
      of a shape other than DEFAULT is defined in the COORDS attribute. This
      attribute takes a comma-separated list of numbers, which make up coordinates.
      For a rectangle, it is &quot;x1,y1,x2,y2&quot;, for a circle it is &quot;x1,y1,radius&quot;
      and for a polygon it is &quot;x1,y1,x2,y2,x3,y3,...&quot;. The URL associated
      with this area is indicated with the HREF attribute. You can also use
      NOHREF instead of HREF, to indicate that this area leads nowhere. You
      must supply alternative text in the ALT attribute, which is used to build
      a list of the areas in a menu.</p>

    <h2>HTML comments</h2>
    <p> HTML <u>comments</u> are provided in a somewhat awkward fashion. The
      exact syntax is rather complex. In short, use the following rule
      to embed comments:</p>
    <dl>
      <dd>An HTML comment begins with &quot;<code>&lt;!--</code>&quot;, ends with
        &quot;<code>--&gt;</code>&quot; and does not contain &quot;<code>--</code>&quot; or 
        &quot;<code>&gt;</code>&quot; anywhere in the comment.</dd>
    </dl>
