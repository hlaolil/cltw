    <h4>Research Approaches</h4>
    <blockquote>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>There are five basic types of educational research
        used today. The following provides a brief summary of these
        methodologies.</p>
      <h2>Qualitative Research</h2>
      <p>Sometimes called ethnographic research. It
        involves collection of narrative data in a natural setting in order
        to gain insights into phenomena of interest. This research studies
        many variables over an extensive period of time in order to find out
        the way things are, how and why they came to be that way, and what it
        all means. Qualitative researchers do not want to intervene or
        control anything. The most common method of data collection involves
        participant observation.</p>
      <h2>Descriptive Research</h2>
      <p>Descriptive research tells &quot;what is.&quot; No
        manipulations of variables are attempted, only descriptions of
        variables and their relationships as they naturally occur.
        Descriptive research answers questions like &quot;what do entry level bank
        tellers know about customer satisfaction?&quot; As with causal-comparative
        studies, there is no control of variables as in experimental
        research. Descriptive research methods range from the survey, which
        describes the status quo of variables, to the correlational study,
        which investigates the relationship between variables.</p>
      <h2>Correlational Research</h2>
      <p>Correlational research determines the whether, and
        to what degree, a relationship exists between two or more
        quantifiable variables. You collect data on at least two variables
        for the same group of subjects and then calculate a correlation
        coefficient between the variables. This correlation coefficient
        (indicated as r ) may have a value between 0.00 to 1.00. A value of
        0.00 would indicate no correlation, while a value of 1.00 would
        represent perfect correlation between variables. Use caution in
        trying to conclude that correlation means causation; there may be a
        third factor which &Ograve;causes&Oacute; both of the related values.</p>
      <h2>Causal-comparative Research</h2>
      <p>Causal-comparative research is used when you
        cannot test a hypothesis by manipulating a variable. This type of
        research allows you to investigate relationships in which variables
        like intelligence, creativity, socioeconomic status, and instructor
        personality cannot be manipulated. For example, suppose you wanted to
        test the hypothesis that students from lower socioeconomic groups
        benefit more from on-line virtual libraries as compared to those in
        higher socioeconomic groups; because you can not assign students to a
        particular socioeconomic group you would use causal-comparative
        research methods.</p>
      <h2>Experimental Research</h2>
      <p>In its simplest form it has three characteristics:
        an independent variable is manipulated, other variables except the
        independent variable are held constant (the idea of experimental
        control), and effect of the manipulation of the independent variable
        on the dependent variable is observed.</p>
      <p>You can think of the independent variable as the
        cause and the dependent variable as the effect. We hypothesize that
        the value of the dependent variable depends upon, and varies with the
        value of the independent variable.</p>
      <p>For example, to examine the effect of different
        font size on reading speed, you might randomly select 30 people and
        time how long it takes to read a passage of text in 10 point font
        size, while another group of 30 reads the same passage in 12 point
        font. You manipulated font size, the independent variable, and
        measured the effect upon reading speed, the dependent
        variable.</p>
      <p>The essence of experimentation is control.<br />

    <h4>Selecting the right topic</h4>
    <h2>Important first step: Selecting the right topic</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Relate the topic to your professional goals. </li>
      <li>An educational phenomena you may wish to
        explain </li>
      <li>An educational problem to which you may look
        for a solution</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The difference between a trivial and significant
      project is not the amount of work required, but the amount of thought
      that is applied in selection and definition of the
      problem.</p>
    <p>Examples? </p>
    <h4>Sources of topics </h4>
    <h2> Your research topic &mdash; from a variety of areas: </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Educational theories that can be validated or
        expanded (educational psychology and educational technology) </li>
      <li>Personal experiences; &quot;What would happen if
        ...&quot;, &quot;What causes ...&quot;, &quot;Why does that happen when we
        ...&quot;</li>
      <li>Literature describing the &quot;next step&quot; </li>
      <li>Replications in which you expand or alter the
        direction of the initial researcher</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Here is a list of relevant <a href="journals.html">journals</a> in the field of educational technology. </p>
    <p>You can also get ideas from Internet listserv
      discussions at <a href="http://www.lsoft.com/lists/listref.html">http://www.lsoft.com/lists/listref.html</a></p>
    <h4>Characteristics of a good topic</h4>
    <h2>The topic needs to be small and manageable</h2>
    <H3>
Look for a topic that contains the following parameters
</H3>
<ul>
  <li>Is it &quot;researchable&quot;? (investigated through
    the collection and analysis of data) </li>
  <li>Is there &quot;significance&quot;? (would it lend
    information to the field of education?) </li>
  <li>Is it &quot;good for you&quot;?
    <ul>
      <li>do you have the interest? </li>
      <li>are the resources available? </li>
      <li>will you have the time? </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Statement of the problem</h4>
<h2>Now you must generate your problem statement.</h2>
<p>The statement should include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>The variables you will be examining </li>
  <li>The relationships between the variables </li>
  <li>The subjects involved </li>
</ul>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The topic to be investigated in this study is
    elementary grade students and their knowledge gains from using
    graphic organizers<br />
  </li>
  <li>The purpose of the study is to identify if
    sixth grade science students do as well on academic achievement
    tests after completing the creation of a concept map as when they
    conduct a hands-on laboratory experiment on the same topic.<br />
  </li>
  <li>Do high school students who are prompted to
    set academic goals achieve higher achievement than those with no
    established goals?<br />
  </li>
  <li>The problem to be studied is the effect of
    collaborative teaming on achievement scores for distance students
    completing courses at San Diego State University.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
  Some hints during the writing: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Write in clear, nontechnical language,
    avoiding jargon. </li>
  <li>Stimulate reader's interests </li>
  <li>Limit in scope to be a manageable problem </li>
  <li>Fit within the context of current theory and
    relevant research </li>
  <li>Should set up the hypothesis that
    follows.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Conducting the literature review</h4>
<h2>Analysis of Documents</h2>
<p>The review involves the systematic identification, location, and
  analysis of documents containing information related to the research
  problem. Its purposes are to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>determine what has already been done that
    relates to your problem. </li>
  <li>identify relevant strategies, procedures, and
    instruments </li>
  <li>facilitate interpretation of your results </li>
</ul>
<h3>Hints</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Secondary sources are more limited in use than
    primary sources, but serve as a good starting point.</li>
  <li>When looking up articles, start with most
    recent first.</li>
  <li>Keep records in which you include an:
    <ul>
      <li>Abstract, </li>
      <li>Bibliographical reference, </li>
      <li>Code, </li>
      <li>Reflections, </li>
      <li>Direct quotes. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A small, well-organized review is better than
    a long verbose review</li>
</ul>
<h4>University Library</h4>
<p>Familiarize yourself with <a href="Boolean.html">Boolean Logic</a></p>
<h4>Generating a good hypothesis</h4>
<p class="example">Definition: A hypothesis is a tentative explanation for certain
  behaviors, phenomena, or events that occurred or will occur. An
  &quot;Educated Guess&quot;</p>
<p>Example: </p>
<blockquote>Your car won't start: What do you do?
  This is generating a hypothesis. Finding why a first grader won't
  learn is much harder, but similar.</blockquote>
<p>Procedure: </p>
<ul>
  <li>reread all notes (it should logically flow
    from review) </li>
  <li>make an outline of your findings </li>
  <li>use deductive logic to progress from general
    material to specific </li>
  <li>end with hypothesis. </li>
</ul>
<p>Consistent with previous research, a reasonable
  explanation for certain behaviors, states clearly and concisely the
  expected relationship, and must be testable.</p>
<h4>Criteria for good hypotheses
</h4>
<h2>A good hypothesis should:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>state an expected relationship between two or
    more variables, </li>
  <li>be worthy of testing, </li>
  <li>be testable, </li>
  <li>be as brief as possible, consistent with
    clarity. </li>
</ul>
<p>Types of hypotheses: </p>
<ul>
  <li>non directional (simply that a relationship
    exists) </li>
  <li>directional (indicates the nature of the
    relationship) </li>
  <li>null hypothesis states no change (for
    statistical reasons) </li>
</ul>
<p>Practice your hypothesis knowledge. </p>
