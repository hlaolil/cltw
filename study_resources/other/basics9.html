    <h1>Be Concise </h1>
    <p class="p8" id="lblu">A series of articles on the basics of <b>Academic Writing</b> </p>
    <h3>Say only the minimum &mdash; not more, rather less.</h3>
    <p> Concision is intimately connected to clarity. Certainly there are some writers, masters of periphrasis, who can take the long way home without getting lost, but as a practical matter the Nuts and Bolts style &ndash; action-oriented subject-verb constructions that match syntax with logic &ndash; tends to make you a more concise writer. </p>
    <p class="emp" id="ftl"> The most valuable of all talents is that of never using two words when one will do.<br />
      Thomas Jefferson (1743-1826) </p>
    <p> But concision remains a struggle for every writer. Writing being the in-process, on-the-fly activity it is, essays come into being with a great deal of stress and mess. As our ideas swirl around us, and as we struggle to give them order, clarity, and vigor, our words swirl around us, too. It's typical for good writers to produce wordy early drafts, and then work through several stages of revision to find and eliminate all the flab. Richard Lanham, one of my favourite writing gurus, says that writing typically starts out with a high &quot;lard factor,&quot; as he calls it &ndash; the number of words in one's first draft divided by the number of words in one's revision. As a rule of thumb, Lanham says, &quot;think of a lard factor of one-third to one-half as normal and don't stop revising until you've removed it.&quot; </p>
    <p class="emp" id="ftr"> I didn&rsquo;t have time to write a short letter, so I wrote a long one instead <br />
      Mark Twain (1835-1910) </p>
    <p> Mark Twain's flippant comment also suggests that it's not too hard to get words down on paper; the difficulty lies in keeping the right ones.</p>
    <h2 id="wor"> The lure of wordiness</h2>
    <p> So many of us are so used to padding our writing that it's hard even to imagine how to cut the fat. Writing to required page lengths is one of the reasons many writers are good at wordiness. Another reason, as we have seen, is that wordiness can serve as a kind of camouflage to reduce one's visibility. Sometimes, though, wordiness just seems to happen.. Here's an all-too typical example from a corporate technical manual. The passage specifies the protocol for tracking changes in an accounting system: </p>
    <p class="ind" id="bgy"> To ensure that the new system being developed, or the existing system being modified, will provide users with the timely, accurate, and complete information they require to properly perform their functions and responsibilities, it is necessary to assure that the new or modified system will cover all necessary aspects of the present automated or manual systems being replaced. To gain this assurance, it is essential that documentation be made of the entities of the present systems which will be modified or eliminated. </p>
    <p> Revising this isn't easy. For one thing, what information can be dispensed with, and what should be preserved? Is it important, for instance, to note that information should be &quot;timely, accurate, and complete&quot;? Or is this obvious from the context? There's no absolute right answer. It depends on what your own voice is, and what your readers expect. Here's one possible revision that maintains a fairly formal tone: </p>
    <p class="ind" id="bgy"> To ensure that users have all the information needed to do their jobs, the new system must preserve the present system's critical functions. Therefore, all modifications to the present system must be documented. </p>
    <p> Here's a slightly less formal version: </p>
    <p class="ind" id="bgy"> Make sure to document all changes to the current system, so that all original functions can be recovered if necessary. </p>
    <p> And here's yet one more version: </p>
    <p class="ind" id="bgy"> Make sure to document all changes to the current system, so any mistakes can be corrected. </p>
    <p> Any of the revisions reads much better than the bloated original. </p>
    <p> <b>Remember</b>: Concision is a constant battle. The keys are to build around strong verbs, prefer the active voice to the passive voice, be suspicious of adverbs, and toss out empty words and phrases.</p>
    <h2 id="cut"> Making the cut</h2>
    <p class="emp" id="ftl"> Less is more.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert Browning (1812-89) </p>
    <p> There are so many ways to bloviate. Here are a dozen examples of wordy claptrap and how to cut through it. Go fast if you get the idea &ndash; but in my experience students need a lot of help gaining the confidence to be concise, and so that's why I provide so many examples. In each instance see if you can figure out what got reworded, what just got cut, and why: </p>

    <h2 id="adv"> Adverbs</h2>
    <p> After verbs adverbs are the part of speech most often abused in college essays. </p>
    <p class="emp" id="ftr"> Substitute damn every time you&rsquo;re inclined to write very; your editor will delete it and the writing will be just as it should be.<br />
      Mark Twain (1835-1910) </p>
    <p> Students, deploying an inert, noun-heavy writing style, recognize that their verbs are often pitifully weak. Thus they tack on adverbs in hopes of adding intensity or precision. But this often falls flat or even backfires. </p>
    <p> Here are several examples of adverbs that weaken sentences because they add nothing of value: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <table width="460" cellpadding="5" rules="all" id="bgb">
        <tr valign="top" class="dbg" id="cen">
          <td width="55%">ORIGINAL</td>
          <td>REVISION</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Socrates convincingly explains his position to Crito.</td>
          <td>Socrates explains his position to Crito.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Euthyphro continues to further explain his actions.</td>
          <td>Euthyphro continues to explain his actions.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>The play carefully examines the disorder brought by civil war.
            </p></td>
          <td>The play examines the disorder brought by civil war.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Antony plays on the crowd's emotions and successfully obtains their support.</td>
          <td>Antony plays on the crowd's emotions and wins their support.</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </blockquote>
    </p>
    <p> Note that in the last example, getting rid of the adverb leads the writer to choose a stronger verb. </p>
