    <h1>Effective Quoting </h1>
    <p class="p8" id="lblu">A series of articles on the basics of <b>Academic Writing</b> </p>
    <p id="dred"> <b>Support your line of thought with words from other thinkers.</b> </p>
    <p> Quotations are a minefield. There are a thousand ways to go wrong &ndash; putting too much stress on quotations, quoting too much, quoting the wrong passages, blurring the line between your voice and those of the sources you quote, disrupting the flow of your argument, and so on. This section of Nuts and Bolts presents generic advice on how to quote effectively. Read it in tandem with the next sections on specific documentation styles. In this section I have followed MLA documentation style, but the examples could easily be adapted to Chicago or other styles.</p>
    <h2 id="quo"> Quotations and proof</h2>
    <p> Within the world of college essays, quotations rarely &quot;prove&quot; anything. What good quotations usually do is support a particular interpretation. Yet one of the most frequent mistakes college writers make is to say that a particular quotation &quot;proves&quot; some claim. Here are some verbs that persuade better than prove:</p>
    <table width="460" cellpadding="5" rules="all" id="ibgb">
      <tr valign="top">
        <td width="33%">suggests<br />
          implies<br />
          testifies to </td>
        <td width="33%">indicates<br />
          argues (that, for)<br />
          shows </td>
        <td width="33%">demonstrates<br />
          supports<br />
          underscores</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p> Suppose for instance you're writing an essay on women in the workplace, and you find a damning quotation from some CEO: &quot;Women just don't make good bosses, and I don't want them messing up my company.&quot; Here are the wrong and right way to comment on this choice bit after quoting it:</p>
    <table width="460" cellpadding="5" rules="all" id="ibgb">
      <tr valign="top" class="dbg" id="cen">
        <td width="140">ORIGINAL</td>
        <td>REVISION</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>This quotation proves that women encounter rampant discrimination in the workplace.</td>
        <td>Smith's comment suggests how much resistance women still face in the workplace.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </p>
    <p> The original tries to get too much from the quotation. It's just one comment, after all, not data on the workplace at large. Stylistically, notice the change in attribution, from This quotation to Smith's comment, a change in keeping with the Nuts and Bolts principle of attaching actions to real actors).</p>
    <h2 id="acc"> Accuracy</h2>
    <p class="emp" id="ftl"> Verbatim et literatim. (Word for word,<br />
      and letter for letter.) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Latin proverb </p>
    <p> <strong>Rule # 1 for quotations: get the words right</strong>. Before I started teaching I wouldn't have thought I'd need to say this, but a great many students seem to think it's okay to get the gist of a quotation, and not sweat over every apostrophe. That is not in fact okay: like it or not, academics are fanatics about<b> word-for-word accuracy</b>. </p>
    <p> What if the original quoted passage has a mistake in it? Reproduce the misspelled word, and, to notify the reader that this mistake occurred in the original, follow it with the word <b>sic</b> in brackets (it's Latin for <b>thus</b> or <b>so</b>, here signifying &quot;<i>it was like this already</i>&quot;): </p>
    <p> Halder does his argument no credit when he opines, &quot;History shows that men are more intelligent then [sic] women&quot; (34). </p>
    <p> If you need to change anything else in the quotation or add some comment within it, indicate your change or addition by using <b>square brackets</b> [this], not parentheses (not this). </p>
    <hr />
    <p> Sometimes word-for-word accuracy by itself may lead to an unclear quotation. In the following sentence from an original text, to what do the pronouns <b>them</b> and <b>themselves</b> refer? </p>
    <p class="emp"> <b>SOURCE</b><br />
      I do not wish them to have power over men; but over themselves. </p>
    <p id="rt"> Mary Wollstonecraft, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, ed. Miriam Brody [London: Penguin, 1992], 156). </p>
    <p> He says this about <i>women</i>. This is not too hard to figure out, but if you don't explain this, readers will hit these pronouns like unexpected speedbumps. You may use square brackets to insert an explanation: </p>
    <p id="ibg"> Mary Wollstonecraft does not wish to reverse the sexual balance of power, but to move from domination to autonomy: &quot;I do not wish them [women] to have power over men; but over themselves&quot; (156). </p>
    <p> Don't get bracket-happy. Use them sparingly. A better general technique for explaining terms in quotations is to introduce them or explain them after the fact, depending on how your argument unfolds and what will work best for the reader, in your judgment (for more on this see Integrating quotations below): </p>
    <p id="ibg"> Mary Wollstonecraft wants women to strive for autonomy, not domination: &quot;I do not wish them to have power over men; but over themselves&quot; (156). </p>
    <p> Note that 18th-century usage permitted Wollstonecraft to use a semi-colon where we would require a comma. The quotation does not try to correct this.</p>
    <h2 id="muc"> Quoting too much</h2>
    <p> Quoting too much is one of the commonest mistakes inexperienced writers make, as if they think it's disrespectful to an original text to cut it into small pieces. But there's nothing disrespectful about helping a quote make an emphatic point. Whenever you quote, be aware of what you're looking for, and try to seize upon a sharp and pithy excerpt: </p>
    <p id="ibg"> If the Piazza del Duomo is the spiritual heart of Florence, the Piazza della Signoria is its secular heart; D. H. Lawrence called it &quot;the perfect center of the human world.&quot; </p>
    <p id="rt"> Barbara Grizzuti Harrison, Italian Days (New York: Ticknor &amp; Fields, 1989), 135. </p>
    <p id="ibg"> Marlowe's Machiavelli calls religion a &quot;childish toy.&quot; </p>
    <p> One needn't go as far as Ralph Waldo Emerson's flat-out disdain for quotations, but make sure that your essays don't look like patchwork quilts. </p>
    <p class="emp" id="ftr"> I hate quotations. Tell me what you know.<br />
      Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803-82) </p>
    <p> Be selective in the quotations you use, and be selective in what you quote from them, keeping only the heart of the quotation as much as possible and keeping the rest of the paper in your own voice and words.</p>
    <h2 id="str"> Strong quotations</h2>
    <p> The best way to build a strong argument is to know the kind of argument a particular discipline (or teacher) expects, and to have good material on which to build. It's important to find the best quotations, the ones that really serve your purpose. Students often gather quotations in a desultory fashion, jumping about the text, stopping when they have what they deem a sufficient number, and then forcing these into an essay regardless of how well they really fit. But there's no shortcut to good research. An important part of the process is going through texts with a fine-tooth comb, reading not only for comprehension but for choice phrases. You should expect to end up with many more quotations than you'll actually end up using in your essay. One tip: teachers will often point out many of the best passages, so keeping track in class can prove helpful come essay (and exam) time.</p>
    <h2 id="cla"> The problem of clarity</h2>
    <p> When you use quotations, you're letting someone else speak in the middle of your discourse. That has its uses, of course, but it also risks confusing your reader about who's speaking and what relation the quoted words have to your own argument. Student writers are often oblivious to this risk because they're not used to looking at what they've written from a reader's point of view. But consider the problems your reader faces. He encounters quotations used for many different purposes: to support or amplify an argument, to raise a new point, to present a point of disagreement. Don't assume your reader will know why you're using a particular quotation. </p>
    <p class="sub"> There are two main problems of clarity in using quotations: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Distinguishing your own argument from the arguments of various quoted passages; and </li>
      <li>making sure the reader understands what a quotation is expected to accomplish.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p class="sub" id="lhn"> 1. Distinguishing your own argument from the argument of a quotation </p>
    <p> Often you'll wish to use quotations to summarize positions with which you'll disagree a little or a lot. This is especially likely to happen when you're surveying past studies or perspectives as a way of laying the groundwork for your own argument. Here's how one prominent literary critic, Stephen Greenblatt, deals with previous approaches to Shakespeare's plays: </p>
    <p id="ibg"> Those plays have been described with impeccable intelligence as deeply conservative and with equally impeccable intelligence as deeply radical. Shakespeare, in Northrop Frye's words, is &quot;a born courtier,&quot; the dramatist who organizes his representation of English history around the hegemonic mysticism of the Tudor myth; Shakespeare is also a relentless demystifier, an interrogator of ideology, &quot;the only dramatist,&quot; as Franco Moretti puts it, &quot;who rises to the level of Machiavelli in elaborating all the consequences of the separation of political praxis from moral evaluation.&quot; The conflict glimpsed here could be investigated, on a performance-by-performance basis ... </p>
    <p id="rt"> Stephen Greenblatt, Shakespearean Negotiations: The Circulation of Social Energy in Renaissance England (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1988), 23. </p>
    <p> Greenblatt wishes to call attention to the &quot;conflict,&quot; as he calls it, between these two views of Shakespeare (conservative or radical). He's not trying to argue that one or the other view is right, and so he crafts the passage to give each view equal weight. In the larger essay from which this excerpt is taken, Greenblatt develops his own perspective, an interpretive model that stresses &quot;negotiation&quot; and ambivalence rather than imposed and settled meaning. </p>
    <hr />
    <p> Sometimes one will want to use a controversial source. The best tack is to set up the quotation in such a way that you show understanding of the controversy:</p>
    <table width="460" cellpadding="5" rules="all" id="ibgb">
      <tr valign="top" class="dbg" id="cen">
        <td width="140">ORIGINAL</td>
        <td>REVISION</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Many Germans participated in genocide: &quot;an enormous number of ordinary, representative Germans became &ndash; and most of their fellow Germans were fit to be &ndash; Hitler's willing executioners&quot; (Goldhagen 454).</td>
        <td>Scholars have long debated what degree of responsibility ordinary Germans bore for the Holocaust. For Daniel Goldhagen the answer is clear: &quot;an enormous number of ordinary, representative Germans became &ndash; and most of their fellow Germans were fit to be &ndash; Hitler's willing executioners&quot; (454).</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </p>
    <p> The original presents Goldhagen's words without any cognizance of the controversy surrounding his argument. The revision, by contrast, takes note of the controversy. It may now go on to agree or disagree with Goldhagen, or take a more nuanced view. The key point is that it's created space for the writer's own view, rather than crowding that view and the quotation's perspective together. </p>
    <hr />
    <p class="sub"> 2. Explaining the point or sense of a quotation </p>
    <p> The other main problem of clarity that arises with quotations is to explain a quoted passage's point. This is especially important when the original text is ironic or carries some other non-obvious meaning. For example, the original passage below presents a quotation from Shakespeare's great villain, Iago, without doing anything to note its irony:</p>
    <table width="460" cellpadding="5" rules="all" id="ibgb">
      <tr valign="top" class="dbg" id="cen">
        <td width="140">ORIGINAL</td>
        <td>REVISION</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Iago says to Othello, &quot;Who steals my purse steals trash; ... / ... / But he that filches from me my good name / Robs me of that which not enriches him / And makes me poor indeed&quot; (3.3.157-61).</td>
        <td>Drawing Othello further into his web, Iago suggests that public embarrassment would be intolerable: &quot;Who steals my purse steals trash; ... / ... / But he that filches from me my good name / Robs me of that which not enriches him / And makes me poor indeed&quot; (3.3.157-61). Iago, of course, is utterly contradicting his earlier declamation to Cassio on the folly of reputation (2.3.256-61).</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </p>
    <p> The revision does a much better job of helping the reader make sense of the quotation, its place in Shakespeare's play, and its function in the essay's argument.</p>
    <h2 id="int"> Integrating quotations</h2>
    <p> Quotations need to be worked into texts, but some efforts to do this actually stop essays dead in their tracks. Here a student thinks she must officially begin the quotation with a clause like He states:</p>
    <table width="460" cellpadding="5" rules="all" id="ibgb">
      <tr valign="top" class="dbg" id="cen">
        <td width="140">ORIGINAL</td>
        <td>REVISION</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>The tension builds when Brutus accuses Cassius of accepting bribes. He states, &quot;Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself / Are much condemned to have an itching palm, / To sell and mart your offices for gold ...&quot; (4.3.9-11).</td>
        <td>The tension builds when Brutus accuses Cassius of accepting bribes: &quot;Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself / Are much condemned to have an itching palm, / To sell and mart your offices for gold ...&quot; (4.3.9-11).</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </p>
    <p> Deleting <i>He states</i> allows a stronger and livelier bridge to the quotation. </p>
    <p> In similar fashion, students often feel they must announce that a quotation or paraphrase serves as an example. But such careful announcements (along the lines of <i>you've just read an example of what I'm talking about</i>) can drag an essay down:</p>
    <table width="460" cellpadding="5" rules="all" id="ibgb">
      <tr valign="top" class="dbg" id="cen">
        <td width="140">ORIGINAL</td>
        <td>REVISION</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>The Duke, disguised as a friar, gets a woman named Mariana to take Isabel's place. This is one example of how the Duke plans just as a director would do.</td>
        <td>The Duke, disguised as a friar, gets Mariana to take Isabel's place. Here the Duke acts like a skilled director.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </p>
    <p> The revision sweeps the original's slow phrasing (<i>This is one example of how</i>) into one word, <i>Here</i>. And notice that in the revision the writer came up with a sharper verb and tighter phrasing. </p>
    <hr />
    <p> As you think about integrating quotations, keep looking for ways to be more concise and lively:</p>
    <table width="460" cellpadding="5" rules="all" id="ibgb">
      <tr valign="top" class="dbg" id="cen">
        <td width="140">ORIGINAL</td>
        <td>REVISION</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>In <i>The Prince</i> Machiavelli states that the general requirement of a prince is to &quot;endeavour to avoid those things which would make him the object of hatred and contempt&quot; (64).</td>
        <td>In <i>The Prince</i> Machiavelli states that a prince should &quot;endeavour to avoid those things which would make him the object of hatred and contempt&quot; (64).</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p> Make sure your quotations fit grammatically into the essay. They can't simply be stuck in anywhere. Like any other elements of writing, quotations must be presented so as to make grammatical sense. Thus a quotations that's an independent clause must not be spliced onto another independent clause:(watch the punctuation)</p>
    <table width="460" cellpadding="5" rules="all" id="ibgb">
      <tr valign="top" class="dbg" id="cen">
        <td width="140">WRONG</td>
        <td>RIGHT</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Hawking is at heart a rational empiricist, &quot;I think there is a universe out there waiting to be investigated and understood&quot; (44).</td>
        <td>Hawking is at heart a rational empiricist: &quot;I think there is a universe out there waiting to be investigated and understood&quot; (44).</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </p>
    <p> In general, introduce a quotation with a colon if the quotation consists of one or more complete sentences and the introductory sentence also stands as a complete sentence. </p>
    <p> If the quotation is not a complete sentence, then you need to weave it into your own sentence as you would any other word, phrase, or clause: </p>
    <p id="ibg"> In medieval Europe love &quot;was not the normal basis of marriage&quot; (Trevelyan 64). </p>
    <hr />
    <p id="ibg"> Fortinbras recasts Hamlet in his own image, as a &quot;soldier&quot; (5.2.385). </p>
    <hr />
    <p id="ibg"> In Chapter 2 of the <i>Second Treatise</i>, Locke defines the state of nature as &quot;a state of perfect freedom ...&quot; (8). </p>
    <p> Let's look more closely at how to introduce quotations.</p>
    <h2 id="duc"> Signal phrases and statements</h2>
    <p> Signal phrases and statements let you introduce quotations with a minimum of fuss but enough information to help the reader make sense of them. Often you'll want to specify the author and text; other times you'll want to provide some other background or context-setting information. No universal rule applies, except to ask yourself what your reader needs to know to understand a quotation and its connection to your argument. </p>
    <p id="ibg"> The Founders understood the new Constitution as &quot;a republican remedy for the diseases most incident to republican government&quot; (Madison 343). </p>
    <hr />
    <p> In Federalist 51 Madison observes, &quot;Different interests necessarily exist in different classes of citizens&quot; (345). </p>
    <p> Students often use weak or vague signal phrases:</p>
    <table width="460" cellpadding="5" rules="all" id="ibgb">
      <tr valign="top" class="dbg" id="cen">
        <td width="140">ORIGINAL</td>
        <td>REVISION</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Another point about sexual difference is made by Rubin. She says, &quot;The human subject ... is always either male or female&quot; (171).</td>
        <td>Rubin questions whether unbiased kinship diagrams are even possible: &quot;The human subject ... is always either male or female&quot; (171).</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </p>
    <p> The original opens with an unhelpful sentence that specifies a topic but not an argument. It follows with the choppy, rhythmless &quot;She says&quot; to introduce the quotation. The revision presents Rubin's argument in a nutshell, and the &quot;even&quot; explicitly ties the sentence back to an ongoing discussion, helping the reader keep the flow in mind. The revision also eschews &quot;She says&quot; in favour of an economical colon that moves speedily to the quotation. </p>
    <hr />
    <p> One common way to build signal phrases is with the According to x construction: </p>
    <p id="ibg"> According to W. C. Jordan, there were about 100,000 Jews in France in the middle of the 11th century (202). </p>
    <hr />
    <p id="ibg"> According to Rich, we need to be careful about the risk of &quot;presentism,&quot; of projecting present meanings on past events (3). </p>
    <hr />
    <p id="ibg"> According to the Polish critic Jan Kott the play is best understood as a &quot;great staircase,&quot; an endless procession of falling and rising kings (10). </p>
    <p> Another technique, and one in keeping with the Nuts and Bolts preference for action-oriented writing, is to use clauses with the cited scholar as subject and a signaling verb to orient the quotation. Indeed, signal phrases (or clauses) are a great place to get strong verbs into academic writing. Here are some variations on the basic signal phrase construction of author + verb (+ that): </p>
    <p id="ibg"> Rich warns us that we need to be careful about the risk of &quot;presentism,&quot; of projecting present meanings on past events (3). </p>
    <hr />
    <p id="ibg"> Patterson reviews the legal limits placed on the murder of slaves (190-93). </p>
    <p> Depending on what you want your reader to know, you can provide all sorts of explanatory material in a signal phrase. Here, for instance, a writer identifies his sources' scholarly expertise in order to make the citation more persuasive: </p>
    <p id="ibg"> The economic historians Nathan Rosenberg and L. E. Birdsell note that in the early capitalist period (from the late fifteenth century on) people had to outgrow firms based on kinship and separate their personal finances from their firm's finances. ... [A long quotation follows] </p>
    <p id="rt"> Francis Fukuyama, Trust: The Social Virtues and the Creation of Prosperity (New York: Free Press, 1995), 154. </p>
    <p> Whether or not you need such explanations depends on your audience; in this case Fukuyama was writing for a general audience that would not be expected to be familiar with the names of the cited scholars. </p>
    <hr />
    <p> One more comment about integrating quotations into an essay: pay attention to rhythm. Here's an in instance in which the writer elegantly integrates a quotation into her own prose. See if you can figure out what she did: </p>
    <p id="ibg"> &quot;Folktales,&quot; Calvino said, &quot;are real.&quot; They catalog potential destinies, the trials of achieving maturity and a full humanity. They are psychologically apt, of course; but Italian folktales also owe a great deal to social realities, to history and to class ... </p>
    <p id="rt"> Harrison, Italian Days, 436. </p>
    <p> First, the writer breaks up the quotation with that inserted signal phrase Calvino said. That separates Calvino's subject, folktales, from the predicate, are real. The effect is to solemnize Calvino's judgment, giving it the rhetorical oomph of truth (this is a highly effective writer's trick). Second, the writer uses the quotation's shortness and simplicity as a springboard to her own more complex sentences and diction. This balancing of long against short, complex against simple, detail against general, is something good writers do all the time &ndash; even with the quotations woven into their texts.</p>
    <h2 id="set"> Set-off quotations</h2>
    <p> In all citation styles, when you wish to include long quotations (more than four lines), you should do so in set-off block format. Left-indent the set-off quotation an appropriate amount (often a half-inch) and prepare for it with a signal statement ending in a colon: </p>
    <p id="ibg"> Steven Katz wryly deconstructs one of the leading figures in the modern Christian tradition: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p id="ibg"> &quot;The Jews&quot; did obsess Luther. They were of immediate, desperate, overwhelming concern. Though as both Oberman and Mark Edwards, following a long tradition of Lutheran scholars, emphasize, no more so than a number of other enemies, for example, the Catholic church, the papacy, and the Turks. ... Luther was a great hater, an ecumenical hater, and Jews had a prominent place on his hate list. (1:388-89)</p>

    <p id="ibg"> Privacy, one observer suggests, is the cardinal virtue of the Dutch: </p>

Never in the line of duty have I been bamboozled as in The Netherlands, where they all tell you different things, no one want to make a full disclosure and they will pick holes in any generalization you care to profess. ...

      <li>Don't put quotation marks around the set-off quotation. </li>

          &quot;A name essentially describes how a company is perceived on the outside. It signals to outside observers what a company stands for; the quality of its products. When the value-priced cosmetics maker Avon tried to improve its reputation by purchasing the prestige retailer Tiffany's in 1979, most doubted the wisdom of the move. That's why it came as no surprise when five years later Avon sold off the operation. Not only did owning Tiffany's fail to add luster to Avon, but negative publicity about Avon ownership was rapidly tarnishing Tiffany's reputation (Fombrum 42).&quot;

    <h2 id="emp"> Emphasis in a quotation</h2>
    <p> When readers see emphasis in a quotation, they don't know whether it was already there or was added by the quoter. Here's how to handle these cases: </p>
    <p id="ibg"> Locke argues that every individual in the state of nature has a right to enforce the laws of nature: &quot;the execution of the law of nature is, in that state, put into every man's hands ...&quot; (9, emphasis in the original). </p>
    <hr />
    <p id="ibg"> For Wollstonecraft, universal education is critical: &quot;my main argument is built on this simple principle, that if she [woman] be not prepared by education to become the companion of man, she will stop the progress of knowledge and virtue; for truth must be common to all, or it will be inefficacious with respect to its influence on general practice&quot; (86, emphasis added).</p>
    <h2 id="eli"> Ellipsis</h2>
    <p> Ellipsis is a fancy word meaning leaving out some of the words in a quotation. Students are reluctant to do this, and of course you don't want to change the sense of a passage by leaving out crucial words. But as I've suggested already, pruning a quotation is one of the best ways of strengthening a quotation's impact. Be careful, however: you must notify the reader of any changes, and naturally you cannot change the meaning of a passage in any material sense. If you leave out words within a quoted sentence, use ellipsis &ndash; three or four dots with spaces between and around them. </p>
    <hr />
    <p> <b>3-dot ellipsis</b> </p>
    <p> When you cut some of the words at the beginning of or within a quotation (but less than a full sentence), use 3-dot ellipsis. </p>
    <p id="ibg"> &quot;Most of the world's Muslims today ... are not Arabs and cannot read Arabic&quot; (Lippman 58). </p>
    <p> Note that you put single spaces around the dots. A considerable number of academic readers care about such things, so be warned. </p>
    <hr />
    <p> <b>4-dot ellipsis</b> </p>
    <p> If the deleted portion of the quotation includes a sentence's terminal punctuation (the punctuation at the end of a sentence), or if you are using the quotation to end a sentence in your essay, then you have to add a fourth dot, representing the period. If you leave out a sentence or more from a quoted passage, you must also use four-dot ellipsis. Make sure that what you do quote consists of grammatically complete sentences before and after the ellipsis: </p>
    <p id="ibg"> Frederick Douglass bores into his listeners' hearts, insisting that no one can truly believe in the justice of slavery: &quot;There is not a man beneath the canopy of heaven, that does not know that slavery is wrong for him. ... At a time like this, scorching irony, not convincing argument, is needed&quot; (Douglass 34). </p>
    <hr />
    <p id="ibg"> Ann Hall perceives the difficulty in evaluating O'Neill's Anna Christie: &quot;For feminist scholars, the conclusion for Anna is ambivalent at best. On the one hand, she is domesticated; she has relinquished all her ambition, and now stands behind 'her man' in order that he may attain his dreams. ... On the other hand, Anna gains a certain degree of independence, ironically through her relationship with Andersen (174).&quot; </p>
    <p> Citations go at the end of the quotation, of course, and are inserted before the final dot of 4-dot ellipsis (except for set-off quotations &ndash; see above). </p>
    <p> Just to complicate things, for set-off quotations the parenthetical is placed after the final dot, the full stop. </p>
    <hr />
    <p> Finally, you don't always need to use ellipsis when you delete words. The reason for ellipsis is to notify your reader that there are words missing from the quotation. If this is already obvious from context, you don't need ellipsis:</p>

    <h2 id="pun"> Punctuating quotations</h2>
    <p> Students get confused about punctuating quotations. For in-text quotations, the rules of American usage are fairly simple: commas and periods go inside the quotation marks (by convention rather than for any rational reason), and all other punctuation marks go outside. If, however, these other punctuation marks are part of the original quotation, then you put them inside the quotation marks. </p>
    <p> If, as is usually the case, a parenthetical citation follows the quotation, it generally goes inside the terminal punctuation. Here's an original passage and various possibilities in quoting from it: </p>
    <p class="emp"><b>SOURCE</b><br />
      At this point I cannot suppress a sigh and a last hope. What is it that I especially find utterly unendurable? That I cannot cope with, that makes me choke and faint? Bad air! Bad air! The approach of some ill-constituted thing; that I have to smell the entrails of some ill-constituted soul! <br />
  <br />
      How much one is able to endure: distress, want, bad weather, sickness, toil, solitude. Fundamentally one can cope with everything else, born as one is to a subterranean life of struggle ... </p>
    <p id="rt"> Friedrich Nietzsche, On the Genealogy of Morals. Trans. Walter Kaufmann and <br />

      ed. David Wootton (Indianapolis: Hackett, 1996), 917. </p>
    <p> Various quoted versions showing different punctuation: </p>
    <p class="p8" id="ibgy"> Nietzsche's melancholic energy is unmistakable: &quot;At this point I cannot suppress a sigh and a last hope. What is it that I especially find utterly unendurable? That I cannot cope with, that makes me choke and faint? <br />
      Bad air! Bad air!&quot; (917) </p>
    <hr />
    <p class="p9" id="ibgb"> &quot;I cannot suppress,&quot; Nietzsche says, &quot;a sigh and a last hope&quot; (917). </p>
    <hr />
    <p class="p9" id="ibgy"> Nietzsche finds some consolation in the sheer catalog of human suffering: &quot;How much one is able to endure: distress, want, bad weather, sickness, toil, solitude. Fundamentally one can cope with everything else ...&quot; (917). </p>
    <hr />
    <p class="p9" id="ibgb"> &quot;What is it,&quot; Nietzsche asks, &quot;that I especially find utterly unendurable?&quot; (917) </p>
    <hr />
    <p class="p9" id="ibgy"> What did Nietzsche mean when he complained about &quot;bad air&quot; (917)? </p>
    <hr />
    <p class="p9" id="ibgb"> Nietzsche envisioned the human condition as &quot;a subterranean life of struggle&quot; (917); his own difficult life bears testimony to this description.</p>
    <h2 id="qwq"> Quotations within quotations</h2>
    <p> Sometimes you will quote a passage that itself contains quotation marks. </p>
    <p class="emp"><b>SOURCE</b><br />
      But though I was initially disappointed at being categorized as an extremist, as I continued to think about the matter I gradually gained a measure of satisfaction from the label. Was not Jesus an extremist for love: &quot;Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.&quot; Was not Amos an extremist for justice: &quot;Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.&quot; </p>
    <p id="rt"> Martin Luther King, Jr., &quot;Letter from Birmingham Jail.&quot; 1963. What Country Have I? <br />
      Political Writings by Black Americans, ed. Herbert J. Storing <br />
      (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1970), 125-26. </p>
    <p> How you handle this depends on whether the main quotation is long enough to be set off or not. If it is a short passage that you are incorporating into your text, then, then you will surround the main quotation with double quotation marks and mark the inner quotation with single quotation marks: </p>
    <p id="ibg"> Instead of denying the accusation that he is an extremist, King embraces it: &quot;As I continued to think about the matter I gradually gained a measure of satisfaction from the label. Was not Jesus an extremist for love: 'Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you ...' &quot; (125-6). </p>
    <p> If it's a set-off quotation, then put the usual double-quotation marks around the inner quotation (since quotation marks aren't put around set-off quotations). </p>
