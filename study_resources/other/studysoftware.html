          <h1>9 Essential Free Programs Every College Student Must Have</h1>
          <p>By <a title="Nate Desmond" href="http://www.debtfreescholar.com/author/admin/">Nate Desmond</a> on <abbr title="Wednesday, April 15th, 2009, 6:32 am">April 15, 2009</abbr></p>
          <div>
            <p>One of the largest computer-related expenses is that of software.  Owners of   new computers often spend hundreds of dollars on their computer&rsquo;s operating   system, office suite, email program, calendar, and other programs.  This does   not need to be.  Here are nine programs that you can use to outfit your   computer&thinsp;&ndash;&thinsp;<em>for free</em>!</p>
            <h3><a href="http://www.openoffice.org/" jquery1312722420453="2">OpenOffice.org</a></h3>
            <p><img title="OpenOffice.org" alt="OpenOffice.org" src="../../images/content/openofficeorg.png" width="300" height="209" /><br />
            OpenOffice.org is a basic office suite.  In many ways,   it is similar to Microsoft Office.  In fact, you can even edit and create   documents in the Microsoft Office format!  This feature is especially useful if   you need to submit college assignments in Microsoft Office format.  In addition,   you can easily create and edit PDF documents in OpenOffice.org.  From what I   have seen, it looks like Microsoft offers a plugin to add PDF capability, but   Open Office comes with this ability by default.  Finally, the best reason to get   Open Office is the price&thinsp;&ndash;&thinsp;free.  No purchase price, no yearly upgrade fee.  I   have used both Microsoft Office and Open Office, and, although I like Microsoft   Office&rsquo;s layout best, the price makes Open Office my first choice.  Why not save   $100 or more?</p>
            <p>Download Open Office <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/" jquery1312722420453="3">here</a>.</p>
            <p>Or, you could buy Microsoft Office <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/" jquery1312722420453="4">here</a>.</p>
            <h3><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator" jquery1312722420453="5">PDF Creator</a></h3>
            <p><img src="../../images/content/pdfcreator.jpg" width="300" height="271" /></p>
            <p>PDF Creator is a user-friendly program with a simple purpose&thinsp;&ndash;&thinsp;create PDFs!    The main advantage of this program is it&rsquo;s simplicity.  Once you download the   software, it acts like a printer.  Go to the print menu on any (or at least   almost any) word processor and &ldquo;PDF Creator&rdquo; will be listed as a printer.  When   you &ldquo;print&rdquo; to it, the program will ask you few optional questions such as the   title, author, and keywords.  Click save, and your document is modified into a   PDF document!  In addition, you can choose to change more advanced options such   as the encryption level, password protection, and user permissions.  For more   information read <a href="http://www.wvnd.uscourts.gov/CMECF/downloads/PDFCreator0.9.1/How%20to%20Use%20PDF%20Creator.0.9.1.pdf" jquery1312722420453="6">this tutorial</a> explaining how to use PDF Creator.</p>
            <p>Download PDF Creator <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator" jquery1312722420453="7">here</a>.</p>
            <h3><a href="http://tellico-project.org/download" jquery1312722420453="8">Tellico</a></h3>
            <p><img src="../../images/content/tellico.png" width="300" height="204" /></p>
            <p>This program is a bibliography/collection manager.  You can use it to manage   your bibliography for school.  Using this program, you can easily archive all   the bibliography information for all your books so that it is all at your   fingertips&hellip;even after you return a book to the library.  You can also use this   software to manage your reading list.  I have spent a long time trying to find a   free program that would manage my reading list.  After a lot of online   searching, I gave up and decided that such a thing did not exist.  However,   while researching for this article, I found Tellico.  This program is perfect   for managing reading lists.  In fact, you can even rate your favorite books   using a star system!  This program also has an <a href="http://periapsis.org/tellico/doc/index.html" jquery1312722420453="9">information packet</a> on what Tellico is and how to use   it.  [Update: I was <a href="http://www.periapsis.org/archives/2009/04/16/another_mention_for_tellico.html" jquery1312722420453="10">just notified</a> that <em>Tellico does not work on the   Windows platform</em>.  Hope they change that soon...]</p>
            <p>Download Tellico <a href="http://tellico-project.org/download" jquery1312722420453="11">here</a>.</p>
            <h3><a href="http://www.getpaint.net/" jquery1312722420453="12">Paint.NET</a></h3>
            <p><img src="../../images/content/paintnet.jpg" width="300" height="223" /></p>
            <p>Paint.NET is the premier free graphics program.  This program was designed by   college students as a class project.  However, they did such a great job that it   really took off!  It has received favorable reviews in nearly every major online   computer magazine.  In addition, it has received funding from Microsoft.  Many   of it&rsquo;s original designers were subsequently hired by Microsoft.  Paint.NET has   gathered a large, enthusiastic following.  From what I can tell, this program is   Microsoft&rsquo;s &ldquo;Paint&rdquo; on steroids.  If you are new to graphic design, these extra   features will seem overwhelming at first, but, with a little practice, you won&rsquo;t   want to go back to a smaller graphic design program.</p>
            <p>Download Paint.NET <a href="http://www.getpaint.net/" jquery1312722420453="13">here</a>.</p>
            <h3><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird/" jquery1312722420453="14">Sunbird</a></h3>
            <p><img src="../../images/content/sunbird.png" width="300" height="225" /><br />
              Sunbird is a free calendar program created by the   Mozilla, the same company that makes Firefox. I have not used calendars/planners   very much in the past, but, if you do use a calendar, this might be the best   option for you. In addition, you could use Mozilla&rsquo;s Lightning, a calendar that   is integrated with email. Both of these programs are downloads, not web apps. I   prefer downloads because of news that I have heard about web applications and <a href="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2007/07/google_calendar_goofs.html" jquery1312722420453="15">security issues</a>.</p>
            <p>Download Sunbird <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/sunbird/" jquery1312722420453="16">here</a>.</p>
            <p>Download Lightning <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/calendar/lightning/" jquery1312722420453="17">here</a>.</p>
            <h3><a href="http://www.xmind.net/" jquery1312722420453="18">XMind</a></h3>
            <p><img src="../../images/content/xmind.jpg" width="300" height="224" /><br />
              XMind is a free brainstorming and mind mapping   program.  This program can be useful for planning a class project, research   paper, or your to do list.  Simply visit the XMind website, click the &ldquo;Download&rdquo;   button, and follow the easy installation process.</p>
            <p>Download XMind <a href="http://www.xmind.net/" jquery1312722420453="19">here</a>.</p>
            <h3><a href="http://www.avast.com/eng/download-avast-home.html" jquery1312722420453="20">Avast: Home Edition</a></h3>
            <p><img src="../../images/content/avast-home-edition.png" width="300" height="99" /><br />
              If you live on campus, you can probably get a internet   security program, such as Norton, free from you college.  If , however, you live   off-campus or your college does not offer free internet security, you can   download Avast: Home Edition for free. From what I can tell, it looks like this   program includes anti-spyware and anti-virus software but does not include a   firewall or internet controls (such as ad blockers).</p>
            <p>Download Avast: Home Edition <a href="http://www.avast.com/eng/download-avast-home.html" jquery1312722420453="21">here</a>.</p>
            <h3><a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/" jquery1312722420453="22">Firefox</a></h3>
            <h3><img src="../../images/content/firefox.jpg" width="300" height="180" /></h3>
            <p>Firefox is the <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_stats.asp" jquery1312722420453="23">most-used web browser</a>, even more than Internet   Explorer.  Why do so many people use Firefox?  Well, there are many reasons.    First, Firefox comes with many security functions.  For example, it warns you if   you try to visit a known malware site.  In addition, this web browser makes it   easy to clear all your private data&thinsp;&ndash;&thinsp;with one click.  Also included in this   browser is a pop-up blocker.  The second reason people like Firefox is the   add-on database.  Many companies and individuals have created add-ons that will   customize your Firefox browser and make it work better.  For example, you can   download an add-on called <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/1865" jquery1312722420453="24">Adblocker Plus</a> that will block most website&rsquo;s   advertisements.  For a full feature list <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/features/" jquery1312722420453="25">visit the Firefox website</a>.</p>
            <p>Download Firefox <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/" jquery1312722420453="26">here</a>.</p>
            <h3><a href="http://www.mozillamessaging.com/en-US/thunderbird/" jquery1312722420453="27">Thunderbird Email</a></h3>
            <p><img src="../../images/content/mozilla-thunderbird.png" width="300" height="241" /><br />
              Thunderbird is an excellent open-source email program   created by the makers of Firefox.  The three main reasons to use this email   program are the security, customization, and organization.  This program comes   with many security features including junk mail filtering, phishing protection,   and privacy protection.  In addition, the email program is highly customizable.    Like Firefox, Thunderbird email comes with plenty of add-ons, extentions, and   themes.  Finally, this email program is useful for organization.  You can easily   color-code different types of messages and search all archived messages.
