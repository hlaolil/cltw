        &quot;The site contains much of interest to faculty teaching thinking in their courses: articles, workshop handouts, lists of books on teaching thinking (including publishers' URLs and telephone numbers), links to other web sites on teaching thinking, a list of URLs for students writing persuasive arguments, and more.&quot; </li>
      <li><a href="http://www.christianlogic.com/index.html">ChristianLogic.com</a> by Nathianel and Hans Bluedorn<br />
        A website all about logic for Christians, with a home-schooling orientation.&nbsp; In many ways this is a wonderful, delightful site, with lots of interesting material and useful resources.&nbsp; Even as an atheist, I can't help admiring the authors for their efforts, though it seems to me that logic should be used not only to defend one's faith but to subject it to critical scrutiny and to question its fundamental tenets.</li>

      <li><a href="http://www.csicop.org/si/9012/critical-thinking.html">A Field Guide to Critical Thinking</a> by James Lett, in Skeptical Inquirer<br />
        &quot;I give [my students] six simple rules to follow when considering any claim, and then show them how to apply those six rules to the examination of any paranormal claim. The six rules of evidential reasoning are my own distillation and simplification of the scientific method. To make it easier for students to remember these half-dozen guidelines, I've coined an acronym for them: Ignoring the vowels, the letters in the word &quot;FiLCHeRS&quot; stand for the rules of Falsifiability, Logic, Comprehensiveness, Honesty, Replicability, and Sufficiency. Apply these six rules to the evidence offered for any claim, I tell my students, and no one will ever be able to sneak up on you and steal your belief. You'll be filch-proof.&quot; </li>
      <li><a href="http://www.carleton.ca/~tpatters/teaching/climatechange/sciencemethod.html">An Introduction to Science, Scientific Thinking and the Scientific Method</a><br />
        Essay providing an overview of the scientific method and its connection with critical thinking. Intended for science undergraduates, but may be useful in other contexts. </li>

        &quot;the Centroid Caf&eacute; proposes the FAIR Assessment Engine, a stratagem for debunking any bunk that you might encounter.

    <h3>Critically Evaluating Web Pages </h3>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://school.discovery.com/schrockguide/eval.html">Kathy Schrock's Guide for Educators</a><br />
        &quot;With the advent of the World Wide Web and the huge amount of information that is contained there, students need to be able to critically evaluate a Web page for authenticity, applicability, authorship, bias, and usabilty. The ability to critically evaluate information is an important skill in this information age.&quot; </li>
      <li><a href="http://www.tccd.net/libgate/eval.htm">Thinking Critically about World Wide Web Resources</a> by Esther Grassian, UCLA College Library.<br />
        &quot;The World Wide Web has a lot to offer, but not all sources are equally valuable or reliable. Here are some points to consider...&quot; This page is a pretty useful list of points to consider. It can be found at various places around the WWW. </li>

    <h3>Critical Reading and Writing </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="http://www.criticalreading.com/">Dan Kurland's www.criticalreading.com</a><br />
        Everyone complains that students cannot read well and yet most high schools and colleges offer no course in critical reading. This is the website for just such a course. Criticalreading.com shows you how to recognize what a text says, what a text does, and what a text means by analyzing choices of content, language, and structure. It shows you what to look for, and how to think about what you find.&quot; </li>
      <li><a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~compose/faculty/pedagogies/thinking.html">Teaching Critical Thinking Through Writing</a>, Dartmouth College Composition Centre<br />

    </ul>
    <h3>Argument Mapping </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> Argument mapping is producing &quot;boxes and arrows&quot; diagrams of reasoning, especially complex arguments and debates. Argument mapping improves our ability to articulate, comprehend and communicate reasoning, thereby promoting critical thinking. </li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.austhink.org/tutorials/default.htm">Argument Mapping Tutorials</a> from Austhink<br />
        Argument mapping is using graphical methods to display the structure of reasoning and argumentation.&nbsp; The technique is essential for advanced critical thinking.&nbsp; Without mapping, it is very hard to be clear about the structure of evidence; and without such clarity, critical responses usually misfire.&nbsp; These six extensive tutorials cover the fundamentals of argument mapping, from elementary inferences through to the most complex arguments.&nbsp; Each tutorial contains concepts, principles, and vocabulary; a quiz; and exercises with model answers. </li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.macrovu.com/CCTGeneralInfo.html">Can Computers Think?</a>&nbsp;<br />

      <li> <a href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~ctwardy/Papers/reasonpaper.pdf">Argument Maps Improve Critical Thinking</a>, by Charles Twardy.<br />
        &quot;Computer-based argument mapping greatly enhances student critical thinking, more than tripling absolute gains made by other methods. I describe the method and my experience as an outsider. Argument mapping often showed precisely how students were erring (for example: confusing helping premises for separate reasons), making it much easier for them to fix their errors.&quot; </li>
      <li> <a href="http://www.touchstone.com/tr/wp/IBIS.html">The IBIS Manual: A Short Course in IBIS Methodology</a> by Jeff Conklin?<br />
        Short guide to IBIS, a method for helping groups think their way through &quot;wicked&quot; problems (e.g., should the US invade Iraq?). &quot;IBIS (pronounced &quot;eye-bis&quot;) stands for Issue-Based Information System, and was developed by Horst Rittel and colleagues during the early 1970's. IBIS was developed to provide a simple yet formal structure for the discussion and exploration of &quot;wicked&quot; problems. The purpose of this manual is to explain the rules of the IBIS method, to convey a sense of the power, simplicity, and ease of use of the method and, most importantly, to give the reader confidence that he or she can use the IBIS method to sharpen and organize the exploration of virtually any topic.&quot; </li>
    </ul>
