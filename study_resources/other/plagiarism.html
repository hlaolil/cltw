<h1>Prevent Plagiarism</h1>
<p>Lecturers are primarily responsible for teaching students the attitudes, skills and behaviours which will prevent plagiarism. Following is a list of tactics which may assist you.</p>
<h3>Informative</h3> 
<ul>
<li>Discuss the issue of plagiarism regularly with students - at least at the start of each term.</li>
<li>Make sure students understand the main concepts of plagiarism, intellectual property, copyright and fair dealing.</li>
<li>Make them aware of the UP, faculty and departmental policies and regulations - stress the connection between the definition of plagiarism and the policies and regulations.</li>
<li>Warn students about the seriousness of the offence and the consequences of plagiarism for their academic and professional careers. Spell out the penalties which may be incurred.</li>
<li>Make them aware of all available help.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Place copyright and plagiarism warnings prominently in study guides.</li>
<li>Include an anti-plagiarism slide in every Powerpoint presentation used for lecturing.</li>
<li>Refer students to available resources.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Educative</h3> 
<ul>
<li>Be a positive role model: provide proper references to your lecture notes..</li>
<li>Discuss the issue in terms of values: 1) Plagiarism is theft of words and ideas and simply not done by a decent and honest person, 2) Plagiarism violates our values of trust and academic integrity. </li>
<li>Discuss the issue in terms of intellectual property, fair use and the role that referencing (citing) plays in the advancement of science.</li>
<li>Explain the reasons for referencing (citing). </li>
<li>Discuss the benefits of proper citation: it shows you have read about the subject, that your views are tied to that of experts and it helps the reader to locate the sources.</li>
<li>Teach them the skills of academic writing, especially quoting, paraphrasing, summarizing and citating, and make sure they observe it. (good examples available at http://www.english.vt.edu/~IDLE/plagiarism/plagiarism3.html)</li>
<li>&quot;Cyberplagiarism&quot; (plagiarizing the Internet) is a particular problem at the moment: familiarize yourself with the citing of web sources and teach the correct style to your students.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Stress the need for original, critical thinking.</li>
<li>Make sure students are information literate.Contact your information specialist for help in this regard. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Preventative</h3> 
<ul>
<li>Rethink the design and assessment of assignments:&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>reconsider exactly what you want to assess,&nbsp;</li>
<li>make sure everybody understands the assignment,</li>
<li>make it relevant to future employment or research,&nbsp;</li>
<li>integrate different elements of assessment,&nbsp;</li>
<li>beware of broad, general topics,</li>
<li>if possible, use very current topics,</li>
<li>change topics regularly,</li>
<li>be specific about expectations:&nbsp; length, type of sources, currency, style, scope,</li>
<li>provide citation standard and examples,</li>
<li>spell out your interpretation of collaboration,</li>
<li>allow enough time,</li>
<li>check sources in bibliographies randomly,</li>
<li>include some specific required reading for each assignment,</li>
<li>require interaction and feedback by way of oral presentations or written feedback from other students.</li> </ol>
<ul>
 <li>Insist on a declaration of academic integrity to accompany each assignment. </li>   </ul>
<h3>Declaration</h3>
 <p>1. I understand what plagiarism is and I am aware of the University's policy in this regard.</p>
 <p>2.&nbsp;The essay/report/project/assignment/dissertation/thesis ........... is my own work.</p>
 <p>3. Where other people's work has been used (either from a printed source, internet or any other source) this has been carefully acknowledged and referenced in accordance with departmental requirements.</p>
 <p>4. I have not used another student's past work to hand in as my own.</p>
 <p>5. I have not allowed and will not allow, anyone to copy my work with the intention of passing it off as his/her own work.</p>
 
 <p>Signature________________________</p>
	  
<ul>
<li>Deal with detected plagiarism in a fair and consistent manner within the regulations.</li>
<li>Familiarise yourself with the phenomenon of essay banks or paper mills (for an overview see

<li>Let your students know that you have a good grasp of plagiarism issues and have resources available for tracking it down.</li>
<li>Use electronic detection tools.</li>
<li>Do not turn a blind eye because it is painful and time-consuming.</li>
