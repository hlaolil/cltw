    <p class="p8" id="lblu">In order to know how to complete an M- or D-, please see: <b><a href="dissertationstages.html">Dissertation Stages</a></b> </p>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p id="grn"> These notes have been drafted to serve as a quick checklist for researchers going into a new project for a Masters' dissertation or higher level. </p>
    <p id="ind">Research is not an end in itself; it is a means to an end. </p>
    <p>Different institutions may have different approaches.  The researcher should therefore acquaint him- or herself with the requirements of their institution. </p>
    <p class="emp"><b>Integrity</b>: Do not claim more than you can present.  See, for example, the very questionable way in which theologians of movements such as the Jesus Seminar present so-called facts for which they claim scientific validation. </p>
    <h2>Modern research procedure</h2>
    <p>Modern research can be summed up by the following points:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>A research project originates with a <b>problem</b> and </li>
      <li>ends with a conclusion. </li>
      <li>The entire process is built on the observation of facts, called <b>data</b>. </li>
      <li>The research process is <b>logical</b>, </li>
      <li><b>orderly</b>, and </li>
      <li>it is guided by a <b>reasonable guess</b> (the hypothesis). </li>
      <li>The research can confirm or reject the hypothesis on the <b>basis of facts</b> alone, and not on questionable bases such as assumptions. </li>
      <li>Research must arrive at a conclusion <b>only</b> on the basis of what the <b>data</b> dictate. </li>
      <li>The conclusion resolves the problem.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>Characteristics of basic research</h2>
    <p>We list seven characteristics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Subjective</b>: begins in the mind of the researcher, who should demonstrate an ability to look at a situation and see unresolved problems. </li>
      <li>Research requires <b>skills of articulation</b> - to state precisely and unambiguously what the problem is that will be researched. </li>
      <li><b>Proper planning</b>: provide practical and specific ideas on how the research might be conducted. </li>
      <li>Researchers should be aware that the total research problem is often too large an investigative area to be managed as a whole.  Consider from the start the feasibility of dividing into <b>sub problems</b>. </li>
      <li>The researcher will seek direction through an appropriate hypothesis - an intuitive feeling, hunch, supposition, or an educated guess with respect to the outcome of the problem.  These are all tentative, for in the end the facts will determine the outcome.  The facts will either <b>support</b> (the appropriate term to use) the hypothesis or not; there is no middle ground. </li>
      <li><b>Assumptions</b>, which are self-evident truths, provide the foundation upon which the entire research structure rests.  These assumptions must be valid or the research cannot proceed.  For example, if the researcher  distributes a research questionnaire to test Biblical insight, he/she will assume that all respondents have had exposure to Bible teaching as members of a Christian congregation. </li>
      <li>The data for research must be <b>specific</b> and <b>measurable</b>. Research can only arrive at valid conclusions on the basis of specific, hard, verifiable and measurable facts.  The facts must lead to a final meaning.  To this end, data has to be arranged into categories, converted to graphical presentation, and analysed statistically - in other words the data must be interpreted.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Distinguish tools and methods</h3>
    <p>Do not confuse tools with methods.  One does not conduct &quot;library research&quot;; the library is simply the tool. </p>
    <h2>Two broad methodologies</h2>
    </p>
    <h3>Qualitative research</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Can be described as a &quot;warm&quot; approach. </li>
      <li>Qualitative research is largely <b>field focused</b>.  The researcher will, for example, go out to churches, visit home cells, or observe home cell leaders. </li>
      <li>An <b>observation schedule</b> is used to perceive the presence of behaviours and to interpret their significance. </li>
      <li><b>Interpretive character</b>: The qualitative researcher aims to find the meaning beneath manifest behaviour, and tries to account for what they have given an account of. </li>
      <li>Qualitative studies display the use of <b>expressive language</b> in the text. </li>
      <li><b>Criteria for judging the success</b> of qualitative research lies in its coherence, insight and instrumental utility.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Quantitative research</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Works with &quot;cold&quot; facts.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Four kinds of approaches</h2>
    </p>
    <h3>Qualitative</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>The <b>descriptive survey method</b> (also called the normative survey method) is appropriate for data derived from simple observational situations.  These situations may be actually physically observed or observed through questionnaire or poll techniques. </li>
      <li>The <b>historical method</b> is appropriate when the data is primarily documentary in nature or literary in form.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>Quantitative </h3>
    <ol start="3">
      <li><b>The analytical survey method</b> is appropriate for data that are quantitative in nature and needs statistical assistance to extract their meaning. </li>
      <li> <b>The experimental method</b> is appropriate for data derived from an experimental control situation, or a pretest-posttest situation in which two separate groups are involved.  Instead of two separate groups one group may be used from which data is derived at two separate intervals.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    <h2>Validity and reliability</h2>
    <p> <b>Validity</b> is concerned with the soundness (or effectiveness) of the measuring instrument:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>What</b> does it measure? </li>
      <li><b>Does it in fact measure</b> what it is supposed to measure? </li>
      <li><b>How well, how comprehensively</b>, does it measure it?</li>
    </ul>
    <p> <b>Reliability</b> deals with <b>accuracy</b>. </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>With what accuracy</b> does the test, instrument, inventory, or questionnaire measure what it is intended to measure?</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Primary and secondary sources</h2>
    <p>The rule of thumb is that primary sources should be used in order to secure integrity. </p>
    <p>There are situations, however, when secondary sources do no distract from the integrity, but these should be carefully evaluated: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>If it is, for example, to record accurately what a certain theologian's point of view is, a primary source such as a book authored by him should be used. </li>
      <li>If, however, the importance lies only in the public perception of what his point of view is, secondary sources such as newspaper reports should be acceptable.</li>
    </ul>
