    <p id="intelliTxt">When they start college students often feel  overwhelmed by the amount of reading they are expected to do&mdash;and many stay that  way throughout their college career. That&rsquo;s unfortunate because there are  methods to improve college reading skills that make it easier and faster to  handle the load. If you want to improve college reading g skills, you need to  learn how to apply three principles. These are the Three E&rsquo;s: efficient, engaged  and effective reading.</p>

      <h4>Things You'll Need</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Note taking materials (handwritten is recommended) </li>
        <li>Book reviews when  appropriate</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>Learn to focus your reading efforts to achieve maximum results. The first  step is to organize your reading so you have an efficient plan (step 2 explains  how to do this). It&rsquo;s equally important to carry out your plan for reading an  assignment, whether it&rsquo;s a textbook, article, or book. Second, you should be an  engaged reader. Don&rsquo;t just go through the motions. As you read think about what  you are reading. Take breaks frequently&mdash;if you become too fatigued you are  simply wasting your time. Finally, develop strategies to be an effective reader  in the sense that you retain the key concepts and facts when you  read.</li>
        <li>Examine each reading assignment before you begin to read. Look at the  author&rsquo;s introduction, preface, or abstract. Most of the time you&rsquo;ll find an  explanation of the main points of the book or article and an outline of the  book.  Read the table of contends carefully to see how the book is organized.  Plan which parts of the text you will read and which you will skip or skim over.  One misconception new college students have is that they should read every word  and that is rarely the case. The only time you need to read everything is if you  are taking an introductory curse (like US History 101). The &ldquo;survey text&rdquo; has to  be read word for word. Most other books do not.</li>

        <li>Read actively. As you read, think about what the author is saying and take  notes as you go. Note taking strategies vary, but you are well advised to  hand-write your notes. This forces you to slow down and think. The physical act  of writing helps you retain the information. &ldquo;Interrogate the text.&rdquo; You&rsquo;ll hear  professors say this sooner or later. What they mean is you should be thinking of  questions and looking for answers in the text&mdash;almost as if you are talking to  the author.
        </li>
        <li>Make effective use of book reviews when you read books. Published book  reviews are written by people who already have advanced degrees and have taken  the time to thoroughly analyze a book. They will give you a capsule of what&rsquo;s in  the book and their views on its quality and value. However, it is a very bad  idea to read a book review before you read the book. If you do you will read  from someone else&rsquo;s perspective instead of our own. Reading one (or more) book  reviews afterward will help you develop your own ideas about what you&rsquo;ve  read.
        
        </li>
        <li>Review your notes and the text you have read a few days later. It is a rare  student who can grasp what they read the first time through. If you&rsquo;ve taken  good notes, you won&rsquo;t need to do much re-reading. Be ready to make additional  notes, though. As you review, you will find new insights and ideas coming into  your mind and you want to write them down. You will have a much better  understanding of what you have read.
        
        </li>
        <li>Develop strategies for committing key ideas and facts to memory. This is  especially important for students facing tests on the material they have read.  There are many techniques for doing this. One very good approach is to write  each key fact and idea down on an index card. Then you can take a set of cards  with you and review them whenever you have a few minutes. The link at the end of  this article will give you other ideas for retaining the information you need to  remember most.
