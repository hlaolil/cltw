<h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>We call this <strong>SQ4R</strong> method a classic because students have found it useful since the   early 60's. It's probably worth your time to try all the steps at first, and   then choose and apply only those that work effectively for each of your course   texts. Although using the SQ4R method may seem time consuming at first, once you   know the steps the process takes only a few minutes. (For a more comprehensive   look at many aspects of reading from textbooks, including improving your   concentration and dealing with difficult textbooks, consult our <a href="learning_from_texts.cfm">Learning from Textbooks</a> handout.)</p>
      <h2>S = Survey</h2>
      <p>Before you crack open your book to page one and dive in, take a few minutes   to read the preface and introduction to the text, and browse through the table   of contents and the index. This will tell you the main topics that the book will   cover, the author's particular approach to the subject (i.e., why he/she wrote   another text on the subject when there are probably twenty on the market), and   what the basic organizational structure will be.</p>
      <p>A similar process is repeated before each chapter. Read all the titles and   subtitles, study any pictures, charts or graphs, and, if there are any, read the   summary at the end of the chapter and any study questions. Surveying a chapter   in this way gives you the &quot;big picture,&quot;; a framework of the main ideas which   will help to hold the details together later.</p>
      <h2>Q = Question</h2>
      <p>Before beginning to read, take the subtitle of the section (or the first   sentence of a paragraph) and turn it into a question. For example, if you're   reading part of a chapter called &quot;Functions of the Spinal Cord,&quot; ask yourself,   &quot;What are the functions of the spinal cord?&quot;</p>
      <h2>R#1 = Read</h2>
      <p>You then read, not passively sliding your eyes over the words, but actively   engaging the text, trying to find the answer to your question. Be cautious,   however, that you don't end up skimming for the answer to your question and   missing other important information.</p>
      <h2>R#2 = Respond</h2>
      <p>Once you've read the section, close the textbook and answer your question,   either orally or on paper, <strong>in your own words</strong>. If you can't   answer the question, you should reread that section until you can. If, after   several tries, you still can't answer your question, go on to the next few   sections and see if things become clearer. You may find that you need to change   your question. For example, you may have first posed the question, &quot;What is the   Treaty of Versailles?&quot; for the subtitle &quot;The Treaty of Versailles,&quot; but, after   reading the section, you may find that a better question is, &quot;;Why was the   Treaty of Versailles created?&quot; If changing your question doesn't help clarify   the reading, it's time to get some help. Your instructor or TA are good places   to start, or Learning Services in the Learning Commons can also help with   effective reading strategies.</p>
      <h2>R#3 = Record</h2>
      <p>Once you've understood the material and can summarize it in your own words,   the next step is to record the information in some way. Some common methods are   to highlight and/or mark the text, or take notes, or some combination of both.   Whichever method or combination of methods you choose (some pros and cons are   summarized next), it's critical to remember to read and understand the material <strong>first</strong>, and then go back and record.</p>
      <h3>Highlighting</h3>
      <h4>The Pros</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Takes less time than note taking. </li>
        <li>Charts and graphs from text readily available. </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>The Cons</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Very easy to do badly; can fool you into thinking you're learning material   when what you're really doing is colouring. </li>
        <li>Tendency to mark too much to avoid missing something important; experts say   highlight 10-15%; students usually highlight 70-80%. </li>
        <li>Because fragments of sentences are highlighted, tendency is to read whole   sentence for complete meaning and so most of the book ends up being re-read. </li>
        <li>Necessary to study for tests from heavy, clumsy textbook. </li>
        <li>Difficult to integrate with lecture notes. </li>
        <li>Textbook ends up looking very used and reduces resale value. </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Notetaking</h3>
      <h4>The Pros</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Because it's time consuming, encourages you to be concise and more selective   of important information. </li>
        <li>Information is in point form but still grammatically complete. </li>
        <li>Provides a portable, easy-to-manage study tool &mdash; text not often needed for   studying. </li>
        <li>Condensed study notes can be made in margins as you go, saving time when   preparing for exams. </li>
        <li>Easy to integrate text and lecture notes if done on looseleaf paper. </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>The Cons</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Time-consuming. </li>
        <li>Tendency to copy text rather than take notes in your own words. </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>R#4 = Review</h2>
      <p>In courses where there is a lot of factual material to remember, a regular   review period (usually once a week) can be a very effective strategy for   retaining information. Integrating a weekly review period into your study   routine will help you remember more of the information longer, thereby changing   the nature of the studying done at exam time. Rather than relearning material   that has been forgotten because you haven't looked at it since reading it or   writing it down, preparing for an exam can include a review of familiar material   and rehearsal strategies like trying old exams.</p>
      <p>The secret to making regular review periods effective is to start <strong>from the beginning</strong> of the course in each review session. The   volume of material to review increases as the semester progresses, but the   amount of time needed to review older material decreases. After you've reviewed   the first week's material a few times, it will take only minutes to skim over it   and recall the key points.</p>
