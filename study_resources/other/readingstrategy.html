        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ask yourself pre-reading questions.</strong> For example:  What is   the topic, and what do you already know about it?  Why has the instructor   assigned this reading at this point in the semester? </li>
          <li><strong>Identify and define any unfamiliar terms.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Bracket the main idea or thesis of the reading, and put an asterisk   next to it. </strong>Pay particular attention to the introduction or opening   paragraphs to locate this information. </li>
          <li><strong>Put down your highlighter.  Make marginal notes or comments   instead.</strong> Every time you feel the urge to highlight something, write   instead. You can summarize the text, ask questions, give assent, protest   vehemently. You can also write down key words to help you recall where important   points are discussed. Above all, strive to enter into a dialogue with the   author. </li>
          <li><strong>Write questions in the margins, and then answer the questions in a   reading journal or on a separate piece of paper.</strong> If you&rsquo;re reading a   textbook, try changing all the titles, subtitles, sections and paragraph   headings into questions.  For example, the section heading &ldquo;The Gas Laws of   Boyle, Charles, and Avogadro&rdquo; might become &ldquo;What are the gas laws of Boyle,   Charles, and Avogadro?&rdquo; </li>
          <li><strong>Make outlines, flow charts, or diagrams that help you to map and to   understand ideas visually. </strong> (See below for examples). </li>
          <li><strong>Read each paragraph carefully and then determine &quot;what it says&quot; and   &ldquo;what it does.&rdquo; Answer &ldquo;what it says&rdquo; in only one sentence.</strong> Represent   the main idea of the paragraph in your own words. To answer &ldquo;what it does,&rdquo;   describe the paragraph&rsquo;s purpose within the text, such as &ldquo;provides evidence for   the author&rsquo;s first main reason&rdquo; or &ldquo;introduces an opposing view.&rdquo; </li>
          <li><strong>Write a summary of an essay or chapter in your own words.</strong> Do this in less than a page. Capture the essential ideas and perhaps one or two   key examples. This approach offers a great way to be sure that you know what the   reading really says or is about. </li>
          <li><strong>Write your own exam question based on the reading.</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Teach what you have learned to someone else!</strong> Research   clearly shows that teaching is one of the most effective ways to learn. If you   try to explain aloud what you have been studying, (1) you&rsquo;ll transfer the   information from short-term to long-term memory, and (2) you&rsquo;ll quickly discover   what you understand &mdash; and what you don&rsquo;t. </li>
