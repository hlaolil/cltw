    <h1>MLA Style Rules</h1>
    <p class="p8" id="lblu">A series of articles on the basics of <b>Academic Writing</b> </p>
    <p id="dred"> <b>Specific direction to write and format an academic document</b> </p>

    <p> There is no universally accepted format for formatting and documenting <a title="The quoting of a book or author."><b>citations</b></a> in academic writing. Different <a title="A branch of learning or instruction"><b>disciplines</b></a>, and even different journals within a discipline, are each likely to have their own partly rational and partly idiosyncratic customs and rules. Indeed an important part of scholarly training is learning what the rules are in one's particular field, so one can <b>display the right kind of learning and professionalization</b>. Fortunately for students and writing guides, a few documentation styles are especially widely used.
      There are four common documentation styles in the USA: MLA, which is widely used in <a title="The study of literature, philosophy and the arts."><b>the humanities</b></a>; APA, widely used in the <a title="The study of society and of relationship of individual members within society, including economics, history, political science, psychology, antropology and sociology."><b>social sciences</b></a>; Chicago, also common in those two areas (and the format for those who favour <b>footnotes</b>); and CBE, widely used in the <a title="The sciences that are involved in the study of the physical world and its phenomena, including biology, physics, chemistry, and geology."><b>natural sciences</b></a>. You will need to use only one of these four to help you navigate most of the documentation formats you'll face in the typical range of college courses. In this article we will only concentrate on the first one, <b>MLA Style</b>.</p>
    <h2 id="doc"> MLA document formats </h2>
    <p> In the humanities the most influential writing and documentation style is that of the Modern Language Association of America (MLA), one of the largest academic organizations in the world. MLA documentation style is common in English, foreign languages, comparative literature, and other humanities courses. </p>
    <p> <b>Basics of Writing</b> presents here a concise guide to MLA style. The full MLA format is available in a book, The MLA Handbook for Writers of Research Papers, 5th ed., which can be ordered directly from the MLA (http://www.mla.org). It is aimed primarily at undergraduates. Graduate students and professional scholars may wish to consult the MLA Style Manual and Guide to Scholarly Publishing, 2nd ed., which contains helpful information on publication. It can also be ordered from the MLA. </p>
    <h3> Paper and binding</h3>
    <p> Use sturdy white, unlined A4 or 8.5&quot; by 11&quot; paper. Essays should be stapled or paper-clipped in the upper left corner. Don't use binders or plastic covers unless your lecturer/teacher wants them, nor should you hold your paper together by folding or tearing pages. </p>
    <hr />
    <h3> Margins, line spacing, and paragraphs</h3>
    <p> Except for page numbers (see below), use margins of 25mm on all sides. The essay or report should be double-spaced throughout (including quotations, notes, and the list of works cited), with no blank lines between paragraphs. <br />
      The first line of each new paragraph is indented a half-inch on the left. <br />
      Set-off quotations are indented one 25mm on the left. </p>
    <p> Text runs flush-left and ragged right. </p>
    <p><b>Calvary University would accept a more individualistic style</b> that reads as follows:<br />
    </p>
    <blockquote>Except for page numbers, use margins of 20-25mm on all sides. The essay or report could be single-spaced throughout (including quotations, notes, and the list of works cited), with blank lines between paragraphs.Set-off quotations are indented 10mm or 15mm on the left.<br />
      Text runs flush-left and ragged right (or justified).</blockquote>
    </p>
    <hr />
    <h3> Printing and fonts</h3>
    <p> Type or print; don't turn in handwritten formal work. Print on only one side of the page, in black ink. Use a plain serif or sans-serif font&mdash;no cursive fonts, for instance. Good serif choices are Times Roman and Palatino; good non-serif choices are Arial and Helvetica. </p>
    <p> Traditional MLA style prefers underlining to italics, but this is gradually changing as high-quality printers become the norm. Use italics for emphasis if your teacher allows. </p>
    <hr />
    <h3> Page numbers </h3>
    <p> Starting with the first page, put page numbers a half-inch (15mm) from the top edge of the paper, flush with the right margin. Type your last name before the page number (Harvey 1), in case the page comes loose. Word processors automate this process, so make sure you know how to use the pagination command.<br />
      <b>Note</b>:For Calvary &ndash; alternately, page numbers may also be placed at the bottom of the page in the same way as described. </p>
    <hr />
    <h3> Spaces between sentences</h3>
    <p> In the old days of typewriters and nonproportional fonts (in which every letter, from i to w, takes up the same space), the rule was to put two spaces between sentences to improve readability. But if you print from a computer, you should put just one space between sentences. </p>
    <hr />
    <h3> Heading </h3>
    <p> At the top of the first page of the essay or academic report (below the top margin, of course, and flush with the left margin), place your name, your professor's name, the course name or number (including section number if the course has multiple sections), and the date you're turning in the report, each on a separate line with double-spacing throughout. </p>
    <hr />
    <h3> Title </h3>
    <p> Research papers need a title page. Alternately place a centered title on the first page of the essay, separated from the heading by a blank line. If the title extends to a second line, double space between the lines and again to the first line of the essay (with no blank line). Don't italicize or underline the title (though if you use a book title in your paper's title, you should italicize or underline it). </p>
    <p> Make sure your essay has a meaningful title that is more than a bare-bones identifier (not <i>Essay #1</i> or <i>Essay on Management</i>). It should signal to the reader what your essay is about (like Deming's Total Quality Management Perspective or Jefferson on Slavery). A common academic device to create a bit of elegance is to use a title and subtitle, separating them with a colon. Typically the titles are balanced so that one is broad and the other more focused, or one uses a key term and the other starts to delimit and explain it: </p>
    <p id="cen"> Mysteries of State: An Absolute Concept and its Late Medieval Origins </p>
    <p> Often you'll see a pithy quoted fragment before the colon: </p>
    <p id="cen"> &quot;Hell Strives With Grace&quot;: Reflections on the Theme of Providence in Marlowe </p>
    <p> Here's an example of the first page of a paper, MLA-style: </p>
    <p align="right"> Harvey 1 </p>
    <p class="cp"> Michael Harvey </p>
    <p class="cp"> Professor Lowi </p>
    <p class="cp"> Politics 101 </p>
    <p class="cp"> 11 November 2000 </p>
    <p id="cen"> Lost in the Wilderness: Love and Longing in &quot;L'Asino&quot; </p>
    <p> &nbsp; &nbsp; One of the chief themes in Machiavelli's work is that the political actor must not be restrained by any sentimental tenderness, whether self-pity or compassion for others. The political actor must be able to act freely, without being checked by such qualms. The best political actor, Machiavelli insists, never takes off his armour. His startling condemnation of Cesare Borgia in The Prince, after almost a whole chapter of unstinting praise, can be understood from this perspective: in the end Machiavelli says Borgia fell because at one critical moment, after a life time of treachery, he was too soft, allowing  ... </p>
    <hr />
    <h3> Late corrections </h3>
    <p> Sometimes you will discover mistakes in what you thought was a final draft, when you no longer have time to print out a corrected version. In such cases, you should hand-correct the printed version (that's one reason to double-space essays). It's usually okay to turn in an essay with one or two such corrections. How to do it: Cross out the mistake with a single horizontal line. Mark the insertion point with a caret (^). Neatly write in the correction above the printed line. Don't write below the line or in the margin. If you need to make a more substantial correction, make a clean printout. <br />
      <img src="correct.gif" width="250" height="50" border="0" title="Correction done by hand" alt="Correction done by hand" /> </p>
    <h2 id="sty"> Basic MLA citation style </h2>
    <p> The basic MLA <a title="The quoting of a book or author."><b>citation</b></a>style consists of a brief in-text citation keyed to a reference in an alphabetical list of works included at the end of the paper. A complete citation thus has two parts: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>an in-text citation in the body of the paper, and </li>
      <li>a bibliographic reference in the list of works cited. </li>
    </ol>
    <p> The point is to improve readability by minimizing interruptions in the body of the paper. </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p> <b>(1) In-text citation</b> </p>
      <p> The novel opens evocatively, with a beginning that sounds almost like an ending: &quot;So the beginning of this was a woman and she had come back from burying the dead&quot; (Hurston 9). </p>
      <p> <b>(2) Reference in the list of works cited</b> </p>
      <p> Hurston, Zora Neale. <i>Their Eyes Were Watching God</i> (Urbana: U of Illinois P, 1978). </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> A pointer to the specific passage quoted, denoted usually by a page number, is included in the in-text citation, along with an identifier (generally the author's name) that points to a specific reference. The reference includes the full bibliographic information one would need to find the book in a library. </p>
    <p> Let's look first at how in-text citations work, then at the list of works cited and its references, and then turn to detailed formats for citing and referencing different kinds of sources.</p>
    <h2 id="int"> In-text citations</h2>
    <p> A typical in-text citation is simple: an author and usually a page reference (with <i>no</i> addition like <i>page</i> or <i>pg</i>. or <i>p</i>.): (Colleran 99). In-text citations are often referred to as parenthetical citations, but this term can be misleading because some citations don't require a parenthetical element: </p>
    <p id="ind"> Allen, for instance, believes that the dialogue is ironic. </p>
    <p> And some need only a parenthetical: </p>
    <p id="ind"> On the other hand, the dialogue can be understood as ironic (Allen). </p>
    <p> The author's last name is sufficient to point the reader to a unique reference in the list of works cited (this reference is to the whole work, which is why a specific page reference is not included. If a specific passage were being referred to, it should be denoted by a page reference). </p>
    <hr />
    <p> Most often in-text citations comprise two elements: a <b>signal phrase</b> or pointer in the body of the paper, and a <a title="An explanatory phrase inserted in a text with which it is not gramatically connected, and marked off by brackets, dashes, etc."><b>parenthetical</b></a>: </p>
    <p> ???? </p>
    <p> The signal phrase and parenthetical should divide up, not duplicate, the citation data:</p>
    <table width="460" cellpadding="5" rules="all" id="ibgb">
      <tr valign="top" class="dbg" id="cen">
        <td width="140">WRONG</td>
        <td>RIGHT</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td> Harry Berger argues that &quot;Mowbray serves as the medium in which are condensed Bolingbroke's darker purposes&quot; (Berger 226). </td>
        <td>Harry Berger argues that &quot;Mowbray serves as the medium in which are condensed Bolingbroke's darker purposes&quot; (226). </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    </p>
    <p> It's okay to repeat information if additional material between the signal phrase and the parenthetical might make for ambiguity: </p>
    <p id="ind"> Berger alerts us to Mowbray's role in the scene, suggesting an alternative to Booth's perspective (Berger 226). </p>
    <p> You'll find more detailed advice on using signal phrases to introduce quotations in the previous section, on Effective quoting, and see the detailed examples below for lots of help with citing different kinds of sources.</p>
    <h2 id="low"> List of works cited </h2>
    <p> MLA style requires you to list your sources with full bibliographic information at the end of the paper. The usual title is &quot;Works Cited.&quot; The list begins on a new page and continues the report's page numbers. Like other page numbers, the page number appears in the upper-right hand corner, 15mm from the top and flush with the right margin (all margins are 25mm). </p>
    <p> The title is centered, 25mm from the top of the page. Double-space between title and the first entry. Each entry begins flush with the left margin, and is then indented 15mm (learn how to do hanging indents in your word processor of choice to manage this; in other words, indent five spaces from the left margin). The whole list is double-spaced with no blank line between entries. <br />
      <b>Note</b>: Alternately: No indent for entries, single spacing with a 3mm (or 12pt) space between paragraphs (entries). </p>

    <h2 id="bib"> Bibliographic references </h2>
    <p> The point of a bibliographic reference is to allow your readers to track down your sources. As the examples in the list of works cited above show, you need to include standard bibliographic information: author, title, place of publication, publisher, and year of publication. </p>
    <h3> Titles</h3>
    <p> Get the title from the title page, not the cover or another source. Give spelled-out equivalents of symbols like &amp;. When a title consists of two phrases on separate lines, join them with a colon. For example, this title page would be listed as <i>Shakespeare Reread: The Texts in New Contexts</i>.</p>
    <table border="2" cellpadding="15" align="center">
      <tr>
        <td><h1>SHAKESPEARE REREAD </h1>
          </p>
          <hr />
          <p id="cen" class="sub"> <i>The Texts in New Contexts</i></p></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <h3> Alphabetization</h3>
    <p> Alphabetize the list by author, or for any anonymous works by title (ignoring but not deleting A, An, and The). </p>
    <h3> Capitalization</h3>
    <p> Capitalize all significant words, regardless of how the original source is capitalized. Capitalize most words except articles (<i>a, an, the</i>), prepositions (<i>of, to, in, against</i>), coordinating conjunctions (<i>and, but, for, nor, or, so, yet)</i>, and the <i>to</i> in infinitives. But if any of these occurs as the first or last word of a title or subtitle, capitalize it. </p>
    <h3> Underlining/italics and quotation marks</h3>
    <p> The titles of works published independently (not within another volume) are typically formatted with underlining (or, increasingly often, italics). These include books, plays, long poems published as books, pamphlets, newspapers, magazines, journals, films, radio and television programs, web sites, CDs, software, ballets, operas, paintings, and other works and artifacts that stand on their own. </p>
    <p> The titles of works published within other works are typically placed in quotation marks. These include articles, essays, stories, short poems, chapters, encyclopedia entries, sections of online documents, songs, and individual episodes of broadcast programs. </p>
    <h3> Titles in titles</h3>
    <p> Underlined (or italicized) titles in quoted titles. Retain the underlining: &quot;Death in <u>Death in Venice</u>.&quot; </p>
    <p> Quoted titles in quoted title. Switch to single quotation marks for the inner title: &quot;Ironic reversal in Nirvana's 'Smells Like Teen Spirit.'&quot; </p>
    <p> Underlined titles in underlined titles. Don't underline or use quotation marks: <i>Stowe's Trumpet: Uncle Tom's Cabin and the Civil War</i>. </p>
    <p> Quoted title in underlined title. Keep the quotation marks: <i>&quot;Sailing to Byzantium&quot; and Modern Memory</i> </p>
    <p> If a quotation-mark title ends a sentence, put the period (but not other punctuation marks like question marks) inside the quotation mark. </p>
    <h3> Exceptions</h3>
    <p> Titles of sacred writings like the Koran or Bible (and all books therein) are not underlined or italicized: &quot;The story of Moses is told mainly in Exodus and Deuteronomy.&quot; </p>
    <p> Neither are the names of laws or other political documents (the U.S. Constitution), musical compositions like symphonies or concertos (Beethoven's Symphony no. 3), series, societies, buildings, conferences, and courses. </p>
    <p> The divisions of a work (preface, introduction, foreword, act, scene, canto, section, etc.) are not underlined or put in quotation marks; nor are they capitalized when used in the text of a paper: &quot;Claudius dominates act 4 of the play.&quot; </p>
    <h3> Shortened titles</h3>
    <p> You may use a shortened form of a title, or an abbreviation, in your text after referring to it once by its full title. Use an obvious short form. The <i>MLA Handbook</i>, which this section on titles closely follows, provides a lengthy list of standard abbreviations for familiar literary works.</p>

    <h3> 3. Two or more works by the same author</h3>
    <p> <b>Citation</b>. If you cite more than work by a scholar in your paper, you must point to the right one in a particular citation by adding a short version of the work's title. This can be done in several ways (note details like the absence or presence of commas): </p>

    <h3> 15. Literary works</h3>
    <p> The custom for citing classic works is a bit different, for a good reason. There are many editions of these works available, so your citation should allow readers to find the original passage in any edition, for instance by including book and chapter numbers after a page reference. </p>
    <p> <b>Citation </b> </p>
    <p id="ind"> Eliot shows, with subtle but devastating power, how the hypocritical Bulstrode and his loyal wife lack the strength to face the truth head on: &quot;She could not say, 'How much is only slander and false suspicion?' and he did not say, 'I am innocent'&quot; (Eliot 551; bk. 8, ch. 74). </p>
    <p> <b>Reference</b> </p>
    <p id="ind"> Eliot, George [Mary Anne Evans]. <i>Middlemarch</i>. Ed. Gordon S. Haight. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1956. </p>
    <hr />
    <h3> 16. Poetry </h3>
    <p> <b>Citation</b>. Omit page numbers when citing classic poems. Instead, cite by textual division (act, scene, canto, book, part, etc.) and line, with periods separating the numbers. However the numbers are formatted in the original, use Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3). Don't label the divisions in parentheticals or use <i>l</i> or <i>ll</i>. to denote lines, because these can be confused with numbers (though you may use division names in the text: &quot;In the sixth canto Dante meets a man transformed into a pig&quot;). If you're only citing line numbers, use the words line or lines followed by the numbers: </p>
    <p id="ind"> Returning to civilian life he struggled toward some semblance of normalcy, &quot;Unloading hell behind him step by step&quot; (Sassoon line 25). </p>
    <p> <b>Reference</b> </p>
    <p id="ind"> Sassoon, Siegfried. &quot;The Rear-Guard.&quot; <i>The Norton Anthology of Modern Poetry</i>. Eds. Richard Ellman and Robert O'Clair. New York: W. W. Norton, 1973. 382. </p>
    <h3> ... Quoting poetry</h3>
    <p> You can quote up to three lines of poetry by incorporating the quotation within your text. To indicate line breaks, use a slash with a space on each side ( / ): </p>
    <p id="ind"> Gray imagines what those buried in the churchyard might have done had they lived: &quot;Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest, / Some Cromwell, guiltless of his country's blood&quot; (47-48). </p>
    <p> If you quote more than three lines, you need to set them off the quotation using the same formats as with other set-off quotations, including a one-inch left indent. You also need to reproduce the poem's appearance as best you can, which means attention to line indentations: </p>
    <p id="ind"> The best-known line of Emerson's &quot;Concord Hymn&quot; comes at the end of the first stanza: </p>
    <p id="ind">&nbsp;</p>
    <blockquote> &nbsp; By the rude bridge that arched the flood,<br />
      Their flag to April's breeze unfurled,<br />
      Here once the embattled farmers stood<br />
      And fired the shot heard round the world. (1-4) </blockquote>
    <p> If the citation wouldn't fit on the same line as the last line of poetry, start it on a new line, flush with the right margin. </p>
    <p> If you choose to begin quoting in the middle of a line of verse, convey that with extra indentation. Ellipsis follows the same format as for prose quotations, except that if you skip one or more whole lines of verse, you need to denote that with a line of spaced periods about the same length as the lines of verse: </p>
    <p id="ind"> Shelley builds the tension of &quot;England in 1819&quot; for more than a dozen lines before the explosive &quot;burst&quot; in the fourteenth line: </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p id="ind"> An old, mad, blind, despised, and dying king,<br />
        Princes, the dregs of their dull race, who flow<br />
        Through public scorn,&mdash;mud from a muddy spring,&mdash;<br />
        Rulers who neither see, nor feel, nor know,<br />
        But leech-like to their fainting country cling,<br />
        . &nbsp; . &nbsp; . &nbsp; . &nbsp; . &nbsp; . &nbsp; . &nbsp; . &nbsp; . &nbsp; . &nbsp; . &nbsp; . &nbsp; . &nbsp; . &nbsp; . &nbsp; <br />
        Are graves, from which a glorious Phantom may <br />
        Burst, to illumine our tempestuous day. (1-5, 13-14) </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p> If a line of verse is too long to fit on a single line in your paper, you may either reduce the left indentation or continue the line with a further indentation of 5mm. </p>
    <hr />
    <h3> 17. Drama</h3>
    <p> As with poetry, omit page numbers when citing classic drama. Instead, cite by textual division (act, scene, etc.) and line, with periods separating the numbers. However the numbers are formatted in the original, use Arabic numerals (1, 2, 3). In parentheticals don't label the divisions or use l or ll. to denote lines, because these can be confused with numbers (but you may use division names in the text: &quot;Claudius dominates act 4 of the play&quot;). </p>
    <p> Plays may be written in prose or verse. Prose presents fewer difficulties, and quotations from prose drama follow the usual MLA conventions for prose quotations. Quoting from verse, however, is more complicated. It's helpful to understand something about the conventions of how verse is written and printed, and how lines are counted. </p>
    <p> ... from Shakespeare's Coriolanus, 5.6 (Act 5 scene 6)
      (as printed in the cited text)
      Line Numbers
      99	CORIOLANUS	Hear'st thou, Mars?
      AUFIDIUS
      Name not the god, thou boy of tears!
      100	CORIOLANUS				Ha!
      AUFIDIUS				No more.
      CORIOLANUS
      101	Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart
      Too great for what contains it. Boy? O slave! </p>
    <p> Shakespeare and many other classic dramatists wrote most often in iambic pentameter, with 10-syllable lines comprising five feet of two syllables each. Such a line doesn't necessarily end when a different character speaks. Line 5.6.100 above, for instance, consists of three utterances. Note that Line 99's formatting indicates it's completing a line already begun. </p>
    <p> <b>Citation</b>. Most often you'll put the work's title in the text, with a line reference in a parenthetical. The following example assumes that the author and text have already been established, as would usually be the case. </p>
    <p id="ind"> Aufidius taunts Coriolanus as a &quot;boy of tears&quot; (5.6.100). </p>
    <p> <b>Reference</b>. There's no need to put the original publication information in unless that's germane to your point. </p>
    <p id="ind"> Shakespeare, William. <i>Coriolanus</i>. Ed. Harry Levin. Rev. ed. Harmondsworth, England: Penguin, 1973. </p>
    <h3> ... Quoting drama </h3>
    <p> If you are only quoting one character and not more than three lines, you may put the quotation within quotation marks in your text. If you're quoting a prose passage, treat it like any prose quotation; if a verse passage, treat it like poetry: </p>
    <p id="ind"> Finally, Antony rises to deliver his famous funeral oration: &quot;Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears; / I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. / The evil that men do lives after them; / The good is oft interr&egrave;d with their bones&quot; (Shakespeare, <i>Julius Caesar</i> 3.2.73-76). </p>
    <p> If you're quoting dialogue or more than three lines of a single speech, set off the quotation. Begin each speech with the character's name in all capitals, indented one inch and punctuated with a period. Subsequent lines of that speech are indented a further quarter-inch. For other details follow the usual formats for prose and poetry. </p>
    <p id="ind"> LAERTES. Must there no more be done?<br />
      DOCTOR. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No more be done.<br />
      We should profane the service of the dead<br />
      To sing a requiem and such rest to her<br />
      As to peace-parted souls.<br />
      LAERTES. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lay her i' th' earth,<br />
      And from her fair and unpolluted flesh<br />
      May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,<br />
      A minist'ring angel shall my sister be<br />
      When thou liest howling. (Shakespeare, <i>Hamlet</i> 5.1.222-30) </p>
    <hr />
    <h3> 18. The Bible</h3>
    <p> <b>Citation</b>. Cite chapter and verse, not page number: (Genesis 5:14). </p>
    <p> <b>Reference</b>. It's important to indicate the version used, not publisher information, unless it's a scholarly edition. </p>
    <p id="ind"> Bible. King James Version. </p>
    <hr />
    <h3> 19. A government publication</h3>
    <p> <b>Citation</b>. As usual, though you will need to make sure your author pointer leads to the right citation (most gracefully, usually, by putting some of the multilevel author information in the text). </p>
    <p> <b>Reference</b>. If you're uncertain of the author, treat the issuing government agency or body as author, starting at the top level of the government and working down (Cong. stands for Congress). </p>
    <p id="ind"> United States. Cong. House. </p>
    <p> For subsequent documents issued by the same government, use &mdash;. Note that this is an exception to the long-hyphen rule: you may combine hyphens and names. </p>

    <p id="ind"> &mdash;. &mdash;. Senate. </p>
    <p id="ind"> &mdash;. Environmental Protection Agency. </p>
    <p> For the <i>Congressional Record</i> use the abbreviation <i>Cong. Rec.</i> and give only the date and page numbers: <i>Cong. Rec.</i> 7 May 2000: 17528-639. </p>
    <p> For other congressional documents , include the number and session of Congress, the house (S stands for Senate, H and HR for House of Representatives), and the type and number of the publication. Types of congressional publications include public laws (P.L. 106-4), bills (S 102, HR 433), resolutions (S. Res. 27, H. Res. 8), reports (S. Rept. 106-350, H. Rept. 89), and documents (S. Doc. 117, H. Doc. 328). </p>

    <h2 id="ref"> MLA Internet citations and references </h2>
    <p> Many citations of online sources in college papers are inadequate. Here's an all-too-common example: <strong>www.hoovers.com</strong>. </p>
    <p> What's missing? Lots&mdash;information about the type of online resource, a specific URL to a particular document, and data on author, title, when online material was posted, and when you retrieved it (that means when you downloaded or printed the information, not when you wrote it into your paper). It's important to provide dates because the web is a dynamic medium, with content and web sites constantly changing. </p>
    <p> References to online documents follow the same basic format as other MLA references: alphabetization by author, a title, and publication information. One difference: references to online documents typically have two dates, the date the material was posted or updated, and the date it was retrieved. Since the web is a dynamic medium with content and web sites constantly changing, it's helpful to your reader to note posting and retrieval dates. </p>
    <hr />
    <h3> What are you citing?</h3>
    <p> The first thing you have to decide for an online reference is whether the reference should be to an entire site or a particular document at a site. Here's the basic format for a reference to an entire web site. </p>
    <p id="ind"> Harvey, Michael. <i>The Nuts and Bolts of College Writing</i>.<br />
      Indianapolis. Hacket, 2000. <b><br />
        1 September 2000</b> &lt;<u>http:www.nutsandboltsguide.com</u>/&gt; <br />
      (Indicating <b>retrieval date</b> and <b>URL</b>) </p>
    <p> If you are going to be citing just one portion of the site, it will be more helpful to your reader to direct him to the specific section and URL: </p>
    <p> Harvey, Michael. &quot;The Process of Writing.&quot; <i>The Nuts and Bolts of College Writing</i>. Indianapolis: Hackett, 2000. 1 September 2000 &lt;http://nutsandbolts.washcoll.edu/process.htm&gt;. </p>
    <p> But if you cite several different sections from one site, then things can get a bit complicated. If the citations are to different sections of a particular document, then make the bibliographic reference to the whole document (like the first example above) and use in-text signal phrases to direct your reader more specifically: </p>
    <p id="ind"> In the section entitled &quot;Style,&quot; Harvey says most college students use the passive voice too frequently. </p>
    <hr />
    <p id="ind"> &quot;Many students use a writing style that makes clarity difficult or impossible to achieve&quot; (Harvey &quot;Clarity&quot;). </p>
    <p> The author's name would point to the particular reference; the title in quotation marks would denote a section within the whole work in the reference. (Naturally, if the list of works cited has more than one work by the author, or works by other authors with the same last name, you'll have to add more specific information to the citation (see above for more help with this). </p>
    <hr />
    <p> But if the citations are to different documents or kinds of online material&mdash;especially with different authors&mdash;it's best to put in a separate reference for each, even if they're accessed from the same central page. Keep in mind the underlying rationale: what will make it easier for readers to find your sources for themselves? </p>

    <h3> The page problem</h3>
    <p> One complication of online documents is that they usually lack page numbers, so it's not easy to point readers to particular passages. In order to direct readers as closely as possible to the right source passage, use whatever divisions the work is formatted in. Look for division numbers, section titles or for words like Introduction and Conclusion (see above for MLA style on quotation marks and underlining or italics for different kinds of titles). </p>
    <hr />
    <h3> What's your source?</h3>
    <p> Another source of confusion with online documents is the profusion of uncontrolled copies of texts. With the way the Internet works, anyone can post any document, accurate or not, for public access. In general, make sure that if you're quoting from a text you try to track down the copyright holder or other responsible organization, rather than taking the text and URL from a personal page or other idiosyncratic source. For instance, cite government documents from the Government Printing Office's website (http://www.access.gpo.gov/) or similar source. Doing so increases the chances you'll get an accurate copy, and it reassures readers about your scholarly care. For more on online research, see the <b>Nuts and Bolts</b> section on Research and the Internet. </p>

    <h3> Elements of a reference to an online source</h3>
    <p> The MLA Handbook provides a detailed list of possible items to include in a reference, here listed in order of usual appearance. As the examples above show, not all the items need be included in any single reference, but this list will help you decide how to construct and order references for which you don't find examples here: </p>
    <ol>
      <li> <b>Name of author</b> or other person responsible for the work (editor, translator, etc.), denoted by the usual MLA abbreviation (ed., trans., etc.&mdash;see the various examples above). </li>
      <li><b>Title of short work</b> (article, essay, etc.) in a larger database or work, in quotation marks. </li>
      <li><b>Title of a book</b> or other self-standing document, in italics or underlined. </li>
      <li><b>Name of editor</b>, translator, etc. of a book (unless used earlier), following usual MLA formats. </li>
      <li><b>Publication information</b> for a print version. </li>
      <li><b>Title of the web site</b>, database, periodical, or scholarly project, etc. (italicized or underlined); or for untitled and untitleable sites, a descriptive term like Home page. </li>
      <li><b>Name of editor</b> or person responsible for the web site, database, periodical, or scholarly project, etc. </li>
      <li><b>Version number</b> (if not part of the title); or volume or issue number. </li>
      <li><b>Most recent date</b> of posting or updating. </li>
      <li><b>Name of the organization</b>(s) responsible for or associated with the web site. </li>
      <li><b>Retrieval date</b> (date you retrieved the information), in the format 1 Jan. 2000. </li>
      <li><b>URL</b> (in angle brackets and underlined). </li>
    </ol>

    <p> As noted earlier, don't be too quick to give a corporate web site as the URL for specific documents. If you cite several documents or pages emanating from an organization's web site, it's almost always more useful and workable to provide a reference for each separate text. </p>

    <h2 id="not"> Notes </h2>
    <p> In MLA documentation style endnotes or footnotes may be used for comments that may not fit well in the body of the essay, such as evaluative comments on sources. Here are some typical kinds of comments that might go in footnotes or endnotes. Note that a space goes between the number and the text of the note. </p>
    <hr />
    <p> An acknowledgment, numbered &quot;1&quot; and attached to the title or first sentence of the essay. </p>
    <p id="ind"> <font size="-1">1</font> Thanks to the Society of Junior Fellows for generous research support. </p>
    <hr />
    <p> A note on method, attached to the first citation of pertinent material. </p>
