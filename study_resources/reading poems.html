		  <h2><a name="starting"></a>Read with a pencil</h2>
             <p>Read a poem with a pencil in your hand.</p>
              <p> Mark it up; write in the margins; react to it; get involved with it. Circle important, or striking, or repeated words. Draw lines to connect related ideas. Mark difficult or confusing words, lines, and passages. </p>
              <p>Read through the poem, several times if you can, both silently and aloud.</p>
              
				  <h2><a name="basic"></a>Examine the basic subject of the poem</h2>
             <ul>
                <li> 
                  <p>Consider the<strong> title</strong> of the poem carefully. 
                    What does it tell you about the poem's subject, tone, and 
                    genre? What does it promise? (After having read the poem, 
                    you will want to come back to the title in order to consider 
                    further its relationship with the poem.) </p>
                <li> 
                  <p>What is your initial impression of the poem's <strong>subject</strong>? 
                    Try writing out an answer to the question, &quot;What is this 
                    poem about?&quot;--and then return to this question throughout 
                    your analysis. Push yourself to be precise; aim for more than 
                    just a vague impression of the poem. What is the author's 
                    attitude toward his or her subject? </p>
                <li> 
                  <p>What is the poem's basic <strong>situation</strong>? What 
                    is going on in it? Who is talking? To whom? Under what circumstances? 
                    Where? About what? Why? Is a story being told? Is something--tangible 
                    or intangible--being described? What specifically can you 
                    point to in the poem to support your answers? </p>
                <li> 
                  <p>Because a poem is highly compressed, it may help you to try 
                    to unfold it by <strong>paraphrasing the poem aloud</strong>, 
                    moving line by line through it. If the poem is written in 
                    sentences, can you figure out what the subject of each one 
                    is? The verb? The object of the verb? What a modifier refers 
                    to? Try to untie any syntactic knots. </p>
                <li> 
                  <p>Is the poem built on a <strong>comparison</strong> or <strong>analogy</strong>? 
                    If so, how is the comparison appropriate? How are the two 
                    things alike? How different? </p>
                <li> 
                  <p>What is the author's <strong>attitude</strong> toward his 
                    subject? Serious? Reverent? Ironic? Satiric? Ambivalent? Hostile? 
                    Humorous? Detached? Witty? </p>
                <li> 
                  <p>Does the poem appeal to a reader's intellect? Emotions? Reason?</p>
              </ul>
              
				  <h2><a name="context"></a>Consider the context of the poem</h2>
             <ul>
                <li> 
                  <p>Are there any <strong>allusions</strong> to other literary 
                    or historical figures or events? How do these add to the poem? 
                    How are they appropriate? </p>
                <li> What do you know about this <strong>poet</strong>? About 
                  the age in which he or she wrote this poem? About other works 
                  by the same author? 
              </ul>
              
				  <h2><a name="form"></a>Study the form of the poem</h2>
              <ul>
                <li> 
                  <p>Consider the<strong> sound</strong> and <strong>rhythm</strong> 
                    of the poem. Is there a metrical pattern? If so, how regular 
                    is it? Does the poet use rhyme? What do the meter and rhyme 
                    emphasize? Is there any alliteration? Assonance? Onomatopoeia? 
                    How do these relate to the poem's meaning? What effect do 
                    they create in the poem? </p>
                <li> 
                  <p>Are there <strong>divisions</strong> within the poem? Marked 
                    by stanzas? By rhyme? By shifts in subject? By shifts in perspective? 
                    How do these parts relate to each other? How are they appropriate 
                    for this poem? </p>
                <li> 
                  <p>How are the ideas in the poem <strong>ordered</strong>? Is 
                    there a progression of some sort? From simple to complex? 
                    From outer to inner? From past to present? From one place 
                    to another? Is there a climax of any sort? </p>
                <li> 
                  <p>What are the<strong> form</strong> and <strong>genre</strong> 
                    of this poem? What should you expect from such a poem? How 
                    does the poet use the form? </p>
              </ul>
              </td>
		<h2><a name="word"></a>Look at the word choice of the poem</h2>
             <ul>
                <li> 
                  <p>One way to see the action in a poem is to list all its <strong>verbs</strong>. 
                    What do they tell you about the poem? </p>
                <li> 
                  <p>Are there <strong>difficult</strong> or<strong> confusing 
                    </strong>words? Even if you are only the slightest bit unsure 
                    about the meaning of a word, look it up in a good dictionary. 
                    If you are reading poetry written before the twentieth century, 
                    learn to use the <em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>, which can 
                    tell you how a word's definition and usage have changed over 
                    time. Be sure that you determine how a word is being used--as 
                    a noun, verb, adjective, adverb--so that you can find its 
                    appropriate meaning. Be sure also to consider various possible 
                    meanings of a word and be alert to subtle differences between 
                    words. A good poet uses language very carefully; as a good 
                    reader you in turn must be equally sensitive to the implications 
                    of word choice. </p>
                <li> 
                  <p>What<strong> mood</strong> is evoked in the poem? How is 
                    this accomplished? Consider the ways in which not only the 
                    meanings of words but also their sound and the poem's rhythms 
                    help to create its mood. </p>
                <li> 
                  <p>Is the language in the poem <strong>abstract</strong> or 
                    <strong>concrete</strong>? How is this appropriate to the 
                    poem's subject? </p>
                <li> 
                  <p>Are there any consistent <strong>patterns</strong> of words? 
                    For example, are there several references to flowers, or water, 
                    or politics, or religion in the poem? Look for groups of similar 
                    words. </p>
                <li> 
                  <p>Does the poet use <strong>figurative language</strong>? Are 
                    there metaphors in the poem? Similes? Is there any personification? 
                    Consider the appropriateness of such comparisons. Try to see 
                    why the poet chose a particular metaphor as opposed to other 
                    possible ones. Is there a pattern of any sort to the metaphors? 
                    Is there any metonymy in the poem? Synechdoche? Hyperbole? 
                    Oxymoron? Paradox? A dictionary of literary terms may be helpful 
                    here. </p>
              </ul>

		<h2><a name="finishing"></a>Finishing Up</h2>
             <ul>
                <li>Ask, finally, about the poem, &quot;So what?&quot; What does 
                  it do? What does it say? What is its purpose? </li>
              </ul>
