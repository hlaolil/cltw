    <h3>Local Support Group</h3>
    <p> Students are strongly encouraged to form local support groups (a study group). These are invaluable for discussion and mutual support. Establishing a support group counters the lack of face-to-face contact and support from academic tutors and peers in distance learning (e-learning). Support groups can involve many types of activities of which the following are some examples: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Group discussions </li>
      <li>Group discussions on work done in assignments, tasks, review questions, etc </li>
      <li>Group problem solving </li>
      <li>Presentations by guest speakers and peers </li>
      <li>Group tasks and projects </li>
      <li>Group visits to business organisations, factories, etc </li>
      <li>Workshops</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Learning Management</h3>
    <p> The following aspects of learning management are included in the course materials. These provide skills and knowledge to develop the learning, personal, social and career-related skills: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>An introductory course in study skills for students going to university for the first time. The aim is to equip students with key skills that enable success in the highly competitive era of mass higher education. Students are also equipped to cope with the increasing trend toward independent study and lifelong learning. This course includes the following topics:
        <ol>
          <li>Learning to learn </li>
          <li>Managing stress and time </li>
          <li>Group working skills </li>
          <li>Finding information </li>
          <li>Reading for study </li>
          <li>Taking notes </li>
          <li>Working with numbers </li>
          <li>Essay writing </li>
          <li>Writing reports and dissertations </li>
          <li>Case studies </li>
          <li>Presentations </li>
          <li>Examinations</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>An online writing centre that provides links to online directories, thesauruses, writing tutors, style and grammar guides, and additional tools </li>
      <li>Online self-assessment libraries for assessing your skills, abilities and interests </li>
      <li>Online skills development exercises </li>
      <li>Study aid on the Course CD</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Administrative Staff</h3>
    <p> Academic and administrative staff maintains an open door policy and are proficient in giving advice and general support to students or potential students concerning: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Administrative routines and requirements </li>
      <li>All aspects of the curriculum </li>
      <li>Fee structures and payment of fees </li>
      <li>Complaints </li>
      <li>Administrative questions and problems </li>
      <li>RPL matters </li>
      <li>Personal barriers to study </li>
      <li>Application and registration procedures </li>
      <li>Any other administrative matters</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Continuous Assessment Process</h3>
    <p> The assessment process conducted by CU provides valuable support to students during their engagement with a programme or course by embracing the concept of continuous assessment. </p>
    <p> <b class="alt5">Continuous assessment</b> is an ongoing process that tracks and measures a student's achievements during the programme. Regular assessments of performance provide information that is used to support a student's development. It also enables improvements to be made in the learning process. Continuous assessment provides the ideal relationship between formative and summative assessment and embraces both types of assessment. </p>
    <p> <b class="alt3">Summative assessment</b> is conducted after the student has completed sections of a learning programme or course. It is, therefore, not confined to a single written examination because you are continuously assessed and are not required to write yearly or half-yearly examinations. You are credited for each assessment and these credits accumulate until conditions have been met for the awarding of a qualification. </p>
    <p> <b class="alt2">Formative assessment</b> refers to assessment that takes place during the process of learning and is used to support the student developmentally. It gives the student feedback during the learning process.</p>
